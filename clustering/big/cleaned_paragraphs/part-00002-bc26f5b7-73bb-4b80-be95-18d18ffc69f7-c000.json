Sunday saw the social media giant facing a backlash on how a political data firm (Cambridge Analytica) that was linked to Trump’s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without users being informed.","Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data “to target political advertising and manipulate voters.”","One thing Facebook did was to suspend Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie from its platform along with Instagram. Naturally, the company is acting in surprise but Wylie blew the whistle on them, and Mark Zuckerberg and company have some major scrambling to do. This only gives the government more reason to regulate social media platforms now.","Facebook has a problem it just can’t kick: People keep exploiting it in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy.","News reports that Facebook let the Trump-affiliated data mining firm Cambridge Analytica abscond with data from tens of millions of users mark the third time in roughly a year the company appears to have been outfoxed by crafty outsiders in this way.","In the previous cases, Facebook initially downplayed the risks posed by these activities. It only seriously grappled with fake news and Russian influence after sustained criticism from users, experts, and politicians. In the case of Cambridge, Facebook says the main problem involved the transfer of data to a third party — not its collection in the first place.","Each new issue has also raised the same enduring questions about Facebook’s conflicting priorities — to protect its users, but also to ensure that it can exploit their personal details to fuel its hugely lucrative, and precisely targeted, advertising business.","Facebook may say its business model is to connect the world, but it’s really “to collect psychosocial data on users and sell that to advertisers.” said Mike Caulfield, a faculty trainer at Washington State University who directs a multi-university effort focused on digital literacy.","Late Friday, Facebook announced it was banning Cambridge, an outfit that helped Donald Trump win the White House, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test. Facebook first learned of this breach of privacy more than two years ago, but hasn’t mentioned it publicly until now.","And the company may still be playing down its scope. Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge employee who served as a key source for detailed investigative reports published Saturday in The New York Times and The Guardian, said the firm was actually able to pull in data from roughly 50 million profiles by extending its tentacles to the unwitting friends of app users. (Facebook has since barred such second-hand data collection by apps.)","Wylie said he regrets the role he played in what he called “a full service propaganda machine.” Cambridge’s goal, he told the Guardian in a video interview, was to use the Facebook data to build detailed profiles that could be used to identify and then to target individual voters with personalized political messages calculated to sway their opinions.","“It was a grossly unethical experiment,” Wylie said. “Because you are playing with an entire country. The psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.”","Cambridge has denied wrongdoing and calls Wylie a disgruntled former employee. It acknowledged obtaining user data in violation of Facebook policies but blamed a middleman contractor for the problem. The company said it never used the data and deleted it all once it learned of the infraction — an assertion contradicted by Wylie and now under investigation by Facebook.","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, said Facebook badly needs to embrace the transparency it has essentially forced on its users by sharing their habits, likes and dislikes with advertisers. Albright has previously noted cases in which Facebook deleted thousands of posts detailing Russian influence on its service and underreported the audience for Russian posts by failing to mention millions of followers on Instagram, which Facebook owns.","Facebook is “withholding information to the point of negligence,” he said Saturday. “How many times can you keep doing that before it gets to the point where you’re not going to be able to wrangle your way out?”","The Cambridge imbroglio also revealed what appear to be loopholes in Facebook’s privacy assurances, particularly regarding third-party apps. Facebook appears to have no technical way to enforce privacy promises made by app developers, leaving users little choice but to simply trust them.","In fact, the enforcement actions outlined in Facebook’s statement don’t address prevention at all — just ways to respond to violations after they’ve occurred.","On Saturday, Facebook continued to insist that the Cambridge data collection was not a “data breach” because “everyone involved gave their consent” to share their data. The purported research app followed Facebook’s existing privacy rules, no systems were surreptitiously infiltrated and no one stole passwords or sensitive information without permission. (To Facebook, the only real violation was the transfer of information collected for “research” to a third party such as Cambridge.)","Experts say that argument only makes sense if every user fully understands Facebook’s obscure privacy settings, which often default to maximal data sharing.","“It’s a disgusting abuse of privacy,” said Larry Ponemon, founder of the privacy research firm Ponemon Institute. “In general, most of these privacy settings are superficial,” he said. “Companies need to do more to make sure commitments are actually met.”","Jeffrey Lang has joined Movie TV Tech Geeks for 2015 and will be providing his opinion on technology from across the pond in London.

{"originalurl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data","title":"NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others | US news | The Guardian","text":["The National Security Agency has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top secret document obtained by the Guardian.","The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called Prism, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says.","The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document, a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation – classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies – which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims \"collection directly from the servers\" of major US service providers.","Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies, all those who responded to a Guardian request for comment on Thursday denied knowledge of any such program.","In a statement, Google said: \"Google cares deeply about the security of our users' data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data.\"","Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of Prism or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. \"If they are doing this, they are doing it without our knowledge,\" one said.","The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012.","Prism Photograph: Guardian","The program facilitates extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US.","It also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the US being collected without warrants.","Disclosure of the Prism program follows a leak to the Guardian on Wednesday of a top-secret court order compelling telecoms provider Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of US customers.","The participation of the internet companies in Prism will add to the debate, ignited by the Verizon revelation, about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services. Unlike the collection of those call records, this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata.","Some of the world's largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the information-sharing program since its introduction in 2007. Microsoft – which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan \"Your privacy is our priority\" – was the first, with collection beginning in December 2007.","It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google, Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in 2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally Apple, which joined the program in 2012. The program is continuing to expand, with other providers due to come online.","Companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users' communications under US law, but the Prism program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies' servers. The NSA document notes the operations have \"assistance of communications providers in the US\".","The revelation also supports concerns raised by several US senators during the renewal of the Fisa Amendments Act in December 2012, who warned about the scale of surveillance the law might enable, and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces.","When the FAA was first enacted, defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA's inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies' servers.","A chart prepared by the NSA, contained within the top-secret document obtained by the Guardian, underscores the breadth of the data it is able to obtain: email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP (Skype, for example) chats, file transfers, social networking details, and more.","PRISM slide. Photograph: Guardian","The document is recent, dating to April 2013. Such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the NSA, which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy.","The Prism program allows the NSA, the world's largest surveillance organisation, to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders.","With this program, the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications as well as perform real-time collection on targeted users.","The presentation claims Prism was introduced to overcome what the NSA regarded as shortcomings of Fisa warrants in tracking suspected foreign terrorists. It noted that the US has a \"home-field advantage\" due to housing much of the internet's architecture. But the presentation claimed \"Fisa constraints restricted our home-field advantage\" because Fisa required individual warrants and confirmations that both the sender and receiver of a communication were outside the US.","\"Fisa was broken because it provided privacy protections to people who were not entitled to them,\" the presentation claimed. \"It took a Fisa court order to collect on foreigners overseas who were communicating with other foreigners overseas simply because the government was collecting off a wire in the United States. There were too many email accounts to be practical to seek Fisas for all.\"","The new measures introduced in the FAA redefines \"electronic surveillance\" to exclude anyone \"reasonably believed\" to be outside the USA – a technical change which reduces the bar to initiating surveillance.","The act also gives the director of national intelligence and the attorney general power to permit obtaining intelligence information, and indemnifies internet companies against any actions arising as a result of co-operating with authorities' requests.","In short, where previously the NSA needed individual authorisations, and confirmation that all parties were outside the USA, they now need only reasonable suspicion that one of the parties was outside the country at the time of the records were collected by the NSA.","The document also shows the FBI acts as an intermediary between other agencies and the tech companies, and stresses its reliance on the participation of US internet firms, claiming \"access is 100% dependent on ISP provisioning\".","In the document, the NSA hails the Prism program as \"one of the most valuable, unique and productive accesses for NSA\".","It boasts of what it calls \"strong growth\" in its use of the Prism program to obtain communications. The document highlights the number of obtained communications increased in 2012 by 248% for Skype – leading the notes to remark there was \"exponential growth in Skype reporting; looks like the word is getting out about our capability against Skype\". There was also a 131% increase in requests for Facebook data, and 63% for Google.","The NSA document indicates that it is planning to add Dropbox as a PRISM provider. The agency also seeks, in its words, to \"expand collection services from existing providers\".","The revelations echo fears raised on the Senate floor last year during the expedited debate on the renewal of the FAA powers which underpin the PRISM program, which occurred just days before the act expired.","Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware specifically warned that the secrecy surrounding the various surveillance programs meant there was no way to know if safeguards within the act were working.","\"The problem is: we here in the Senate and the citizens we represent don't know how well any of these safeguards actually work,\" he said.","\"The law doesn't forbid purely domestic information from being collected. We know that at least one Fisa court has ruled that the surveillance program violated the law. Why? Those who know can't say and average Americans can't know.\"","Other senators also raised concerns. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon attempted, without success, to find out any information on how many phone calls or emails had been intercepted under the program.","When the law was enacted, defenders of the FAA argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA's inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies' servers.","When the NSA reviews a communication it believes merits further investigation, it issues what it calls a \"report\". According to the NSA, \"over 2,000 Prism-based reports\" are now issued every month. There were 24,005 in 2012, a 27% increase on the previous year.","In total, more than 77,000 intelligence reports have cited the PRISM program.","Jameel Jaffer, director of the ACLU's Center for Democracy, that it was astonishing the NSA would even ask technology companies to grant direct access to user data.","\"It's shocking enough just that the NSA is asking companies to do this,\" he said. \"The NSA is part of the military. The military has been granted unprecedented access to civilian communications.","\"This is unprecedented militarisation of domestic communications infrastructure. That's profoundly troubling to anyone who is concerned about that separation.\"","A senior administration official said in a statement: \"The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person located within the United States.","\"The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-US persons outside the US are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about US persons.","\"This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debate.","\"Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.","\"The Government may only use Section 702 to acquire foreign intelligence information, which is specifically, and narrowly, defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This requirement applies across the board, regardless of the nationality of the target.\""],"isopubdate":"2013-06-07"}

The agency looked into the company’s practices several years ago and found them wanting. In 2011, Facebook entered into an agreement with the FTC that regulated how it treated its users privacy.","The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday said that it is officially investigating Facebook.","The FTC publicly confirmed the investigation after several news outlets reported on the probe last week, citing unnamed sources.","Facebook stock was down as much as 5% following news of the FTC probe.","Facebook has attracted the FTC’s scrutiny over the Cambridge Analytica (CA) scandal. CA is a political marketing firm that illicitly obtained data on up to 50 million Facebook users, unknown to those users, and used that data to influence voters towards Donald Trump in the US presidential election and the Brexit vote.","The problem for Facebook is that this isn’t the first time the FTC has investigated its privacy practices. The agency looked into the company’s practices several years ago and found them wanting. In 2011, Facebook entered into an agreement with the FTC that regulated how it treated its users’ privacy.","With this latest investigation, the FTC will be looking at two main factors: Did Facebook violate any FTC regulations with its dealings with Cambridge Analytica? And did the social media company violate its 2011 agreement with the FTC?","This is coming amidst increasing calls, even from powerful people in Silicon Valley, that Facebook, and perhaps other internet companies, need to be regulated. And in the meantime, more is being revealed about just how much data Facebook has quietly been collecting on its users, including new reports that it had tracked some Android users’ phone use.","Here’s the official statement confirming the FTC’s investigation. It references Privacy Shield, a framework between the US and Europe for how personal data must be treated by tech companies when it travels from one country to another.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers. Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”"],"isopubdate":""}

Why Does It Still Have a State Department Contract? - Defense One","text":["In February 2017, the State Department hired a company to help it reach people who might be susceptible to ISIS’s online recruiters. On Friday, Facebook blocked that company — Strategic Communications Laboratories, or SCL — for harvesting and sharing users’ data improperly. But as of press time, SCL still had a contract with State.","SCL used third-party apps to siphon users’ data and send it to Cambridge Analytica, the data-analysis firm that, in the words of The Guardian, “worked with Donald Trump’s election team and the winning Brexit campaign” to harvest “millions of Facebook profiles of US voters” and use them to build “a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.”","State’s “Global Engagement Center does have a contract with the Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) Group to provide research and analytical support in connection with our mission to counter terrorist propaganda and disinformation overseas,” a State Department spokesperson said. “SCL, in particular SCL Defence, has done work for other parts of the U.S. government in the past as well and is a major company in the field of research and analytics.”","Defense One reached out to representatives from SCL and Cambridge Analytica.

Among other things, the Center was intended to use data provided by users of social media platforms to craft highly targeted messages, use social networks to fight propaganda, in similar fashion as marketers use Facebook and Twitter to sell goods and services. The Center quickly turned to Facebook, according to Michael Lumpkin, the center’s founding director.","“Using Facebook ads, I can go within Facebook, I can go grab an audience, I can pick Country X, I need age group 13 to 34, I need people who have liked — whether it’s Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi or any other set — I can shoot and hit them directly with messaging,” Lumpkin said at the 2016 Defense One Summit.","A few weeks after Lumpkin stepped down in January 2017, SCL received a contract with the State Department for about $500,000. The website Govtribe lists the current status as “not completed” but specifies that the work was for FY 17. (Some additional context: the Center has been the subject of news reports showing mismanagement and employee turnover.)","SCL’s website claims that they offer “highly targeted” outreach to specific audiences via “channels such as social media; and indirect channels such as third-party endorsements and network affiliations. Every campaign is measured and evaluated: we execute a truly quantifiable approach to engagement, which ensures maximum efficiency of spending.”","Cambridge Analytica is best known as the data firm that helped the Trump campaign target specific U.S. voters to turn out for their candidate in the 2016 presidential race.

And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it.","“All kinds of people had access to the data,” said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica’s methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. “It was everywhere.”","Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said.","Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost.","The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013. He left the following year.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign. It denies any wrongdoing.","Cambridge Analytica’s acting CEO, Alexander Tayler, said in a statement that Wylie was a part-time contractor who “has no direct knowledge of our work or practices” since he left the company.","Wylie said he “absolutely” believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica’s databases for its work on the Brexit campaign. In the closely fought referendum in 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed Britain’s departure from the EU.","“I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,” Wylie said.","He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn’t want to relocate to Britain. The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a “department,” he said.","Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the “the next best thing” to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ, “a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,” Wylie said.","AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL.","“AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,” the company said. “All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.”","Wylie’s testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign.","They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds ($888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave, which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Rather than have one company that’s able to collect personally identifiable information from more than 2 billion users worldwide and manage how its accessed by third-parties, using a decentralized technology such as blockchain would put control back in the hands of individuals.","“Facebook just gave a gift to everybody that believes in decentralization,” says Jeremy Epstein, the CEO of Never Stop Marketing, a company that provides marketing for blockchain startups. “This is what happens when you give up control of your data.”","Also a faculty member of the Blockchain Research Institute, Epstein says a decentralized identity paradigm would allow users to renegotiate how their data is used and be able to prevent unwanted uses of it. Instead of a corporate entity like Facebook generating billions of dollars in revenues from ads sold from that user data, members of a decentralized network could share in the value equally.","A permissions-based model could ensure that the network not only knows who is in control of data, but what purposes it can be used for. Certain limits on how detailed the information is, how many times it can be accessed, or whether there’s a price to be paid for doing so could be set by the data owner.","“The data could only be presented in encrypted form and only decrypted by a smart contract that certifies that it’s only being used for academic purposes,” Epstein says.","For example, if academic research was conducted on a decentralized network, users could choose to opt-in, but strip all personally identifiable information from the data. So if the research required only to know if participants were older than 21, that would be a binary “true” or “false” value instead of a specific age.","At SecureKey, a Toronto-based firm collaborating with banks and telecom carriers to develop a nation-wide digital identity network, a different approach to managing user data is being taken. According to SecureKey CEO Greg Wolfond, a distributed ledger will be used to allow individuals to grant permissions for their data held by trusted service providers to be shared. For example, a home buyer could show a mortgage broker they qualify to make a down payment by sharing bank account details.","“Only I know where that’s going,” Wolfond says. “We make sure that it’s immutable and that it’s coming from a trusted source.”","It’s all about collecting specific consent from users any time data sharing is even considered, he says. Clear language would be used when asking for permission and when proof is collected, it’s hashed in a way that proves its authenticity.","“This is absolutely not the Facebook approach.”","Delvinia is a Toronto-based firm that operates data-collection firm AskingCanadians. Its research community of 1 million Canadians is routinely incented to participate in market research surveys in exchange for earning loyalty program points. It’s not using any distributed ledger technology today, says CEO Adam Froman, but still collects clear consent from its community members before sharing their data and also strips that data of any personally identifiable information.","The difference between Delvinia and Facebook is that Delvinia operates only in market research, while Facebook’s purpose is to enable personalized advertising, Froman says. While Facebook’s business model requires that its advertising engine can apply data to target ads, what happened in the case of Cambridge Analytica should never have been allowed.","“Maybe there was a bit of arrogance because of their scale,” he says. “The fact that there was the ability to do it is where Facebook has to accept responsibility. In a digital world, if you can, you will.”","The feature of the data-sharing API that allowed an academic researcher to collect information about 50 million Facebook users was deprecated in 2013. Previously, a user could grant a third-party app permission to see information about people on their friends’ list."],"isopubdate":""}

Cambridge Analytica, the data firm he worked with – which funded the project to turn tens of millions of Facebook profiles into a unique political weapon – also attracted interest from a key Russian firm with links to the Kremlin.","Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed “micro-targeting” individuals on social media during elections.","The revelations come at a time of intense US scrutiny of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, with 13 Russians criminally charged last month with interfering to help Donald Trump.","In Britain, concerns about Russian propaganda have been mounting, with the prime minister, Theresa May, recently attacking Russia for spreading fake news, accusing Moscow of attempts to “weaponise information” and influence polls.","Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, discussed with Cambridge Analytica the data company’s powerful social media marketing system, which was already being deployed for Republican Ted Cruz in the US presidential primaries and was later used to back Brexit and Trump.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, emailed colleagues after initial contacts to say that Lukoil wanted a clearer explanation of “how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business”.","“They understand behavioural micro-targeting in the context of elections (as per your excellent document/white paper) but they are failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers,” he wrote in an email seen by the Observer.","A slide presentation prepared for the Lukoil pitch focuses first on election disruption strategies used by Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, in Nigeria. They are presented under the heading “Election: Inoculation”, a military term used in “psychological operations” and disinformation campaigns. Other SCL documents show that the material shared with Lukoil included posters and videos apparently aimed at alarming or demoralising voters, including warnings of violence and fraud.","Discussion of services offered by Cambridge Analytica was apparently going right to the top of Lukoil, even though its retail operations in America are a very minor corner of the oil and gas giant’s empire. Asking for a detailed presentation of Cambridge Analyticas’s work in July 2014, Nix told his colleague the document would be “shared with the CEO of the business”.","The chief executive of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, is a former Soviet oil minister who has said the strategic aims of Lukoil are closely aligned with those of Russia. “I have only one task connected with politics, to help the country and the company. I’m not close to Mr Putin, but I treat him with great respect,” he told the New York Times.","Cambridge Analytica said an affiliate company had talked to Lukoil Turkey about a loyalty card scheme and proposed a pilot study with a small number of petrol stations there, but the project had not gone ahead. “[The talks] were about potential commercial work in Turkey and did not involve any discussion of political work,” a spokesman said. “Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate companies have not worked in Russia and have not worked for a Russian company or organisation.”","Last month Nix told MPs: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do no have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","That appears to contradict the company documents seen by the Observer, that list Russia as one of the countries where Cambridge Analytica and affiliate companies have clients.","Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who has come forward to talk to the Observer, said it was never entirely clear what the Russian firm hoped to get from the operation.","“Alexander Nix’s presentation didn’t make any sense to me,” said Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica soon after the initial meetings. “If this was a commercial deal, why were they so interested in our political targeting?”","Lukoil did not respond to requests for comments.","Kogan, a lecturer who worked with Cambridge Analytica on building up the database of US voters then at the heart of the company’s plans, said he had not had any connection to the Lukoil pitch.","But while he was helping turn Facebook profiles into a political tool he was also an associate professor at St Petersburg State University, taking Russian government grants to fund other research into social media. “Stress, health, and psychological wellbeing in social networks: cross-cultural investigation” was the title of one piece of research. Online posts showed Kogan lecturing in Russian. One talk was called: “New methods of communication as an effective political instrument”.","Cambridge University said academics are allowed to take on outside work but are expected to inform their head of institution, a rule Kogan had complied with. “We understand that Dr Kogan informed his head of department of discussions with St Petersburg University regarding a collaboration; it was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity,” a spokesman said.","Apart from that, Kogan appears to have largely kept the work private. Colleagues said they had not heard about the post in St Petersburg. “I am very surprised by that. No one knew,” one academic who asked not to be named told the Observer. Russia is not mentioned in a 10-page CV Kogan posted on a university website in 2015. The CV lists undergraduate prizes and grants of a few thousand dollars and links to dozens of media interviews.","One Cambridge Analytica employee mentioned Kogan’s Russian work in an email to Nix in March 2014 discussing a pitch to a Caribbean nation for a security contract, including “criminal psychographic profiling via intercepts”.","“We may want to either loop in or find out a bit more about the interesting work Alex Kogan has been doing for the Russians and see how/if it applies,” the colleague wrote.","Kogan told the Observer: “Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way. No data or models.” His recollection was that the Russia project had started a year after his collaboration with Cambridge Analytica ended.","He said the St Petersburg position emerged by chance on a social visit. A native Russian speaker, Kogan was born in Moldova and brought up in Moscow until he was seven, when his family emigrated to the US, where he later obtained citizenship.","However, he stayed in touch with family friends in Russia and visited regularly. On one trip, he said, he “dropped an email” to the psychology department at St Petersburg.","“We met, had a nice chat, and decided let’s try to collaborate – give me more reason to visit there,” he told the Observer in an email."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

She was responsible for maintaining a relationship with potential voters and she used Facebook to do it. However, it wasn’t just creating a page and attracting followers, Davidsen was given inside access because Facebook favored Obama which allowed the campaign to receive unprecedented data on millions of users.","“Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing,” wrote Davidsen.","Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.","To be clear, this was not some tool that everyone had.

But that is not at all what it was. It was all legal and available for anyone with a checkbook big enough to fund it.","As usual with tech and politics, bad reporting combined with weak technical literacy among politicians is confusing matters (though of course I’m all for Zuck being asked questions by Congress). As Facebook VP and general counsel Paul Grewal explained in a company blog post late Friday, this was not a data leak or breach. In fact, as has been previously reported a year ago by The Intercept’s Mattathias Schwartz, an academic researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan had developed a Facebook app that promised users a personality profile in exchange for their taking a quiz and allowing the app—like tens of thousands of other Facebook apps—to access private information from their profiles and that of their friends. To reach a large number, he paid American taskers on Mechanical Turk a $1 or $2 to download the app and take his survey, and from a seed group of nearly 300,000 was able to access personal data of what The Intercept said was 30 million American Facebook users. OK, so they were off by 20 million.","What this reveals is not some leak or breach, but rather the true purpose of Facebook’s existence—a tool of the corporate state to know everything about you, “legally.” As Snowden noted over the weekend, Facebook is a surveillance program simply disguised as “social media.”","Through a series of deceptive prompts, both the Obama and the Trump campaign waged data wars against Facebook users.","To do so, they were prompted to agree to grant the campaign permission to access their Facebook friends list, photos and other personal information.\nAnother prompt, which most people also agreed to, asked for them to grant access to their news feed.\nThrough these prompts, the campaign had access to millions of people, and their interests, and friends – who they could note down as potential donors, unregistered voters and persuadable votes – to target in specific campaigns.\nOne staffer said that once a supporter signed up through Facebook, it would take them mere seconds to go through their friends’ lists, match them with votes lists, and then they would go through photos – trying to weed out old girlfriends and college friends who could share their political beliefs.\nThe campaign reportedly mined data from 15 million Facebook users, which triggered alarms at the social media giant, but the company always decided that the campaign had not violated its privacy and data rules.","What’s more, it also reveals that both parties are so blinded by their pied pipers that they only care about this massive surveillance apparatus if “the other guy” is using it.","Even Davidsen noted this bipartisan exploitation of the masses, pointing out that Facebook definitely has friends on both sides.","“I am also 100% positive that Facebook activity recruits and staffs people that are on the other side,” she wrote.","I am also 100% positive that Facebook activity recruits and staffs people that are on the other side.","To those who’ve been following the Free Thought Project over the years, you’ll know that no matter what party is in power, the same insidious tactics are used against all Americans for the benefit of the establishment.","Also *ahem*.

That stolen data, according to reports, became the foundation for Cambridge Analytica’s efforts to target voters for Donald Trump’s 2016 Presidential campaign.","Cambridge Analytica’s goal, starting in 2013, was to use data modeling to influence voters based on their emotional makeup. Data scientist and former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie, speaking to The Guardian, described this as an effort to “target their inner demons.”","But the firm did not initially have access to the vast amount of data needed to achieve its goals.

Kogan and Wylie have been suspended from Facebook along with SCL and Cambridge Analytica.","In a statement sent to Fortune, Cambridge Analytica claimed it had contracted Kogan and his company, Global Science Research, to obtain data only in line with Facebook’s rules.","The event is being described as a data breach of the social media platform, though Facebook disputes that characterization, saying Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” before misusing it.","Facebook became aware of the activity by late 2015, and ordered the data destroyed by everyone Kogan had shared it with. According to Facebook, Cambridge Analytica claimed to have complied, but Facebook says it became aware this week that “not all data was deleted.” Cambridge Analytica claims it did delete the data according to Facebook’s request.","Facebook has not commented on why it did not publicly disclose the initial abuse. According to the Guardian, a Facebook official testified in hearings before British Parliament last month that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook user data.","The potential impact of the suspension on Trump’s reelection campaign is unclear. Cambridge Analytica will no longer be able to buy advertising on Facebook, but according to the Times, the organization still possesses “most or all” of the data it illicitly collected. That data, or systems trained using it, could still be used to direct campaign efforts by clients.","Update: This article has been updated to reflect a statement from Cambridge Analytica.","SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT","You May Like","Read More","Sign Up for Our Newsletters","Sign up now to receive FORTUNE's best content, special offers, and much more."],"isopubdate":""}

The Department of Homeland Security has identified the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas as a priority area for a border wall.CreditCreditMatthew Busch for The New York Times","WASHINGTON — The United States Army Corps of Engineers has begun preliminary preparations for the construction of segments of a wall in several places along the border with Mexico, the Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday.","Engineers are drilling and taking soil samples to determine what type of barriers would be most effective in the different types of geography along the border, said David Lapan, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.","The drilling and soil testing are taking place in El Paso; Santa Teresa, N.M.; Calexico, Calif.; and the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. Mr. Lapan said the testing has been completed in El Paso and Calexico. The agency has identified the San Diego area and the Rio Grande Valley as priority regions for new border walls. The Corps will begin work in the San Diego area in August.","The drilling and testing come as Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, continues to evaluate dozens of proposals that have been submitted by vendors for designs for a border wall.","President Trump mandated construction of the wall in an executive order in January. In March, the Department of Homeland Security put out a call for prototypes of a “physically imposing” and “aesthetically pleasing” border wall. The structure would also be designed to prevent climbing and tunneling.","The president’s plan to build a border wall was part of a contentious budget fight in Congress this year. The administration was seeking $3.6 billion in the 2017 and 2018 budgets for just over 100 miles of wall. But members of Congress — Democrats and Republicans — have so far declined to provide funding for the project and instead expanded funding to increase the use of technology such as sensors at the border.","On Tuesday, though, the House Appropriations Committee approved a spending bill that included $1.6 billion for a wall. The bill would fund 74 miles of fencing along the southwest border.","The Department of Homeland Security has moved $20 million from other programs to pay for the construction of several border wall prototypes. Construction of the prototypes for a border wall is set to begin this summer in the San Diego area.","Homeland Security officials said the prototypes would be added to the existing border walls in San Diego and would allow the agency to evaluate which barriers are most effective in giving Border Patrol agents time to respond to illegal drugs and human smuggling. Officials said they planned to build four to eight prototypes.","Mr. Trump initially spoke of building a “big, beautiful” wall along the entire 2,000-mile border with Mexico. But last week, he scaled back that plan, saying the length of the wall could be as little as 700 miles.","“You don’t need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers,” Mr. Trump said in a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One last week. “You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don’t really have people crossing. So you don’t need that. But you’ll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles.”","Mr. Trump also said the wall would be partially transparent and could have solar panels to help offset the cost. Mr. Trump has pledged that he would make Mexico pay for the wall, a notion flatly rejected by the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto.","Significant opposition to a wall has also developed in some communities along the border. In Texas, much of the land needed for a wall is private, and there is bipartisan opposition from most of the state’s congressional delegation.","Correction:","An article on Tuesday about drilling and soil samples being taken by the Army Corps of Engineers in preparation for building a border wall erroneously included one city among the locations where work is taking place. It has not yet begun in the San Diego area. (The Corps is scheduled to start work in August.)"],"isopubdate":"2282-10-07"}

NPR's Michel Martin speaks with former Facebook product manager Antonio Garcia Martinez.","MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:","Now to another explosive story that has potential implications for both politics and the law. Members of Congress are calling for an investigation into the data firm Cambridge Analytica after new reports from the New York Times and The Observer of London. According to these reports, the personal information belonging to some 50 million people was stolen and used to target them in ways they would not have seen and could not have known about. This according to a former insider named Christopher Wylie.","He says this information was used to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. election. Cambridge Analytica has ties to the Trump campaign. In 2016, the firm was hired to run the campaign's data operations, and Steve Bannon is a former vice president of the firm. Facebook says the data was obtained legally but misused afterward, but they've suspended Cambridge Analytica from their platform.","We wanted to understand how all this could have happened and what it might mean, so we've called Antonio Garcia Martinez. He is a Silicon Valley veteran and early Facebook employee who headed the company's targeting efforts, and he is now a contributor at Wired.","Antonio Garcia Martinez, thank you so much for speaking to us.","ANTIONIO GARCIA MARTINEZ: Thank you for having me.","MARTIN: Well, as a person who has worked closely with big data, could you just tell us your reaction to these reports?","MARTINEZ: Yeah. It's not totally surprising. I mean, the thing to keep clear here is that the data that's, kind of, leaked out isn't really, kind of, from the ad system but rather what's called platform-internally. And what that means is there are apps on Facebook, and, you know, you opt into these as a user, and that's, kind of, how this data breach happened. And it's really this weird thing where there is data coming out of one side of Facebook being used on the other, which is on - which is on the outside. But, you know, frankly, I wasn't hugely surprised. I mean, this is one of those things that it's been part of the platform for years now, and there's really not much Facebook can actually do about it is the hard truth about it.","MARTIN: You know, I was going to ask you about this because this is being described as a data breach, which says that the information was stolen, and that is the word that the Observer report uses. It says that the - this information was stolen or that Facebook basically left the door open and allowed this to happen and didn't put enough controls into place to keep this from happening. Now, Facebook says that they are investigating but that people did consent to give out their information, so this was not a data breach. How do you respond to that?","MARTINEZ: Yeah, no. I mean, how that term is typically used, this is not a data breach. That really gives the impression that there was some sort of security flaw and that Facebook somehow got hacked and literally everything from, you know, your messages to your partner to your, you know, childhood photos were potentially stolen, but that's not the case at all. You know, most of your listeners, probably, at some point, have opted into a Facebook app, and you do that even when, for example, you're using Facebook to log into a website or even on a mobile app. When you consent to a certain app accessing your Facebook data, that's kind of what you're opting into.","So this wasn't that somebody broke into Facebook and stole data. This is users who opted into an app, and then the data that that app got via this opt-in was misused in ways that are not in accordance with Facebook's data policy. So I mean, to the extent that we can sort of distinguish between what a breach implies, which is kind of a break in Facebook security law, and, you know, data exiting in a way that user consented to that was then, kind of, misused, it's definitely the latter situation right here.","MARTIN: So let me take this from another direction. One way to look at this is that the information may have allowed the Trump campaign to microtarget specific groups of voters, so how is this different from what all campaigns do these days? Or businesses for that matter? I mean, one of the key sources for this reporting, Christopher Wylie, was studying fashion trend forecasting, and he just applied the same kind of logic to this other enterprise. So is this different from what users could reasonably assume was being done with their data?","MARTINEZ: You know, that's a great question. I mean, the short answer is no. I mean, this is kind of a - a somewhat obscure field of advertising targeting called psychographics, and that's, kind of, the buzz word for it. And what it basically means is it tries to capture a person's psychological state, you know, down to things like openness or neuroticism, and these are words that, you know, were quoted from some of the leaked emails that the Guardian leaked out, right? So they try to profile a person according to a certain psychological dimension, and then understand how likely that person was to vote for or against some issue or candidate. Right? And what they were trying to get at was using Facebook to understand how, you know, neurotic, say, you were. And if that neuroticism, in their minds, would incline you to vote for or against somebody, they would try to target you as a result of that.","This isn't new. I mean, this sort of psychographic type stuff has been around even before the internet. It's been around for decades. It's also been on Facebook before. In the past, there have been other outside companies that have tried to psychologically profile users. What's strange is that it was - you know, that the data used to actually build these psychological models was kind of unethically arrived at. That, to me, is a critical issue. You know, the - how powerful this data was - I mean, to be honest, I think most ads professionals don't buy much into this whole psychographic thing.","MARTIN: So could you just drill down on something you just said, which was you said there was something unethical or potentially unethical about the way this - this information was arrived at or it was taken by the firm that eventually used it. So what was unethical about that?","MARTINEZ: Well, if the allegations are to be believed what happened was that Cambridge Analytica or, you know, their confederates and consultants paid test subjects to take a political poll, and in the course of taking that political poll, they had to opt in to a Facebook app as we often do when we log into other sites using Facebook, the difference being is that in this case, they took the results of those political polls - right? - their inclinations, their psychological profiles - and they joined that with all their Facebook data that they managed to suck out of Facebook via this Facebook app that the users had opted in to, not just those Facebook users but also their friends.","On Facebook's platform - not anymore but until not too long ago - if you opted into an app, that gave access, potentially, to the app to your friends data as well. And that's why the number of users whose information has been compromised is as high as it is - 50 million people. Cambridge Analytica didn't pay 50 million people take a poll. It paid of order tens of thousands, but each of those individuals had hundreds or thousands of friends, which is why the number is so large. And that's what's unethical about it. They basically paid people to take a poll, but then they basically hoovered out all of their Facebook data and joined it with that political data. That's the illegal bit.","MARTIN: That's Antonio Garcia Martinez. He's the former head of Facebook's effort to develop ad-targeting strategies. He's now a contributor to Wired.","Antonio Garcia Martinez, thank you so much for speaking with us.","MARTINEZ: It was great time. Thanks.","MARTIN: We should also mention that we reached out to Facebook for comment. They said they are, quote, \"conducting an internal and external review,\" unquote, to make sure the data no longer exists.","NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by Verb8tm, Inc., an NPR contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with NPR.

But the calls reflected mounting bipartisan concern in Washington over whether internet firms are operating as fair trustees of the massive amounts of user data they collect.

{"originalurl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/19/reddit-and-the-struggle-to-detoxify-the-internet","title":"Reddit and the Struggle to Detoxify the Internet | The New Yorker","text":["Which Web sites get the most traffic? According to the ranking service Alexa, the top three sites in the United States, as of this writing, are Google, YouTube, and Facebook. (Porn, somewhat hearteningly, doesn’t crack the top ten.) The rankings don’t reflect everything—the dark Web, the nouveau-riche recluses harvesting bitcoin—but, for the most part, people online go where you’d expect them to go. The only truly surprising entry, in fourth place, is Reddit, whose astronomical popularity seems at odds with the fact that many Americans have only vaguely heard of the site and have no real understanding of what it is. A link aggregator? A microblogging platform? A social network?","To its devotees, Reddit feels proudly untamed, one of the last Internet giants to resist homogeneity. Most Reddit pages have a throwback aesthetic, with a few crudely designed graphics and a tangle of text: an original post, comments on the post, responses to the comments, responses to the responses. That’s pretty much it. Reddit is made up of more than a million individual communities, or subreddits, some of which have three subscribers, some twenty million. Every subreddit is devoted to a specific kind of content, ranging from vital to trivial: r/News, r/Politics, r/Trees (for marijuana enthusiasts), r/MarijuanaEnthusiasts (for tree enthusiasts), r/MildlyInteresting (“for photos that are, you know, mildly interesting”). Some people end up on Reddit by accident, find it baffling, and never visit again. But people who do use it—redditors, as they’re called—often use it all day long, to the near-exclusion of anything else. “For a while, we called ourselves the front page of the Internet,” Steve Huffman, Reddit’s C.E.O., said recently. “These days, I tend to say that we’re a place for open and honest conversations—‘open and honest’ meaning authentic, meaning messy, meaning the best and worst and realest and weirdest parts of humanity.”","On November 23, 2016, shortly after President Trump’s election, Huffman was at his desk, in San Francisco, perusing the site. It was the day before Thanksgiving. Reddit’s administrators had just deleted a subreddit called r/Pizzagate, a forum for people who believed that high-ranking staffers of Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign, and possibly Clinton herself, were trafficking child sex slaves. The evidence, as extensive as it was unpersuasive, included satanic rituals, a map printed on a handkerchief, and an elaborate code involving the words “cheese” and “pizza.” In only fifteen days of existence, the Pizzagate subreddit had attracted twenty thousand subscribers. Now, in its place, was a scrubbed white page with the message “This community has been banned.”","The reason for the ban, according to Reddit’s administrators, was not the beliefs of people on the subreddit, but the way they’d behaved—specifically, their insistence on publishing their enemies’ private phone numbers and addresses, a clear violation of Reddit’s rules. The conspiracy theorists, in turn, claimed that they’d been banned because Reddit administrators were part of the conspiracy. (Less than two weeks after Pizzagate was banned, a man fired a semiautomatic rifle inside a D.C. pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong, in an attempt to “self-investigate” claims that the restaurant’s basement was a dungeon full of kidnapped children. Comet Ping Pong does not have a basement.)","Some of the conspiracy theorists left Reddit and reunited on Voat, a site made by and for the users that Reddit sloughs off. (Many social networks have such Bizarro networks, which brand themselves as strongholds of free speech and in practice are often used for hate speech. People banned from Twitter end up on Gab; people banned from Patreon end up on Hatreon.) Other Pizzagaters stayed and regrouped on r/The_Donald, a popular pro-Trump subreddit. Throughout the Presidential campaign, The_Donald was a hive of Trump boosterism. By this time, it had become a hermetic subculture, full of inside jokes and ugly rhetoric. The community’s most frequent commenters, like the man they’d helped propel to the Presidency, were experts at testing boundaries. Within minutes, they started to express their outrage that Pizzagate had been deleted.","Redditors are pseudonymous, and their pseudonyms are sometimes prefaced by “u,” for “username.” Huffman’s is Spez. As he scanned The_Donald, he noticed that hundreds of the most popular comments were about him:","“fuck u/spez”","“u/spez is complicit in the coverup”","“u/spez supports child rape”","One commenter simply wrote “u/SPEZ IS A CUCK,” in bold type, a hundred and ten times in a row.","Huffman, alone at his computer, wondered whether to respond. “I consider myself a troll at heart,” he said later. “Making people bristle, being a little outrageous in order to add some spice to life—I get that. I’ve done that.” Privately, Huffman imagined The_Donald as a misguided teen-ager who wouldn’t stop misbehaving. “If your little brother flicks your ear, maybe you ignore it,” he said. “If he flicks your ear a hundred times, or punches you, then maybe you give him a little smack to show you’re paying attention.”","Although redditors didn’t yet know it, Huffman could edit any part of the site. He wrote a script that would automatically replace his username with those of The_Donald’s most prominent members, directing the insults back at the insulters in real time: in one comment, “Fuck u/Spez” became “Fuck u/Trumpshaker”; in another, “Fuck u/Spez” became “Fuck u/MAGAdocious.”","The_Donald’s users saw what was happening, and they reacted by spinning a conspiracy theory that, in this case, turned out to be true.","“Manipulating the words of your users is fucked,” a commenter wrote.","“Even Facebook and Twitter haven’t stooped this low.”","“Trust nothing.”","The incident became known as Spezgiving, and it’s still invoked, internally and externally, as a paradigmatic example of tech-executive overreach. Social-media platforms must do something to rein in their users, the consensus goes, but not that.","Huffman can no longer edit the site indiscriminately, but his actions laid bare a fact that most social-media companies go to great lengths to conceal—that, no matter how neutral a platform may seem, there’s always a person behind the curtain. “I fucked up,” Huffman wrote in an apology the following week. “More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal.” Implicit in his apology was a set of questions, perhaps the central questions facing anyone who worries about the current state of civic discourse. Is it possible to facilitate a space for open dialogue without also facilitating hoaxes, harassment, and threats of violence? Where is the line between authenticity and toxicity? What if, after technology allows us to reveal our inner voices, what we learn is that many of us are authentically toxic?","The only way to understand the Internet, at least at first, was by metaphor. “Web” and “page” and “superhighway” are metaphors. So are “link,” “viral,” “post,” and “stream.” Last year, the Supreme Court heard a case about whether it was constitutional to bar registered sex offenders from using social media. In order to answer that question, the Justices had to ask another question: What is social media? In sixty minutes of oral argument, Facebook was compared to a park, a playground, an airport terminal, a polling place, and a town square.","It might be most helpful to compare a social network to a party. The party starts out small, with the hosts and a few of their friends. Then word gets out and strangers show up. People take cues from the environment. Mimosas in a sun-dappled atrium suggest one kind of mood; grain alcohol in a moldy basement suggests another. Sometimes, a pattern emerges on its own. Pinterest, a simple photo-sharing site founded by three men, happened to catch on among women aspiring to an urbane life style, and today the front page is often a collage of merino scarves and expensive glassware. In other cases, the gatekeeping seems more premeditated. If you’re fourteen, Snapchat’s user interface is intuitive; if you’re twenty-two, it’s intriguing; if you’re over thirty-five, it’s impenetrable. This encourages old people to self-deport.","Huffman and his college roommate, Alexis Ohanian, founded Reddit a few weeks after graduating from the University of Virginia, in 2005. The first people to show up were, like the co-founders, the kind of strong-headed young men who got excited about computer programming, video games, and edgy, self-referential humor. Reddit’s system was purely democratic, which is to say anarchic. Anyone could post any link, and the ones that got the most “upvotes” would rise to the top of a page. At the time, Facebook was available only to college students, and before joining it you had to provide your real name, your birthday, and a valid school e-mail address—the equivalent of being carded at the door. To join Reddit, all you needed was a username that hadn’t been claimed yet. You could start as many anonymous accounts as you wanted, which gave rise to creativity, and also to mischief.","Back then, Ohanian was ungainly and clean-shaven, and he was often photographed in a hoodie and with a goofy smile. At his wedding, last year, wearing a beard and an Armani tuxedo, he was nearly unrecognizable. (The paparazzi weren’t too interested in him, though, given that his bride was Serena Williams.) Huffman, on the other hand, has always looked more or less the same: bright-blue eyes, chipmunk teeth, and a thatch of blond hair.","A few months after Reddit launched, Huffman created the first constraints. People were posting links to vulgar and violent content—which was fine, except that Huffman wanted users to have some idea of what they were about to click on, so that they could avoid, say, inadvertently opening porn in front of their bosses. Huffman labelled some content N.S.F.W.—not safe for work—and separated it from everything else. That was the end of pure democracy.","In 2006, Ohanian and Huffman sold Reddit to Condé Nast, a media conglomerate that owns more than twenty magazines, including this one. (Reddit now operates independently.) The sale made them twenty-two-year-old millionaires, but they didn’t fit in at a large corporation, and three years later they left. In their absence, the party got bigger and weirder, and ominous cliques started to gather in the corners. One popular subreddit, r/Jailbait, was devoted to sexually suggestive photos of young-looking women. This was profoundly creepy, but probably not illegal—the subreddit’s users swore that all the women in the photos were eighteen or older—and Reddit allowed the community to grow. In September of 2011, Anderson Cooper discussed the subreddit on CNN. “It’s pretty amazing that a big corporation would have something like this, which reflects badly on it,” he said. Traffic to Jailbait quadrupled overnight. Twelve days later, after someone in the group apparently shared a nude photo of a fourteen-year-old girl, the community was banned. And yet the founder of Jailbait, an infamous troll who went by u/Violentacrez, was allowed to stay on Reddit, as were some four hundred other communities he’d created—r/Jewmerica, r/ChokeABitch, and worse. (Yes, it gets worse.)","Yishan Wong, an engineer who had worked at Facebook, was then Reddit’s C.E.O. He implied that he’d banned Jailbait only because the subreddit had violated U.S. law. “We stand for free speech,” he wrote in an internal post, in 2012. Reddit’s goal, he continued, was to “become a universal platform for human discourse.” Therefore, “it would not do if, in our youth, we decided to censor things simply because they were distasteful.”","At the time, Wong’s free-speech absolutism was ubiquitous in Silicon Valley. Twitter’s executives referred to their company as “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.” Facebook’s original self-description, “an online directory that connects people through social networks at colleges,” had evolved into a grandiose mission statement: “Facebook gives people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.” With the Arab Spring fresh in everyone’s mind, few questioned the assumption that “giving people the power” would inevitably lead to social progress. Barack Obama, who had been carried into office by a social-media groundswell, often expressed a similar optimism about the salubrious effects of the Internet. “In the twenty-first century, information is power,” Obama said in a 2011 speech on Middle East policy. “The truth cannot be hidden. . . . Such open discourse is important even if what is said does not square with our worldview.”","Wong left the company in 2014, after two and a half years. His successor was Ellen Pao, a former venture capitalist. She lasted eight months. Early in her tenure, Reddit announced a crackdown on involuntary pornography. If you found a compromising photo of yourself circulating on Reddit without your consent, you could report it and the company would remove it. In retrospect, this seems like a straightforward business decision, but some redditors treated it as the first in an inevitable parade of horrors. “This rule is stupid and suppresses our rights,” u/penisfuckermcgee commented.","A few months later, Reddit banned five of its most egregious communities, including r/FatPeopleHate and r/ShitNiggersSay. Again redditors were apoplectic (“We may as well take a one way ticket to North Korea”). Almost every day, strident misogynists called Pao a tyrant, an “Asian slut,” or worse. (Yes, it gets worse.) She resigned in July, 2015. “The Internet started as a bastion for free expression,” she wrote in the Washington Post. “But that balancing act is getting harder. The trolls are winning.”","Over time, social networks have turned into institutions. More than two billion people now use Facebook. In other words, the company has achieved its mission of making the world more connected. In 2016, that meant, among other things, making the American electorate more connected to white supremacists, armed militias, Macedonian fake-news merchants, and micro-targeted campaign ads purchased in rubles. “I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be President,” Obama said that year, despite the mounting aggression in some online forums. “And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people.” (In response to Obama’s remarks, a commenter on The_Donald wrote, “FUCK THAT LOW ENERGY CUCK!”)","Shortly after the election, Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign’s top digital strategist, told Wired, “Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing.” Reddit was also an important part of Trump’s strategy. Parscale wrote—on Reddit, naturally—that “members here provided considerable growth and reach to our campaign.” The_Donald, in particular, proved a fecund host cell for viral memes. On July 2, 2016, Trump tweeted a photo collage of Hillary Clinton, piles of cash, and the phrase “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!” written inside a six-pointed star. When Trump’s critics called attention to the image’s anti-Semitic implications, The_Donald’s users rushed to Trump’s defense, posting photos of other six-pointed stars in innocuous contexts. “Where is the outrage from the liberal left on this one?” a user wrote, beneath a photo of a “Frozen”-themed sticker book with a star on its cover. A few hours later, Trump tweeted the same photo, with a version of the same question, followed by “Dishonest media! #Frozen.”","During the campaign, Trump, or someone typing on his behalf, participated in Reddit’s signature interview format—an A.M.A., for “ask me anything.” In response to a question about the “protected class of media elites,” Trump wrote, “I have been very concerned about media bias and the total dishonesty of the press. I think new media is a great way to get out the truth.” This drew hundreds of jubilant comments (u/RAINBOW_DILDO: “daddy YES”; u/CantContheDon: “WE’RE THE MEDIA NOW”).","The_Donald, with more than half a million subscribers, is by far the biggest pro-Trump subreddit, but it ranks just below No. 150 on the list of all subreddits; it’s roughly the same size as r/CryptoCurrency and r/ComicBooks. “Some people on The_Donald are expressing their genuine political beliefs, and obviously that’s something we want to encourage,” Huffman said. “Others are maybe not expressing sincere beliefs, but are treating it more like a game—If I post this ridiculous or offensive thing, can I get people to upvote it? And then some people, to quote ‘The Dark Knight,’ just want to watch the world burn.” On some smaller far-right subreddits, the discourse is more unhinged. One, created in July of 2016, was called r/Physical_Removal. According to its “About Us” section, it was a subreddit for people who believe that liberals “qualify to get a helicopter ride.” “Helicopter ride,” an allusion to Augusto Pinochet’s reputed habit of throwing Communists out of helicopters, is alt-right slang for murder.","The_Donald accounts for less than one per cent of Reddit’s traffic, but it occupies far more than one per cent of the Reddit-wide conversation. Trolls set a cunning trap. By ignoring their provocations, you risk seeming complicit. By responding, you amplify their message. Trump, perhaps the world’s most skilled troll, can get attention whenever he wants, simply by being outrageous. Traditional journalists and editors can decide to resist the bait, and sometimes they do, but that option isn’t available on user-generated platforms. Social-media executives claim to transcend subjectivity, and they have designed their platforms to be feedback machines, giving us not what we claim to want, nor what might be good for us, but what we actually pay attention to.","There are no good solutions to this problem, and so tech executives tend to discuss it as seldom as possible, and only in the airiest of platitudes. Twitter has rebuffed repeated calls to ban President Trump’s account, despite his many apparent violations of company policy. (If tweeting that North Korea “won’t be around much longer” doesn’t break Twitter’s rule against “specific threats of violence,” it’s not clear what would.) Last fall, on his Facebook page, Mark Zuckerberg addressed—sort of, obliquely—the widespread critique that his company was exacerbating political polarization. “We’ll keep working to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, and to ensure our community is a platform for all ideas and force for good in democracy,” he wrote, then stepped away as a global howl of frustration grew in the comments.","I asked a few social-media executives to talk to me about all this. I didn’t expect definitive answers, I told them; I just wanted to hear them think through the questions. Unsurprisingly, no one jumped at the chance. Twitter mostly ignored my e-mails. Snapchat’s P.R. representatives had breakfast with me once, then ignored my e-mails. Facebook’s representatives talked to me for weeks, asking precise, intelligent questions, before they started to ignore my e-mails.","Reddit has more reason to be transparent. It’s big, but doesn’t feel indispensable to most Internet users or, for that matter, to most advertisers. Moreover, Anderson Cooper’s CNN segment was hardly the only bit of vividly terrible press that Reddit has received over the years. All social networks contain vitriol and bigotry, but not all social networks are equally associated with these things in the public imagination. Recently, I typed “Reddit is” into Google. Three of the top suggested auto-completions were “toxic,” “cancer,” and “hot garbage.”","Huffman, after leaving Condé Nast, spent a few months backpacking in Costa Rica, then founded a travel company called Hipmunk. In July, 2015, he returned to Reddit as C.E.O. In a post about his “top priority” in the job, he wrote, “The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them. . . . Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech.” This was shocking, and about half true. When free-speech absolutism was in vogue, Reddit’s co-founders were as susceptible to its appeal as anyone. In 2012, a Forbes reporter asked Ohanian how the Founding Fathers might have reacted to Reddit. “A bastion of free speech on the World Wide Web? I bet they would like it,” Ohanian responded. “I would love to imagine that ‘Common Sense’ would have been a self-post on Reddit, by Thomas Paine, or actually a redditor named T_Paine.”","Still, Ohanian and Huffman never took their own rhetoric too literally. The site’s rules were brief and vague, and their unwritten policy was even simpler. “We always banned people,” Huffman told me. “We just didn’t talk about it very much.” Because Reddit was so small, and misbehavior relatively rare, Huffman could do most of the banning himself, on an ad-hoc basis. “It wasn’t well thought out or even articulated, really. It was ‘That guy has the N-word in his username? Fuck that.’ Delete account.”","As C.E.O., Huffman continued the trend Pao had started, banning a few viciously racist subreddits such as r/Coontown. “There was pushback,” Huffman told me. “But I had the moral authority, as the founder, to take it in stride.” If Pao was like a forbearing parent, then Huffman’s style was closer to “I brought you into this world, and I can take you out of it.” “Yes, I know that it’s really hard to define hate speech, and I know that any way we define it has the potential to set a dangerous precedent,” he told me. “I also know that a community called Coontown is not good for Reddit.” In most cases, Reddit didn’t suspend individual users’ accounts, Huffman said: “We just took away the spaces where they liked to hang out, and went, ‘Let’s see if this helps.’ ”","Reddit’s headquarters, in a former radio tower in downtown San Francisco, look like a stereotypical startup office: high concrete ceilings, a large common area with beer and kombucha on tap. Each desk is decorated aggressively with personal flair—a “Make Reddit Great Again” hat, a glossy print magazine called Meme Insider. Working at Reddit requires paying close anthropological attention to the motley tastes of redditors, and it’s not uncommon to see groups of fit, well-dressed employees cheerfully discussing the most recent post on r/CatDimension or r/PeopleFuckingDying.","The first morning I visited the office, I ran into Huffman, who was wearing jeans, a T-shirt, and Adidas indoor-soccer shoes, as he tried to persuade an employee to buy a ticket to Burning Man. Huffman is far more unfiltered than other social-media executives, and every time he and I talked in the presence of Reddit’s head of P.R., he said at least one thing that made her wince. “There’s only one Steve,” Ohanian told me. “No matter when you catch him, for better or worse, that’s the Steve you’re gonna get.” I had a list of delicate topics that I planned to ask Huffman about eventually, including allegations of vote manipulation on Reddit’s front page and his personal feelings about Trump. Huffman raised all of them himself on the first day. “My political views might not be exactly what you’d predict,” he said. “I’m a gun owner, for example. And I don’t care all that much about politics, compared to other things.” He speaks in quick bursts, with an alpha-nerd combination of introversion and confidence. His opinion about Trump is that he is incompetent and that his Presidency has mostly been a failure. But, he told me, “I’m open to counterarguments.”","That afternoon, I watched Huffman make a sales pitch to a group of executives from a New York advertising agency. Like many platforms, Reddit has struggled to convert its huge audience into a stable revenue stream, and its representatives spend a lot of time trying to convince potential advertisers that Reddit is not hot garbage. Huffman sat at the head of a long table, facing a dozen men and women in suits. The “snarky, libertarian” ethos of early Reddit, he said, “mostly came from me as a twenty-one-year-old. I’ve since grown out of that, to the relief of everyone.” The executives nodded and chuckled. “We had a lot of baggage,” he continued. “We let the story get away from us. And now we’re trying to get our shit together.”","Later, Huffman told me that getting Reddit’s shit together would require continual intervention. “I don’t think I’m going to leave the office one Friday and go, ‘Mission accomplished—we fixed the Internet,’ ” he said. “Every day, you keep visiting different parts of the site, opening this random door or that random door—‘What’s it like in here? Does this feel like a shitty place to be? No, people are generally having a good time, nobody’s hatching any evil plots, nobody’s crying. O.K., great.’ And you move on to the next room.”","In January, Facebook announced that it would make news less visible in its users’ feeds. “Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family—and it has excelled at that,” a product manager named Samidh Chakrabarti wrote on a company blog. “But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it’s being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.” It wasn’t the most effusive mea culpa in history, but by Facebook’s standards it amounted to wailing and gnashing of teeth. “We want to make sure that our products are not just fun, but are good for people,” Mark Zuckerberg told the Times. Direct pronouncements from him are so rare that even this pabulum was treated as push-alert-worthy news.","In retrospect, although Facebook denies this, it seems clear that the company was preparing for a blow that was about to land. On February 16th, the special counsel Robert Mueller filed an indictment against several Russian individuals and businesses, including the Internet Research Agency, a company aligned with the Kremlin. The indictment mentioned Facebook thirty-five times, and not in ways that made the platform seem like a “force for good in democracy.” According to recent reporting by the Daily Beast, the Internet Research Agency also seeded Reddit with disinformation during the 2016 election. (A group of impostors even tried to set up an A.M.A.) Last Monday, the Washington Postreported that the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Reddit executives about this; the same day, Huffman admitted that the company had “found and removed a few hundred accounts” associated with Russian propaganda. (A Reddit representative told me that the company has been coöperating with congressional investigators “for months,” although they haven’t spoken about it publicly.) As in all such disinformation campaigns, the Russians did not act alone: their messages were upvoted and repeated by thousands of unsuspecting Americans. “I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense,” Huffman wrote. “I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it’s not that easy.”","Zuckerberg recently set a “personal challenge” for himself: “enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools.” This seems to be a reversal for Zuckerberg, who was once a fake-news truther. Two days after the 2016 election, he said, “The idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea. Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.” This was a pretty crazy idea, and Zuckerberg has been walking it back ever since. It’s obvious that what we see online affects how we think and feel. We know this in part because Facebook has done research on it. In 2012, without notice or permission, Facebook tweaked the feeds of nearly seven hundred thousand of its users, showing one group more posts containing “positive emotional content” and the other more “negative emotional content.” Two years later, Facebook declassified the experiment and published the results. Users were livid, and, after that, Facebook either stopped conducting secret experiments or stopped admitting to them. But the results of the experiment were clear: the people with happier feeds acted happier, and vice versa. The study’s authors called it “massive-scale emotional contagion.” Since then, social media has only grown in size and influence, and the persuasive tools available to advertisers, spies, politicians, and propagandists have only become sharper. During the 2016 election, a few Russian impostors affected many Americans’ beliefs and, presumably, votes. With another election coming up, most of the loopholes that the Russians exploited have not been closed, and the main loophole—the open, connected, massively contagious world of social media—might not be closable.","When I raised this issue with Huffman over dinner last summer, he said, “I go back and forth on whether Reddit is the tail or the dog. I think it’s a bit of both.” First, he laid out the tail hypothesis: “Reddit is a reflection of reality. People are enthusiastic about Bernie or Trump in real life, so they go on Reddit and talk about how much they like Bernie or Trump. So far, so good.” Then he laid out the dog hypothesis, which his fellow social-media executives almost never acknowledge—that reality is also a reflection of social media. “All sorts of weird things can happen online,” he said. “Imagine I post a joke where the point is to be offensive—like, to imply, ‘This is something that a racist person would say’—but you misread the context and think, ‘Yeah, that racist guy has a good point.’ That kind of dynamic, I think, explains a lot of what happened on The_Donald, at least in the early days—someone keeps pushing a joke or a meme to see how far they can take it, and the answer turns out to be Pretty fucking far.”","Leftist communities on Reddit often implore the company to ban The_Donald. So far, Huffman has demurred. “There are arguments on both sides,” he said, “but, ultimately, my view is that their anger comes from feeling like they don’t have a voice, so it won’t solve anything if I take away their voice.” He thought of something else to say, but decided against it. Then he took a swig of beer and said it anyway. “I’m confident that Reddit could sway elections,” he told me. “We wouldn’t do it, of course. And I don’t know how many times we could get away with it. But, if we really wanted to, I’m sure Reddit could have swayed at least this election, this once.” That’s a terrifying thought. It’s also almost certainly true.","On August 11th, Huffman’s alma mater, the University of Virginia, was overrun by white nationalists carrying torches. “I was on a plane when I saw the news, and I got really emotional,” Huffman said. He told his employees, “If any of these people are on Reddit, I want them gone. Nuke ’em.” This felt cathartic, but personal catharsis is an awful way to make policy. “Luckily, my team knew me well enough to go, ‘Steve, you’re pissed off right now. Let’s talk about it more rationally on Monday.’ ”","Early the next week, Reddit banned Physical_Removal. In Charlottesville, James Alex Fields, one of the white nationalists, had driven a car into a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring nineteen and killing a woman named Heather Heyer. “This is a good thing,” the top post on Physical_Removal read. “They are mockeries of life and need to fucking go.” Reddit had a rule prohibiting content that “encourages or incites violence,” and this was a violation of that rule. Huffman said, “We’d had our eye on that community for a while, and it felt good to get rid of them, I have to say. But it still didn’t feel like enough.”","“Encouraging or inciting violence” was a narrow standard, and Huffman and his team agreed to expand it. Four words became thirty-six: “Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise, do not post content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals.” This, too, required interpretation, and forced the company to create a non-exhaustive list of exceptions (“educational, newsworthy, artistic, satire, documentary”). Still, it made the team’s intentions clearer. Jessica Ashooh, Reddit’s head of policy, spent four years as a policy consultant in Abu Dhabi. “I know what it’s like to live under censorship,” she said. “My internal check, when I’m arguing for a restrictive policy on the site, is Do I sound like an Arab government? If so, maybe I should scale it back.” On the other hand, she said, “people hide behind the notion that there’s a bright line between ideology and action, but some ideologies are inherently more violent than others.”","In October, on the morning the new policy was rolled out, Ashooh sat at a long conference table with a dozen other employees. Before each of them was a laptop, a mug of coffee, and a few hours’ worth of snacks. “Welcome to the Policy Update War Room,” she said. “And, yes, I’m aware of the irony of calling it a war room when the point is to make Reddit less violent, but it’s too late to change the name.” The job of policing Reddit’s most pernicious content falls primarily to three groups of employees—the community team, the trust-and-safety team, and the anti-evil team—which are sometimes described, respectively, as good cop, bad cop, and RoboCop. Community stays in touch with a cross-section of redditors, asking them for feedback and encouraging them to be on their best behavior. When this fails and redditors break the rules, trust and safety punishes them. Anti-evil, a team of back-end engineers, makes software that flags dodgy-looking content and sends that content to humans, who decide what to do about it.","Ashooh went over the plan for the day. All at once, they would replace the old policy with the new policy, post an announcement explaining the new policy, warn a batch of subreddits that they were probably in violation of the new policy, and ban another batch of subreddits that were flagrantly, irredeemably in violation. I glanced at a spreadsheet with a list of the hundred and nine subreddits that were about to be banned (r/KKK, r/KillAllJews, r/KilltheJews, r/KilltheJoos), followed by the name of the employee who would carry out each deletion, and, if applicable, the reason for the ban (“mostly just swastikas?”). “Today we’re focussing on a lot of Nazi stuff and bestiality stuff,” Ashooh said. “Context matters, of course, and you shouldn’t get in trouble for posting a swastika if it’s a historical photo from the 1936 Olympics, or if you’re using it as a Hindu symbol. But, even so, there’s a lot that’s clear-cut.” I asked whether the same logic—that the Nazi flag was an inherently violent symbol—would apply to the Confederate flag, or the Soviet flag, or the flag under which King Richard fought the Crusades. “We can have those conversations in the future,” Ashooh said. “But we have to start somewhere.”","At 10 a.m., the trust-and-safety team posted the announcement and began the purge. “Thank you for letting me do DylannRoofInnocent,” one employee said. “That was one of the ones I really wanted.”","“What is ReallyWackyTicTacs?” another employee asked, looking down the list.","“Trust me, you don’t want to know,” Ashooh said. “That was the most unpleasant shit I’ve ever seen, and I’ve spent a lot of time looking into Syrian war crimes.”","Some of the comments on the announcement were cynical. “They don’t actually want to change anything,” one redditor wrote, arguing that the bans were meant to appease advertisers. “It was, in fact, never about free speech, it was about money.” One trust-and-safety manager, a young woman wearing a leather jacket and a ship captain’s cap, was in charge of monitoring the comments and responding to the most relevant ones. “Everyone seems to be taking it pretty well so far,” she said. “There’s one guy, freespeechwarrior, who seems very pissed, but I guess that makes sense, given his username.”","“People are making lists of all the Nazi subs getting banned, but nobody has noticed that we’re banning bestiality ones at the same time,” Ashooh said.","“No one wants to admit it,” an employee said. “ ‘Guys, I was just browsing r/HorseCock and I couldn’t help but notice . . .’ ”","The woman in the captain’s cap said, “O.K., someone just asked, ‘How will the exact phrase “kill yourself” be handled?’ ”","“It all depends on context,” Ashooh said. “They’re going to get tired of hearing that, but it’s true.”","“Uh-oh, looks like we missed a bestiality sub,” the woman in the captain’s cap said. “Apparently, SexWithDogs was on our list, but DogSex was not.”","“Did you go to DogSex?” Ashooh said.","“Yep.”","“And what’s on it?”","“I mean . . .”","“Are there people having sex with dogs?”","“Oh, yes, very much.”","“Yeah, ban it.”","“I’m going to get more cheese sticks,” the woman in the captain’s cap said, standing up. “How many cheese sticks is too many in one day? At what point am I encouraging or glorifying violence against my own body?”","“It all depends on context,” Ashooh said.","I understood why other companies had been reluctant to let me see something like this. Never again would I be able to read a lofty phrase about a social-media company’s shift in policy—“open and connected,” or “encouraging meaningful interactions”—without imagining a group of people sitting around a conference room, eating free snacks and making fallible decisions. Social networks, no matter how big they get or how familiar they seem, are not ineluctable forces but experimental technologies built by human beings. We can tell ourselves that these human beings aren’t gatekeepers, or that they have cleansed themselves of all bias and emotion, but this would have no relation to reality. “I have biases, like everyone else,” Huffman told me once. “I just work really hard to make sure that they don’t prevent me from doing what’s right.”","In a perfect world, a thirty-four-year-old in soccer shoes wouldn’t have such fearsome power. In the world we live in, the least social-media executives can do is acknowledge that power. Last November, a group of computer scientists at three universities published a study called “You Can’t Stay Here: The Efficacy of Reddit’s 2015 Ban Examined Through Hate Speech.” They parsed a data set of a hundred million Reddit posts. Did the ban “diminish hateful behavior” over all, or did it merely “relocate such behavior to different parts of the site”? They concluded that the ban had worked: “Users participating in the banned subreddits either left the site or (for those who remained) dramatically reduced their hate speech usage.”","Melissa Tidwell, Reddit’s general counsel, told me, “I am so tired of people who repeat the mantra ‘Free speech!’ but then have nothing else to say. Look, free speech is obviously a great ideal to strive toward. Who doesn’t love freedom? Who doesn’t love speech? But then, in practice, every day, gray areas come up.” Earlier that day, I’d watched Tidwell and a colleague spend several minutes debating whether a soft-core porn subreddit, r/GentlemenBoners, should be included in standard search results.","“Does free speech mean literally anyone can say anything at any time?” Tidwell continued. “Or is it actually more conducive to the free exchange of ideas if we create a platform where women and people of color can say what they want without thousands of people screaming, ‘Fuck you, light yourself on fire, I know where you live’? If your entire answer to that very difficult question is ‘Free speech,’ then, I’m sorry, that tells me that you’re not really paying attention.”","It has become a tradition for tech companies to release elaborate, self-referential jokes every April Fools’ Day. The point is to generate some free publicity that will make the company seem quirky and relatable, but it can also have the opposite effect, especially when the premise of the joke is Silicon Valley’s unprecedented power. A few years ago, Twitter announced that it would start charging for vowels. Last year, Google shared a mockup of its new data center on Mars, and Amazon revealed voice-recognition software that would take commands from pets. The companies hadn’t actually initiated any of these projects, but they probably could, one day, if they wanted to. Get it?","Last April Fools’, instead of a parody announcement, Reddit unveiled a genuine social experiment. It was called r/Place, and it was a blank square, a thousand pixels by a thousand pixels. In the beginning, all million pixels were white. Once the experiment started, anyone could change a single pixel, anywhere on the grid, to one of sixteen colors. The only restriction was speed: the algorithm allowed each redditor to alter just one pixel every five minutes. “That way, no one person can take over—it’s too slow,” Josh Wardle, the Reddit product manager in charge of Place, explained. “In order to do anything at scale, they’re gonna have to coöperate.”","Place had been active for about twenty minutes when I stopped by, and Wardle was huddled over his laptop, frantically refreshing dozens of tabs. So far, the square was mostly blank, with a few stray dots blinking in and out of existence. But redditors were making plans in the comments and, in true Reddit fashion, clinging to those plans with cultish intensity. The Blue Empire was conspiring to turn the whole square blue; the Red Empire vowed to make it red; already, they were on a war footing. Other groups planned elaborate messages, fractal patterns, and references to various memes. A multi-partisan group—leftists, Trump supporters, patriotic libertarians, and pre-political teen-agers—decided to draw an American flag in the center of the square. They congregated at r/AmericanFlagInPlace, where they hashed out the exact dimensions, the shapes of the stars and stripes, and strategies for repelling invaders. Meanwhile, a group of nihilists at r/BlackVoid prepared to blot out whatever the other groups created.","Wardle went to great lengths to show me that Place was a pure democracy—the algorithm was designed so that, once it went live, all he could do was watch, along with everyone else. Now that he was watching, he seemed deeply nervous. “The idea was ‘Let’s put up a very simple microcosm of the Internet and just see what happens,’ ” he said. “Reddit itself is not the most complex idea. It’s sort of a blank canvas. The community takes that and does all sorts of creative things with it.”","“And some terrible things,” I said.","The idea behind r/Place was to put up a very simple microcosm of the Internet and see what happens.","He paused. “I’m pretty confident,” he said. “I’d be lying if I said I was a hundred per cent confident.” Already, one of the top comments on Place read, “I give this an hour until swastikas.” Later, one of Wardle’s colleagues told me, “That was what kept Josh up at night. Before this went live, he was literally calculating, ‘O.K., it takes a minimum of seventeen pixels to make a swastika—what if we open this up to the world, and the headline the next day is “Reddit: A Place to Draw Swastikas on the Internet”?’ ”","The upper-left corner was a choppy, flickering purple, as the Blue Empire and the Red Empire battled for dominance. A graffiti artist, or artists, wrote, “9/11 was an inside job”; a few minutes later, the “was” turned into “wasn’t,” and the “an” became “anime.” Elsewhere, “Dick butt” became “Dick butter,” then “Dick buffet.” And then the swastikas appeared—just a few of them, but enough to make Wardle raise the hood of his sweatshirt, retreat into an empty conference room, and shut the door, looking pallid.","In his office, Huffman met with Chris Slowe, Reddit’s first employee, who is now the chief technical officer.","“How is Place going?” Huffman asked.","“Pretty much as expected,” Slowe said. “A lot of memes, some Pokémon, and a barrage of dicks.”","“If there’s ever a Reddit musical, that wouldn’t be a bad title,” Huffman said. “Maybe I should write a memoir called ‘A Barrage of Dicks.’ ”","“I have faith in our people,” Slowe said.","Lunch was served: a shrimp-and-lentil salad and a vegan bean fricassee. People stood in the common area, holding paper plates, watching a live feed of Place on a wall-mounted TV.","One employee, reading the comments, said, “A bunch of people are finding swastikas and then telling everyone else where they are, so that people can go get rid of them.”","“I just saw it!” another said. He pointed to a section of the screen. As we watched, one swastika was erased and another was modified to become a Windows 95 logo. Eventually, the swastika-makers got bored and moved on.","At one point, the American flag caught on fire; the fire was stamped out, and the Reddit employees cheered.","“Feels like watching a football game in extreme slow motion,” one said.","“Or like watching the election results.”","“Oh, God, don’t say that.”","Toward the end, the square was a dense, colorful tapestry, chaotic and strangely captivating. It was a collage of hundreds of incongruous images: logos of colleges, sports teams, bands, and video-game companies; a transcribed monologue from “Star Wars”; likenesses of He-Man, David Bowie, the “Mona Lisa,” and a former Prime Minister of Finland. In the final hours, shortly before the experiment ended and the image was frozen for posterity, BlackVoid launched a surprise attack on the American flag. A dark fissure tore at the bottom of the flag, then overtook the whole thing. For a few minutes, the center was engulfed in darkness. Then a broad coalition rallied to beat back the Void; the stars and stripes regained their form, and, in the end, the flag was still there.","The final image contained no visible hate symbols, no violent threats, not even much nudity. Late in the day, Wardle emerged from hiding, poured himself a drink, and pushed back his hood. “It’s possible that I will be able to sleep tonight,” he said. ♦","This article appears in the print edition of the March 19, 2018, issue, with the headline “Antisocial Media.”","Andrew Marantz, a contributing editor, has written for The New Yorker since 2011."],"isopubdate":""}

Following the news first published by the Guardian and New York Times, a lot of media attention over the past two weeks has focused on the Cambridge Analytica case as well as on what it reveals about Facebook and its users. Airi Lampinen at Stockholm University discusses the case on Swedish Radio.","Airi Lampinen at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University.","- This case is a good example of why we need to consider privacy beyond individuals. The actions we take online have implications not only for ourselves but also for other people in our social networks\", explains Airi Lampinen, Senior Lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction at Stockholm University.","Airi Lampinen, who has studied privacy on social media extensively, also points out that the case brings up concerns that privacy scholars have been trying to bring into the public's awareness for years. In 2011, Lampinen co-authored a study on third-party applications on Facebook and users' understandings of them.","At the time of the study, about half of the respondents did not know that apps could access and store their profile data off of Facebook’s site, or that when they added an app, it could also access the basic profile data of anyone on their friend's list.","Further, over 90 percent of the respondents were somewhat or very uncomfortable with the possibility that an app could sell their profile information, store their information permanently on its servers, or share that data with other companies."],"isopubdate":""}
{"originalurl":"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/cambridge-analytica-facebook-quiz.html","title":"Opinion | Cambridge Analytica and the Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz - The New York Times","text":["Cambridge Analytica and the Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz","Do you panic easily? Do you often feel blue? Do you have a sharp tongue? Do you get chores done right away? Do you believe in the importance of art?","If ever you’ve answered questions like these on one of the free personality quizzes floating around Facebook, you’ll have learned what’s known as your Ocean score: How you rate according to the big five psychological traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. You may also be responsible the next time America is shocked by an election upset.","For several years, a data firm eventually hired by the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica, has been using Facebook as a tool to build psychological profiles that represent some 230 million adult Americans. A spinoff of a British consulting company and sometime-defense contractor known for its counterterrorism “psy ops” work in Afghanistan, the firm does so by seeding the social network with personality quizzes. Respondents — by now hundreds of thousands of us, mostly female and mostly young but enough male and older for the firm to make inferences about others with similar behaviors and demographics — get a free look at their Ocean scores. Cambridge Analytica also gets a look at their scores and, thanks to Facebook, gains access to their profiles and real names.","Cambridge Analytica worked on the “Leave” side of the Brexit campaign. In the United States it takes only Republicans as clients: Senator Ted Cruz in the primaries, Mr. Trump in the general election. Cambridge is reportedly backed by Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire and a major Republican donor; a key board member is Stephen K. Bannon, the head of Breitbart News who became Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman and is set to be his chief strategist in the White House.","In the age of Facebook, it has become far easier for campaigners or marketers to combine our online personas with our offline selves, a process that was once controversial but is now so commonplace that there’s a term for it, “onboarding.” Cambridge Analytica says it has as many as 3,000 to 5,000 data points on each of us, be it voting histories or full-spectrum demographics — age, income, debt, hobbies, criminal histories, purchase histories, religious leanings, health concerns, gun ownership, car ownership, homeownership — from consumer-data giants.","No data point is very informative on its own, but profiling voters, says Cambridge Analytica, is like baking a cake. “It’s the sum of the ingredients,” its chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, told NBC News. Because the United States lacks European-style restrictions on second- or thirdhand use of our data, and because our freedom-of-information laws give data brokers broad access to the intimate records kept by local and state governments, our lives are open books even without social media or personality quizzes.","Ever since the advertising executive Lester Wunderman coined the term “direct marketing” in 1961, the ability to target specific consumers with ads — rather than blanketing the airwaves with mass appeals and hoping the right people will hear them — has been the marketer’s holy grail. What’s new is the efficiency with which individually tailored digital ads can be tested and matched to our personalities. Facebook is the microtargeter’s ultimate weapon.","The explosive growth of Facebook’s ad business has been overshadowed by its increasing role in how we get our news, real or fake. In July, the social network posted record earnings: quarterly sales were up 59 percent from the previous year, and profits almost tripled to $2.06 billion. While active users of Facebook — now 1.71 billion monthly active users — were up 15 percent, the real story was how much each individual user was worth. The company makes $3.82 a year from each global user, up from $2.76 a year ago, and an average of $14.34 per user in the United States, up from $9.30 a year ago. Much of this growth comes from the fact that advertisers not only have an enormous audience in Facebook but an audience they can slice into the tranches they hope to reach.","One recent advertising product on Facebook is the so-called “dark post”: A newsfeed message seen by no one aside from the users being targeted. With the help of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Trump’s digital team used dark posts to serve different ads to different potential voters, aiming to push the exact right buttons for the exact right people at the exact right times.","Imagine the full capability of this kind of “psychographic” advertising. In future Republican campaigns, a pro-gun voter whose Ocean score ranks him high on neuroticism could see storm clouds and a threat: The Democrat wants to take his guns away. A separate pro-gun voter deemed agreeable and introverted might see an ad emphasizing tradition and community values, a father and son hunting together.","In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote. According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign sent ads reminding certain selected black voters of Hillary Clinton’s infamous “super predator” line. It targeted Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood with messages about the Clinton Foundation’s troubles in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Federal Election Commission rules are unclear when it comes to Facebook posts, but even if they do apply and the facts are skewed and the dog whistles loud, the already weakening power of social opprobrium is gone when no one else sees the ad you see — and no one else sees “I’m Donald Trump, and I approved this message.”","While Hillary Clinton spent more than $140 million on television spots, old-media experts scoffed at Trump’s lack of old-media ad buys. Instead, his campaign pumped its money into digital, especially Facebook. One day in August, it flooded the social network with 100,000 ad variations, so-called A/B testing on a biblical scale, surely more ads than could easily be vetted by human eyes for compliance with Facebook’s “community standards.”","Perhaps out of necessity, the Trump team was embracing a new-media lesson: It didn’t have to build everything from scratch. Mark Zuckerberg and others had already built the infrastructure the campaign needed to reach voters directly. When “Trump TV” went live on Facebook before and after the second debate it raked in $9 million in donations in 120 minutes.","In the immediate wake of Mr. Trump’s surprise election, so many polls and experts were so wrong that it became fashionable to declare that big data was dead. But it isn’t, not when its most obvious avatar, Facebook, was so crucial to victory.","On Monday, after a similar announcement from Google, Facebook said it would no longer allow fake-news websites to show ads, on their own sites, from Facebook’s ad network — a half-step that neither blocks what appears on your newsfeed nor affects how advertisers can microtarget users on the social network.","There are surely more changes to come. Mr. Zuckerberg is young, still skeptical that his radiant transparency machine could be anything but a force for good, rightly wary of policing what the world’s diverse citizens say and share on his network, so far mostly dismissive of Facebook’s role in the election. If Mr. Zuckerberg takes seriously his oft-stated commitments to diversity and openness, he must grapple honestly with the fact that Facebook is no longer just a social network. It’s an advertising medium that’s now dangerously easy to weaponize.","A Trump administration is unlikely to enforce transparency about who is targeted by dark posts and other hidden political ads — or to ensure that politicians take meaningful ownership of what the ads say. But Facebook can.","McKenzie Funk, an Open Society fellow, is a founding member of the journalism cooperative Deca and the author of “Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR5 of the New York edition with the headline: The Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz.

The stake allows Sberbank to veto sales in excess of 25 percent of Yandex shares to an individual buyer.","Preparing its potential investors for the possible risks and giving them a brief outline of the current political situation, Yandex stated in the prospectus, “High-profile businesses in Russia, such as ours, can be particularly vulnerable to politically motivated actions.”","“Other parties” may also perceive Yandex’s news service “as reflecting a political viewpoint or agenda, which could subject us to politically motivated actions,” the document said.","The company also acknowledged the risk of a takeover by oligarchs.","“Well-funded, well-connected financial groups and so-called ‘oligarchs’ have, from time to time, sought to obtain operational control … in attractive businesses in Russia by means that have been perceived as relying on economic or political influence or government connections,” the Yandex prospectus said.","Yandex declined to comment on who among Russian billionaires could pose a potential threat to the company.","In 2008, the company fended off an attempt by billionaire Alisher Usmanov, co-owner of Metalloinvest, to acquire a 10 percent stake.","Usmanov is now considered one of the most savvy Russian investors in Internet companies and owns a significant share in Mail.ru Group, which went public in November last year on the London Stock Exchange and raised $912 million.","Yandex filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission late last week and will float by May 23 on Nasdaq.","The price range of the floated shares will be officially announced by Victory Day, May 9, according to sources close to the IPO, Reuters reported. Yandex, whose value is estimated to be between $6 billion and $9 billion, is planning to sell between 10 percent to 20 percent of its shares and raise about $1 billion.","Some analysts dismissed the significance of the Yandex comments in the prospectus, saying that companies always list potential risks when going public.","“Even aliens could be put on the risks list,” said Konstantin Chernyshyov, an analyst at UralSib.","But others pointed out that the risk of oligarch takeover and state meddling were not mentioned in the prospectus by Mail.ru Group — whose stock price plummeted nearly 20 percent late last week, shortly after Yandex announced its IPO and Mail.ru Group’s founders sold their stake in their company.","Chernyshyov said Internet companies are very attractive, despite the fact that Yandex will be only the second Russian Internet company to be publicly listed.","Yandex, which relies on contextual advertising — which is specifically targeted based on web site preferences — for the majority of its profits, processes about 65 percent of search requests from Russian IP addresses, with Google coming second at 22 percent.","The domestic market of contextual advertising on the Internet is projected to grow by 27 percent between this year and 2015, reaching $2.5 billion, making the IPO especially interesting for investors, and possibly distracting them from Mail.ru Group, Chernyshyov said.","Mail.ru Group owns shares in Facebook, a private company, which has given Mail.ru Group investors a feeling that they are putting their money in Mark Zuckerberg’s empire.","Recent reports suggest that Facebook is growing faster than expected, which means a possible IPO, and therefore a potential exodus of Mail.ru Group investors who had only been attracted to the company by its Facebook stake.","Such investors would then be looking for their next good deal, and could end up buying into Yandex, Chernyshyov said."],"isopubdate":""}

Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said last week of rumors of the FTC action, “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","The controversy has roiled company stock, and the announcement Monday of the federal agency probe sent the company’s stock sliding even further, down nearly four points at its lowest midday trading point.","Cambridge Analytica has previously said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party, and the firm says it cooperated with Facebook in deleting all the social media company’s data and related information in 2015. Such material was not utilized as part of its work with the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, the data firm said.","The Trump campaign has said it never used data from Cambridge Analytica.\nThe Judiciary Committee, for its part, said it plans to cover “privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use. It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss mounting privacy concerns and “how to develop ‘rules of the road’ that encourage companies to develop tailored approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while maintaining incentives for innovation.”","Pressure is building for Zuckerberg, in particular, to face what will surely be a series of public grillings, as the list of congressional panels demanding his appearance grows.","Already, the embattled billionaire businessman has received requests from the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has said it intends to extend an invite, as its panel continues its more than 14-month long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.","There are also international demands for Zuckerberg to appear before government panels in the UK, Australia, and beyond.","“On a bipartisan basis, we believe Mr. Zuckerberg’s testimony is necessary to gain a better understanding of how the company plans to restore lost trust, safeguard users’ data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems,” Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said last week in a joint statement.","Some in Congress have even begun to threaten regulation of an industry that has long fought against any curb of its activities.","“These tech platforms who are extraordinarily powerful who’ve been great iconic American success stories - they need to be more forthcoming or Washington is going to start imposing rules and regulations that may not fit,” warned Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and, himself, a former tech industry entrepreneur and investor.","Warner, who had just months ago insisted on a “light touch” to try to press Silicon Valley into action, has seemed to grow more frustrated with the tech CEO’s since last year, when Facebook, Google, and Twitter sent their top lawyers – instead of coming themselves – to the Intelligence panel to testify regarding their role in Russia’s 2016 interference.","“Facebook has -since the beginning of this investigation - have been reluctant, to say the least, to be fully forthcoming,” Warner said, adding, “I think it’s time for the CEO, Mr. Zuckerberg, and other top officials to come and testify and not tell part of the story but tell the whole story of their involvement, not only with the Trump campaign but their ability to have their platform misused by the Russians.”","Last Thursday, Facebook sent a handful of senior staff to brief aides to a number of key Senate and House committees on the most recent controversy.","The same panels on both sides of Congress who are demanding that Zuckerberg appear also want to hear from Cambridge Analytica executives, including its now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix and former data firm employee Christopher Wylie. The latter told ABC News that he had already accepted House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence’s invitation.","“One of the reasons why I’m speaking out is because I think that it’s really concerning that no one has really investigated Cambridge Analytica and its role in the 2016 election,” Wylie told ABC News in a recent interview.","Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel, also invited Russian-American researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who developed the initial app approved by Facebook to collect data on 227,000 of its users.","Kogan previously told ABC News that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are making him a “scapegoat.”","ABC News also reported Monday that Government watchdog group Common Cause filed a pair of legal complaints with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Department of Justice accusing Cambridge Analytica LTD, its parent company SCL Group Limited, CEO Alexander Nix, SCL co-founder Nigel Oakes, data scientist Alexander Tayler, and former employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie of violating federal election laws that prohibit foreigners from participating directly or indirectly in the decision-making process of U.S. political campaigns."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

When users ask to permanently delete their accounts, the company suggests: “You may want to download a copy of your info from Facebook.” It is this data dump that reveals the extent of Facebook’s data harvesting – surprising even for a company known to gather huge quantities of personal information.","I had a similar issue with mine on Android.

They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text I’ve sent.","In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson explained why contacts were uploaded. “The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it’s a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts,” it said","“Contact uploading is optional.

People can delete previously uploaded information at any time and can find all the information available to them in their account and activity log from our Download Your Information tool.”","Facebook asks users for permission to upload this sort of personal data for a number of reasons: address books, for instance, are uploaded with the understanding that it will help users find friends on the social network and help the app’s algorithms work out how to prioritise different content. Messenger for Android asks for permissions to read call and SMS logs for a similar purpose.","The company notes that users can stop continuously uploading contacts and delete all their previously uploaded contacts by turning off the continuous uploading setting in the Messenger app.","Permanently deleting a Facebook account will also result in contacts no longer being uploaded and all previously uploaded contacts being deleted."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.","Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.","Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\"","Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.","In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted all of it.","Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act \"and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.","Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.","The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","And yet as the firm sought to build \"psychographic profiles\" to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred.","Copyright 2018 NPR.

This is after it suspended Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm used by the Trump campaign in the runup to the 2016 election. Facebook says the firm improperly obtained data from its users. But as NPR's Amy Held reports, questions are mounting about Facebook's role in the data collection and just how vulnerable Facebook users are.","AMY HELD, BYLINE: It began with what seemed like a benign app on Facebook, a personality predictor developed by U.K.-based psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan. But those who downloaded it gave away their personal information. Facebook says that was fine - too bad if users didn't read the fine print. But then Kogan passed along the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook says it learned Kogan lied to them in 2015, but was assured by all parties the data was deleted. Now the social media giant acknowledges it may not be all gone. Facebook says 270,000 people downloaded the app. But Christopher Wylie, Cambridge Analytica's one-time director of research, says when you count the friends of the app's users, the data grab was bigger, much bigger. He spoke to the U.K.'s Channel 4 News.","(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)","CHRISTOPHER WYLIE: We were able to get upwards of 50 million-plus Facebook records in the span of a couple months.","HELD: To hear Wiley tell it, Cambridge Analytica used the data for what's called psychographic modeling and messaging - who are you, what are your fears and how can all that information be used to steer you?","(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)","WYLIE: It allowed us to move into the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before.","HELD: While he has left Cambridge Analytica and he too was suspended from Facebook, for its part, Cambridge Analytica said it deleted all of the data from the U.K. professor and denies using or holding any data from Facebook profiles. Nuala O'Connor, CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group, says even though corporations like Facebook need to do more to protect privacy, users should be mindful, too.","NUALA O'CONNOR: There is no certainty once you give out your information online that it won't be passed to a company or an individual that you really had no expectation would know about you, and that decisions are going to be made about you and what you see online that could really limit your worldview.","HELD: Cambridge Analytica says none of the data collected from the professor's company was used in its work for the Trump campaign.

The company previously told Reuters that it had never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica nor ever entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.","The Canadian federal agency charged with protecting privacy rights of individuals said on Tuesday that it has contacted its counterpart in British Columbia to discuss the provincial office's review of AggregateIQ.","ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING","With the scandal around Facebook widening, Britain's cross-party media committee had invited Zuckerberg to parliament to explain how personal data had ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, the London-based political consultancy which was working on the Trump campaign.","The company said he had asked one of his deputies to attend the hearing in London, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.","\"These issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position,\" wrote Rebecca Stimson, head of public policy, Facebook UK.","\"As such Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person to the committee.\"","Damian Collins, the head of Britain's media committee, asked the company to rethink. \"Given the extraordinary evidence that we've heard so far today... it is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning,\" he said.","Wylie was also quizzed on the use of data in the 2016 Brexit referendum, which has become a hot topic in Britain.","Whistleblowers have has said the main campaign for leaving the EU broke the law on spending limits by spending money with another Brexit campaign group that it was closely affiliated with, a claim denied by senior Brexit campaigners."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Don’t believe it, say former campaign staffers, employees, and other GOP digital strategists. “You get a lot of snake oil like this in data work,” one said.","Alexander Nix is a director at SCL Group and CEO of its subsidiary, Cambridge Analytica, which worked on President Trump’s campaign.","Last December, a Swiss publication called Das Magazincredited an obscure consulting firm that advised Donald Trump’s campaign with having “turned the world upside down” on Election Day. The article was an underground sensation in German, in a bootlegged English translation, and then on Vice, raising concerns that the company, Cambridge Analytica, used sophisticated psychological tools to manipulate unwitting American voters.","Readers shared the article more than 350,000 times, according to analytics service BuzzSumo. With it, conspiracy theories gave the firm almost unlimited power to control our lives with what one critic called a “weaponized AI propaganda machine.” And Cambridge Analytica itself has hardly shrunk from the controversy: Alexander Nix, the CEO, boasted that it had “profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.”","But interviews with 13 former employees, campaign staffers, and executives at other Republican consulting firms who have seen Cambridge Analytica’s work suggest that its psychological approach was not actually used by the Trump campaign and, furthermore, the company has never provided evidence that it even works. Rather than a sinister breakthrough in political technology, the Cambridge Analytica story appears to be part of the traditional contest among consultants on a winning political campaign to get their share of credit — and win future clients.","Every person who spoke to BuzzFeed News insisted on anonymity, with many citing a reluctance to cross the company’s powerful leaders, who insiders say include co-owner Rebekah Mercer, one of Trump’s major donors, and board member Steve Bannon, his chief strategist.","Yet when Nix claimed that on a single day during the campaign, the firm tested more than 175,000 different Facebook ad variations based on personality types, Gary Coby, who ran digital advertising for the Trump campaign, took to Twitter to call it a “100% Lie” and “total rubbish.” Gerrit Lansing, who worked with the campaign and is now the White House chief digital officer, also dismissed Nix’s claim as “a lie.” Both declined to comment further, as did Mercer and Bannon.","Cambridge Analytica insists it played an \"instrumental\" role in the campaign and made “an important contribution to the team effort,” according to a statement emailed by Joshua Kail, a public relations representative. But despite articles still featured on its website touting the role psychographic techniques played in Trump’s campaign, the statement added, “We have always stated on the record that Cambridge Analytica did not have the opportunity to dive deeply into our psychographic offering because we simply did not have the time.”","That psychographic approach starts, Nix has said, with classifying people according to five traits — openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. In September, the company said it planned to pinpoint 20 million persuadable voters in battleground states and target them with messages carefully tailored to those traits.","Several people who worked directly with Cambridge Analytica told BuzzFeed News that despite its sales pitch and public statements, it never provided any proof that the technique was effective or that the company had the ability to execute it on a large scale. “Anytime we ever wanted to test anything as far as psychographic was concerned, they would get very hesitant,” said one former campaign staffer. “At no point did they provide us any documentation that it would work.”","During a tense exchange at a post-election conference for Republican data firms, an audience member asked Matt Oczkowski, head of Cambridge Analytica’s product team, if his firm had used any psychographic profiles at all during the Trump campaign. According to two people in attendance, Oczkowski said that the company had not.","Some insiders say the individual data scientists from Cambridge Analytica embedded with the campaign did top-notch work, including recognizing that Trump’s supporters were different than establishment Republicans. They helped identify, for example, a younger and more rural group of supporters they called “disenfranchised new Republicans.” But those same insiders say Cambridge Analytica’s executives have greatly overstated the firm’s importance to Trump’s victory and overall strategy.","”You get a lot of snake oil like this in data work,” said one consultant.","Some of the concern about Cambridge Analytica stems from reports that it has a vast trove of information on hundreds of millions of individual Americans.","In several articles, Nix has said the company has 5,000 pieces of data on every American adult. As creepy as that may sound, however, it’s common: Campaigns and political consultants on both the left and the right purchase data about everything from voters’ age and gender to their magazine subscriptions and TV habits.","Cambridge Analytica has also been scrutinized for a database of personal Facebook information it obtained several years ago from a researcher at Cambridge University, according to internal documents obtained by The Guardian. The researcher’s project offered people a free online psychological test and the option to share their Facebook profile data. His methods were then allegedly shared with SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, and replicated without either the participants’ or the researcher’s consent.","In marketing pitches, two GOP operatives recalled, Nix has claimed his company has access to proprietary information that includes Facebook data. One of the operatives said the data was too old to be helpful and couldn’t be updated. Others said they’d received a similar pitch, but Nix was too vague about the details for them to evaluate what the data really was. None of the campaign staffers BuzzFeed News spoke with said Cambridge Analytica’s proprietary data had played a key role in any decision-making.","As speculation has turned to what role Cambridge Analytica may have in supporting the Trump administration’s policies going forward, conspiracy theories about what the firm is doing with that personal Facebook data have multiplied.","Asked a series of detailed questions about that data and how it was obtained, the Cambridge Analytica spokesperson did not respond directly, but said the company “does not obtain data from Facebook profiles or Facebook ‘likes’ as reported.” He continued, “Cambridge Analytica developed all its own methodology and its own intellectual property. It did not partner with Cambridge University on these.\"","Facebook, which told The Guardian in 2015 that it was investigating allegations that the company had improperly obtained data from its users, would not comment on the current status of that investigation. But as a general rule, Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesperson, said, “Misleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do, including banning those companies from Facebook and requiring them to destroy all improperly collected data.”","Kendall Taggart is an investigative data reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

CA’s claim to fame was the supposed identification of 5,000 data points on millions of people by which they could supposedly distinguish firm supporters from wavering ones, identify potential contributors and much more. Of course the millions whose data is being sold to marketers have nothing to say in the matter. This should be no surprise to anybody. Aggregating and selling user data to marketers of all kinds has always been at the core of Facebook’s business model, and US political campaigns were widely recognized and conducted as marketing operations for a generation or two before Facebook or even the internet came along.","The angry liberals have forgotten that eight years earlier the Obama campaign hired Mark Zuckerberg’s college room mate and former Facebook architect Chris Hughes to run their web operation, and to deploy and use the social networking data of millions of users and their Facebook friends purchased the same way Trump got it. The Obama crew was so good at using the stuff that a couple months before the election Advertising Age named the Obama campaign its 2008 “Marketer of the Year” beating out the likes of Apple, Amazon and Nike.","It’s true that Cambridge Analytica, technically the offshoot of a British firm is under investigation in the UK behind recordings of an exec boasting of their ability to invent and sell imaginary but widely believed bribery, buggery, prostitution or other scandals as needed. But they’re not the biggest villains in this drama, and what would you expect from an outfit which till recently had Steve Bannon on its board of directors?","As usual, the villains in this piece are NOT the ones the liberals want identified. Trump isn’t uniquely evil, he did and is doing exactly what his darling liberal predecessor did, and what a host of commercial firms do, buying and selling your personal online history and information. CA are certainly bad guys, but the only useful difference between them and a half dozen others is that Trump hired the one with Bannon on its board instead of a Democrat.","The issue at the bottom of all this evil mess is that Facebook, the data mining companies and the marketers they sell our data to are NOT just entirely unregulated – they’ve been allowed to write what laws do exist. Like Monsanto and the agribusiness crooks who bribed judges and maybe presidents too into creating laws which patent genetic material and ban labels identifying non-GMO products, Facebook, Twitter, the data miners and the marketers have purchased laws that prohibit programmers from writing the simple browser plug-ins that would enable users to easily choose whether to share their data with Trump, Obama, Steve Bannon, Amazon, and a host of other players whose names many of us wouldn’t recognize.","Late stage capitalism has transformed our human social interactions into the private property of a handful of billionaires. In a better world, the the social networks and the internet itself would not be privately owned marketing contraptions, they would be public property, democratically managed in the peoples interests, and users would to able to easily withhold their personal information and that of their friends. But democratic management of public property is socialism, and we can’t have that.","Or can we?","For Black Agenda Radio I’m Bruce Dixon.

While you may not have heard of SCL, its political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica has made headlines in the last few years due to work for the Trump campaign and the Brexit initiative. According to former US Magistrate and current Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal, this move is occurring because an app \"thisisyourdigitallife\" pulled in personal information of the 270,000 people who used it as well as information from their friends. While this is allowed under its policy, its creator -- a Cambridge psych professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan -- passed the data onto other parties including Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook's stance is that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015, which Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, said they did. The social network disagrees, and said it has been informed that not all of the data was deleted. Now it's suspending their access while it investigates.","So who are these people and what did they do with that data? Last May The Guardian reported extensively on Cambridge Analytica, citing a source who said Wylie is \"the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica.\" That same article specifically pointed out Kogan's app and its link to the company, which combined psychological profiles with specific names, phone numbers and email address plus information it bought from consumer databases. One of the claims it makes is that as much as promoting one candidate, its objective was voter disengagement and to keep potential Democratic voters home.","Facebook's VP of consumer hardware and former VP of ads, Andrew Bosworth, tweeted \"We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies. They cannot buy ads or administer its clients' pages.\" Facebook also noted that in 2014, it changed its policies around how apps can pull information from someone's friends, and now puts apps through a review process to find out if they need all the information they're requesting. But as a report by The Intercept detailing how Kogan's program worked by signing up Amazon Mechanical Turkers notes, the information had already been obtained.","As Facebook continues to investigate, there will surely be more scrutiny from all sides over how internet companies are protecting their user's information. Oh, and there's one more thing you should know -- this announcement comes the same day that a lawsuit filed by a US professor against Cambridge Analytica has been filed. Mother Jones reports that David Carroll requested a copy of the data the company has compiled on him and says that what he received is incomplete.","Update: Cambridge Analytica has responded to the suspension. It claimed it \"fully complies\" with Facebook's terms of service and that its commercial and political wings don't use or hold on to data from Facebook. CA said it had contracted Global Science Research to collect data within the UK Data Protection Act and with consent, but deleted that data when it realized that GSR had collected info against Facebook policies. None of that info was used in the Trump campaign, it said.","We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies.

It did not collect call or text logs from iPhone users because Apple’s operating system does not allow most apps to collect call and text metadata.","Facebook has stressed that it only connects to personal phone contacts when users grant permission. “Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with,” the company said in a statement Sunday.","Starting in 2016, the Messenger app from Facebook asked users to connect to their text messages and calls so that they could text, call or Facebook message any contact all in one app. The company was criticized for its “heavy-handed” approach encouraging users to make messenger the default application for text messages.","The Facebook app also asked users for permission to read contacts so that it could recommend more Facebook friends. In old versions of the Android operating system, that permission also authorized apps to read text and call metadata.","Android separated the contact information and metadata collection permissions when it released version 4.1 (Jelly Bean) in 2012, requiring users to authorize access to call and text metadata specifically.

Android disabled the ability for apps to claim an earlier version and bypass new permissions rules in October 2017.","After viral tweets sparked outrage about Facebook’s data collection policies, Facebook said in a “fact check” statement that the claims were inaccurate. “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,” Facebook said.","Manypeople on Twitter pushed back on Facebook for downplaying the metadata collection by saying that users gave permission. Users argued that most people would not have expected that granting the Facebook app access to contacts would allow it to collect so much information.","“I’m pretty sure that when the FB [app] asked for ‘access’ to your contacts, a reasonable consumer did not interpret that as ‘we can record all your call and SMS metadata,'” said a Twitter user.","Other Twitter users said that people agreed to terms that they did not fully understand and that they did not realize that Facebook would be collecting call and text logs. “Most people don’t read the user agreement and explaining that to them isn’t going to make them feel less intruded-upon,” Sheera Frenkel, a cybersecurity reporter at the New York Times, tweeted.","One user raised concerns that while some people may have knowingly and willingly given permission for Facebook to collect call and text metadata, those on the other end of the call or text had not.","Three Facebook users filed a lawsuit Tuesday over the call and text message metadata collection, arguing that the company infringed on their privacy.","Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this.

That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B.

Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.

Cook reiterated some of the comments and themes from yesterday’s event, like Apple having a long, 40-year history in education, and highlighted Everyone Can Code/Create, but also shared some new thoughts.","He said that the purpose of Apple being involved in education is to help solve many of society’s issues, as many of the problems are rooted in people lacking education.","When asked if he had a good sense of the challenges in education, Cook said that while many “people are on the sideline blaming teachers” and others, “teachers are jewels” and that “we don’t believe that tech should replace teachers” but rather amplify creativity and education.","The topic of technology being harmful for children came up, but Cook focused on the positives that tech can and do provide. “I’ve seen a lot of kids getting a lot of good out of technology.”","Getting back to the idea of the various troubles in education, Cook acknowledged issues in a broad sense, without getting into details. “There’s a lot more right about public education than there is wrong”, he said, and later adding that “we want kids to be creators, not merely consumers.”","The CEO of Chicago Public Schools, Janice Jackson shared that CPS has 80,000 iPads currently in use. For reference, there are roughly 370,000 students in the school system. She mentioned that they work to give administrators choice in what devices they choose, but that it comes down to device accessibility. She said she feels the cost of the new iPads are in line with other devices on the market.","The most interesting part of the education segment may have been when Chris Hayes questioned Cook over the tension between Apple’s cash pile and its proclaimed missions. Cook dodged the question by first mentioning that the company “hasn’t had access to the cash” before moving on to other topics.","CPS’ Janice Jackson mentioned the work the school system has been doing to try to bring more equality to education across Chicago. Hayes’ pointed question brings up the question, is Apple is really doing enough to make an impact? Or should it consider if it is doing the right things?","US investments, new campus, and jobs","As for Apple investing heavily in the US economy and building a new campus as outlined this past January, Cook said they wouldn’t treat picking a location like “a beauty contest kind of thing,” likely referencing how Amazon has been approaching the search for a new host city for its second headquarters. Amazon first started with a list of proposals from 238 cities.","From our point of view, we did not want to create this contest because I think what comes out of that is you wind up putting people through a ton of work. So that is a case where you have a winner and a lot of losers, unfortunately. I don’t like that.","He didn’t share any more details on a possible location for Apple’s next US campus.","On the topic of jobs, Cook talked about how there are currently 500,000 unfilled software jobs and that number could go as high as 3 million in the next few years. He said “we’ve got to reach out to women and under represented minorities” when it comes to encouraging education and training in the tech field.","On a macro level, he said that as some jobs become cannibalized by new technologies, we all need to “get used to the idea of constantly learning.” He also acknowledged Apple’s role and responsibility in making training and tools widely available.","There was some discussion of Cook’s current thoughts on DACA.","“I don’t see this as a partisan issue. I’m very disappointed with both parties,” Cook said. “It’s unthinkable that it’s happening in our country, it’s not who we are.”","…","Immigration is worthy of a national discussion. What is not worthy is kicking out those who have been here since they were kids.","Ultimately though, Cook shared a positive outlook on the matter.","I believe the right thing will happen here. But I’m very unhappy that we’re having to go through the angst…","Privacy","The last major topic was privacy. To no surprise Swisher and Hayes brought up the Facebook controversy, and Cook had a sharp response to the question of what would he do if he was in Zuckerburg’s shoes, saying “I wouldn’t be in this situation,” to roaring audience laughter and applause.","Speaking more on privacy on the whole, Cook reiterated Apple’s stance against using its customers and customers’ data as its product.","“We could make a ton of money if our customer was our product. We’ve elected not to do that. You are not our product, you are our customer, you are a jewel,” he said, rousing applause.","Cook used the ‘jewel’ reference at least twice in the interview, as he worked to communicate the value he and Apple sees in teachers and its customers.","When asked by an audience member about his advice for those with privacy concerns, Cook recommended to “become deeply aware” of all the privacy policies of the apps and services that we use, but also noted how difficult it can be to sift through 20-page terms and conditions documents.","Cook also talked about monitoring and curating third-party apps, the NRA app on the Apple TV, the company’s interest in health, AR, AI and more.","The interview ended with an audience question about what advice he would give his high school-self.","I would tell myself that the joy is in the journey. And the real purpose of life, uh, everybody talks about find your purpose, find your purpose find your purpose… the truth is, we all have the same purpose, and so we should all quit looking. Our purpose is to serve humanity.","He went on to clarify…","Most people ask themselves the wrong question. The question they should be asking is “how should I serve humanity?” What will be my gift? And they should ask that pretty much everyday. Because you can give small gifts and you can give some large gifts. And it certainly doesn’t have to be money. It will be a gift of yourself and your passion.","For more, make sure to check out the full interview on MSNBC next Friday, April 6 at 8PM ET."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

{"originalurl":"http://Millennialsoasis.com/blog/relationships/","title":"Relationships","text":["Relationships","Everyone is offering advice regarding Millennials and their relationship trends, successes, failures, or even sabotage methods. One thing for sure, there is so much advice and analysis for relationships, love, and affairs when it comes to this generation. But who is making all these, supposedly smart, observations? Is it the Millenials themselves or other generations making comparisons with their own experiences, and if so, are they themselves a savvy relationship advice givers or do they project what they see in others through their own relationship failures. One fact that cannot be ignored is that all generations, even the boomers, have relationship problems of their own. In every generation, about 50% of marriage end up in divorce within the first 10 years, and many more within the following ten years. So why should we listen to observations made, in particular, for Millennials?","Let’s look at some trends and try to understand that may be we are over analytical and relationships are experiencing social changes across generations and not just problematic for one or the other.","Younger Millennials aged 18–24 are often a little more worried about their careers, student debt, job security, and being able to make the ends meet than older Millennials aged 25–34. Older Millennials are more focused on building relationships, while still a little concerned about their current financial situation. The fact is, relationships result in more expenses. A couple want to go out more, may be invest in a home, travel, enjoy each other’s company, and may be start building a family.","Younger Millennials have time and are at the start of their career and still do not earn a high income and some even have to work 2-3 jobs at a time, not just to pay the bills but to search for new opportunities that may match their needs more adequately. This is the main reason why younger Millennials sometimes disregard quality of life in the present for the chance at having a better career and quality of life in the future to allow them to be positioned in better circumstances that allow them to start a relationship, hoping that their financial circumstances would ensure a more successful relationship.","Despite economic growth and many jobs being made available, at least the moment, do not assume that there are plenty of great jobs, or even good jobs, available for younger or even older Millennials. Let me explain this by understanding what happens at work place between various generations.","As people move through various stages of their lives, their personal and financial goals and priorities change, especially as they increase their family size. This obvious trend does exert some pressure on offering a career path for all new younger employees, while older employees want to hold on to their jobs and move up the latter, sometimes at any cost. They have bills to pay, a growing family size, a more expensive mortgage, etc. and this often produces more competition between the Millennials and the boomers, the employment gate keeps.","The 90-million-strong generation of Boomers created a workplace of highly competitive and sometimes aggressive and fierce atmosphere with 50-hour (some even 60-hour) weeks being normal and even expected, although may be not overtly expressed. The boomers also have some challenges with constantly changing and growing use of technology so they are even more insecure about their jobs and are not too pleased in being marginalized and moved to a newer, less-paid job that puts extra financial pressure on their households as compared to the younger are very comfortable and accustomed to newer technology since they already rely more on the modern technology for just about anything from shopping groceries online, to searching for information, job hunting, even dating.","One thing that most larger employers publically admit and are trying to find a fix for, looking often in all the wrong places, is the fact that they cannot plan an effective strategy to harness the key differences in the generations and utilized the diversity in age and perspective between generations at workplace while creating harmony between the various generations to accomplish their business mission statement while leveraging strong sense of loyalty and business creativity among the different generations. Employers recognize this precisely because their employees are also a representation of their customer base and brands that have a high social media presence, interact with customers through their user-friendly websites and blogs, and engage their customers digitally with relevant, fresh content have a greater chance to grow their market and, by contrast, brands that cannot achieve this, would soon meet their end. Why else is Amazon growing fast while household names like Sears, JC Penny, K-Mart, and others are in serious decline?","While employers recognize the need for harmony at workplace between the diverse generations, competitive nature of workplace is often very demanding and takes its toll on personal life, of course, in particular, relationships. Relationships among younger people are the first to be sacrificed to gain a competitive advantage (in this case, time) to work harder, longer hours, and build the skill set or the client list, or the project goals in order to get the job promotion that can potentially offer a more secure career.","All of this and career issues in general, is not to say that there is no relationship trends that are specific to Millennials, since this generation is obviously delaying marriage and starting a family, and seem to be shy of long-term relationships compared to previous generations. But the trends are as normal as the boomers in 1960s social differences compared to their parents generations. Every generation has a unique signature of its own depending on often a very unique matrix of social issues, economic control, and personal aspirations.","Sociologists love to sit around and come up with countless number of theories why Millennials shy away from long-term relationships, from dependency on social media, to a lack of need for commitment, or even not wanting to start a family until they are in their 40s or 50s. The various studies point to research that may not be any different (at least not in nature) than what boomers experienced, although one would agree the degree of it, is substantially different.","Older generations wanted a family although they delayed starting one more than their parents did. Millennials see this delay as the means through which they can search and find a more perfect match, i.e. someone to share their lives with that possesses all the compatibility they expect with qualities they are looking for in a partner. Millennials, generally speaking, don’t think they have to compromise and settle for less to avoid being alone. They will wait until they find their “soul mate”, and in the meantime, they can engage in relationships that are based on mutually agreed upon and acceptable short-term “friends with benefits”, and premarital sex. Being alone does not frighten them or make them think they are losing out. It is not a call to action as it was for the boomers.","The fact is the society today is very different, even compared to the last decades of 20th century when women did not feel as self-sufficient and focused on their own personal growth as women do today. At that time being married was somewhat a necessity not just a desire or an aspiration for having a soul-mate or a partner to start a family with. For most of 19th and 20th century, and may be even before that, marriage was the means to address financial security. Today many women feel that being single is the best way to advance in their careers and are reluctant to get into a relationship that would take time away from their career and personal development which may result in ending up as a single parent."],"isopubdate":""}

REUTERS/Thomas White","Privacy experts said the disclosure that a researcher had sold Facebook data collected via a personality quiz to the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of the kinds of practices that the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.","The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.","Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it “would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue”, said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems. Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.","Shares in Facebook fell on Monday by 7 percent, their biggest drop since 2014, wiping nearly $40 billion off the value of the firm founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg.","Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.","Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for “strategic litigation” over GDPR privacy violations.","According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","“The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn’t adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,” said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.","Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.","Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to “to give much less data, especially about friends,” Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday.","“We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,” the company said on Monday. “We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”","Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook’s overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.","The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.","“If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,” Deutsche Bank warned.","The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.","Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his ‘sell’ rating on Facebook after the weekend reports. Wieser expressed concerns that the company’s regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.","A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is. But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems Inc (PEGA.O), which makes sales and marketing software.","PageFair, an Irish startup that helps websites deliver targeted ads without using personal data, estimates that only 3 percent of European social media users will opt-in to targeted ads, a potentially “devastating” blow for Facebook and other platforms, says Johnny Ryan, PageFair’s head of ecosystem.","GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROL","The quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.","GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans’ consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.","Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.","“There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,” she told Reuters.","Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.","For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.","The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.","Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented “in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.”","In other words, the days of extensive “terms of service” agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.","In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more “permissions screens” and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.","That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month. “Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there’s some potential that people decide they’re not going to use the product,” Wehner said. “We don’t think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.”(This version of the story was refiled to correct description of PageFair’s business in 19th paragraph)","Additional reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels, and Paul Sandle and Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Marla Dickerson"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.’","In this piece, first published shortly after Donald Trump was elected president, writer McKenzie Funk challenged Facebook to do something about a firm that helped him win, Cambridge Analytica. Sixteen months later, Facebook has banned them. https://t.co/2oecalLUIR","The firm was backed by an investment of $15 million dollars from Trump supporter and Breitbart owner Robert Mercer, who was a crucial part of Trump’s election. Wylie explained the reasoning behind the alleged illegal activity.","‘They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.’","Previous reporting by The Wall Street Journal exposed Cambridge Analytica for their contacts with Julian Assange, whose role in the 2016 elections cannot be understated. Assange used Wikileaks to reveal thousands of hacked emails from the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, a move that irreparably damaged Trump’s political rival, Hillary Clinton.","‘The chief executive of a data-analytics firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing, according to a person familiar with the effort.’","Assange’s communications with longtime friend and informal campaign adviser, Roger Stone, were exposed by The Washington Post after Stone denied the communications to the House Intelligence Committee, saying that he only communicated with Wikileaks through an intermediary.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

While you may not have heard of SCL, its political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica has made headlines in the last few years due to work for the Trump campaign and the Brexit initiative. According to former US Magistrate and current Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal, this move is occurring because an app \"thisisyourdigitallife\" pulled in personal information of the 270,000 people who used it as well as information from their friends. While this is allowed under its policy, its creator -- a Cambridge psych professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan -- passed the data onto other parties including Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook's stance is that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015, which Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, said they did. The social network disagrees, and said it has been informed that not all of the data was deleted. Now it's suspending their access while it investigates.","So who are these people and what did they do with that data? Last May The Guardian reported extensively on Cambridge Analytica, citing a source who said Wylie is \"the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica.\" That same article specifically pointed out Kogan's app and its link to the company, which combined psychological profiles with specific names, phone numbers and email address plus information it bought from consumer databases. One of the claims it makes is that as much as promoting one candidate, its objective was voter disengagement and to keep potential Democratic voters home.","Facebook's VP of consumer hardware and former VP of ads, Andrew Bosworth, tweeted \"We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies. They cannot buy ads or administer its clients' pages.\" Facebook also noted that in 2014, it changed its policies around how apps can pull information from someone's friends, and now puts apps through a review process to find out if they need all the information they're requesting. But as a report by The Intercept detailing how Kogan's program worked by signing up Amazon Mechanical Turkers notes, the information had already been obtained.","As Facebook continues to investigate, there will surely be more scrutiny from all sides over how internet companies are protecting their user's information. Oh, and there's one more thing you should know -- this announcement comes the same day that a lawsuit filed by a US professor against Cambridge Analytica has been filed. Mother Jones reports that David Carroll requested a copy of the data the company has compiled on him and says that what he received is incomplete.","Update: Cambridge Analytica has responded to the suspension. It claimed it \"fully complies\" with Facebook's terms of service and that its commercial and political wings don't use or hold on to data from Facebook. CA said it had contracted Global Science Research to collect data within the UK Data Protection Act and with consent, but deleted that data when it realized that GSR had collected info against Facebook policies. None of that info was used in the Trump campaign, it said.","We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies.

It remains an open question as to when Amazon will take advantage of its significant reach and dominance in shopper data to ramp up the placement of ads in other areas,” said eMarketer senior forecasting director Monica Peart in the report.","Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.","Snap Inc.,\nthough still a small competitor, is forecast to grow its U.S. digital ad revenue by 82% to more than $1 billion in 2018 while increasing its share to 1%, according to eMarketer.","Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, is becoming an advertising powerhouse in its own right. Breaking out the estimates for just Instagram, the app is expected surpass 5% market share with $5.48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue, eMarketer said.","“Facebook’s user growth in the U.S. has slowed down and is now about the same as that of internet users, while News Feed ad prices may be reaching their limit,” Ms. Peart said. “Meanwhile, Instagram, with its rapidly increasing advertiser base, will quickly become the engine that drives growth for the whole.”","Twitter\nfaces more obstacles. The social-media company’s digital ad revenue in the U.S. is expected to decrease 4.9% to $1.12 billion in 2018. The company’s market share would ease to 1%.

He told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had received data from GSR in relation to a research project that they undertook on our behalf in 2014.","“He went on to say that Cambridge Analytica does not hold or use any data received from GSR.

It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma.","A few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds.","Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window.","Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach","Read more","But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments.","When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality.","The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default.","“The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said.","“Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.”","To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.","The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well.","The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable.","Aleksandr Kogan","To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters.","It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use.","And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred.","It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another.","The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database.","Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed.","Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”.","Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach.","It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie.

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The “behavioural microtargeting” company has also received around $2.5m over the past two years from conservative Super Pacs to which Mercer or members of his family have donated.","In an interview with the Guardian last month, Cruz said his funding and outreach apparatus “is very much the Obama model – a data-driven, grassroots-driven campaign – and it is a reason why our campaign is steadily gathering strength”.","Cruz is increasingly seen as a leading Republican contender, uniting factions within the party beyond his evangelical and Tea Party base. In Iowa – the first state to vote in the presidential primary, in less than two months – the outspoken Texas senator dethroned Trump in a poll for the first time this week as the mogul became ensnared in yet more controversy.","Cambridge Analytica has also worked with the Republican candidate Ben Carson, receiving $220,000 from his campaign earlier this year. But the company is more closely involved in Cruz’s presidential bid, with a team of its data scientists currently working at Cruz campaign headquarters in Houston.","Having donated $11m to the main pro-Cruz Super Pac, Keep the Promise I, Mercer is Cruz’s top financier – and the largest individual donor to Super Pacs or outside groups during the presidential election cycle thus far, according to data compiled by the political transparency website Open Secrets.","Mercer’s connections to both the Cruz campaign and the data firm that is apparently helping to power the senator’s advantages were previously reported by Politico and Bloomberg. But political strategists and privacy advocates agreed that Mercer’s parallel funding channels, combined with concerns over the surreptitious, commodified Facebook data – reported here for the first time – represented an intensified collision of billionaire financing and digital targeting on the campaign trail.","“If people begin to be turned off by Trump, the Cruz campaign will probably have a better strategic understanding of the implications and how to capitalize upon them,” said Bud Jackson, a Democratic specialist in digital grassroots campaigning, when asked to review the relationships. “Where a candidate’s campaign may be afraid to go outside the boundaries of ethical behaviour because of a potential public backlash, an outside group may be less afraid.”","See the full visual","In an interview, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said the campaign had contracted Cambridge Analytica “because they’re a market leader and best in the field” but that officials had “done our due diligence”.","“My understanding is all the information is acquired legally and ethically with the permission of the users when they sign up to Facebook,” he said, referring questions about previous research to Cambridge Analytica.","The Guardian contacted Cambridge Analytica prior to publication via email with its findings and a list of detailed questions. Repeated calls were also made to its offices in Washington and New York, as well as its parent company in London. A representative in New York refused to speak with the Guardian and hung up the phone.","After this article was published, Facebook said the company was “carefully investigating this situation” regarding the Cruz campaign.","“[M]isleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do, including banning those companies from Facebook and requiring them to destroy all improperly collected data,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement to the Guardian.","Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist and senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, described the Guardian’s findings as “troubling” and highlighted shortcomings by the FEC to adequately regulate campaigns’ use of data.","“What it essentially means is there is no one regulating campaigns’ privacy data and security practices,” he said. “So it means you have a wild west, where the campaigns can do whatever they want and get away with it.”","Research that seeded data on millions","Documents seen by the Guardian show Cambridge Analytica’s parent, a London-based company called Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL), was first introduced to the concept of using social media data to model human personality traits in early 2014 by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at Cambridge University’s renowned psychology department.","Kogan established his own company in spring that year and began working with SCL to deliver a “large research project” in the US. His stated aim was to get as close to every US Facebook user into the dataset as possible.","The academic used Amazon’s crowdsourcing marketplace Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to access a large pool of Facebook profiles, hoovering up tens of thousands of individuals’ demographic data – names, locations, birthdays, genders – as well as their Facebook “likes”, which offer a range of personal insights.","This was achieved by recruiting MTurk users by paying them about one dollar to take a personality questionnaire that gave access to their Facebook profiles. This raised the alarm among some participants, who flagged Kogan for violating MTurk’s terms of service. “They want you to log into Facebook and then download a bunch of your information,” complained one user at the time.","Crucially, Kogan also captured the same data for each person’s unwitting friends. For every individual recruited on MTurk, he harvested information about their friends, meaning the dataset ballooned significantly in size. Research shows that in 2014, Facebook users had an average of around 340 friends.","Source: media reports and documents seen by the Guardian","See the full visual","Kogan assured the MTurk users their Facebook data would “only be used for research purposes” and remain “anonymous and safe”.","However, the Facebook data was then used to generate sophisticated models of each of their personalities using the so-called “big five” personality traits and characteristics – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism (known as the OCEAN scale).","By summer 2014, Kogan’s company had created an expansive and powerful dataset. His business partner boasted on LinkedIn that their private outfit, Global Science Research (GSR), “owns a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles”.","Documents show SCL agreed to a contract with GSR, whereby it would pay its data collection costs in order to improve “match rates” against SCL’s existing datasets or to enhance GSR’s algorithm’s “national capacity to profile capacity of American citizens”.","In an email, Kogan said he was unable to explain in detail where all the data came from, as he was restricted by various confidentiality agreements. He said SCL is no longer a client.","He said that while GSR often used MTurk for data collection, it “never collected more than a couple thousand responses on MTurk for any one project, or even across all projects for a single client – the vast majority of our MTurk data collection as a company is in the form of surveys only”. He said GSR stores Facebook data anonymously.","Kogan explained that separate from his university role, his private company undertook various commercial ventures relating to data analysis. He said that when GSR collect Facebook data, the terms detail the use that information collected will be put to and make clear to participants that they are giving GSR full permission to use the data and user contribution for any purpose.","He said Cambridge University had “no knowledge of the clients or projects GSR had worked on” and that GSR has never used any data collected as part of his university activities.","‘Packaging voters like they’re consumers’","Today, Cambridge Analytica’s central offering to US politicians is to enable them to use the OCEAN scale in shaping highly targeted campaign messages. This allows candidates like Cruz to campaign on specific issues, but communicate them in multiple ways to different audiences depending on the personal information the company holds about them.","As the company’s CEO, Alexander Nix, explains in a promotional video: “The more you know about someone, the more you can align a campaign with their requirements or their wants and needs.” He did not respond to a request for comment.","Michael Zimmer, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he specialises in privacy and internet ethics, described this as a “particularly problematic” kind of voter targeting that raised broader concerns in the US about “packaging voters like they’re consumers”.","“It’s one thing for a marketer to try to predict if people like Coke or Pepsi,” he said, “but it’s another thing for them to predict things that are much more central to our identity and what’s more personal in how I interact with the world in terms of social and cultural issues.”","Prior to its relationship with Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with a handful of 2014 midterm candidates, according to FEC filings. The firm also secured hundreds of thousands of dollars of business with John Bolton’s Super Pac, formed by the hawkish former UN ambassador to support conservative candidates campaigning on national security issues.","Last week, the Cruz campaign launched a combative TV ad timed to air during a major college football game in Iowa.

I’m sure he needs some advice on how to spend it. Here’s mine: He should use it to undo the terrible damage done by Facebook and other forms of social media to democratic debate and civilized discussion all over the world.","Weak democracies are the most vulnerable to the curse of Facebook. I was recently at a gathering of experts who work in post-conflict countries, and all present agreed: Reconstructing a nation — any nation, whether Libya or East Timor — requires the establishment of a framework for national debate. If nothing else, leaders of the conflict have to agree about why the war ended, why they decided to stop fighting and what will happen next. Then they have to transmit that agreement to their followers. But if this is impossible — because “mainstream” media don’t exist, because Facebook offers conflicting versions of the truth, because no one trusts what they read — then peace is impossible, too.","Poor democracies are equally vulnerable. In countries — and there are more than you think — where reputable, fact-checked, independent media don’t function (because they’re too expensive, because the Internet destroyed the advertising market, because illiberal governments put pressure on the media), then the possibility of civilized conversation disappears, too. If different versions of the truth appear in different online versions; if no one can agree upon what actually happened yesterday; if fake, manipulated or mendacious news websites are backed up by mobs of Internet trolls; then conspiracy theories, whether of the far left or far right, will soon have the same weight as reality. Politicians who lie will be backed by a claque of supporters.","Rich democracies haven’t realized that this is also fast becoming their problem. Whenever I’ve described the disappearance of facts and the growth of Internet fantasy while in London or Washington, the response has usually been rather smug: How very terrible for all of those people in Tunisia or Slovakia, but “it couldn’t happen here.” But it can and it has: Donald Trump claimed that “thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey cheered the collapse of the World Trade Center, and thousands of real commenters and bloggers rushed to his defense on Facebook and elsewhere. Never mind that it didn’t happen: It is now possible to live in a virtual reality where Trump’s lies are acclaimed as the hidden truth that the mainstream media have concealed from the masses.","Those who don’t live in Trump’s world can find alternatives, of course. Ali Amin, a Virginia teenager, was so entranced by the world of online jihad that he became “absorbed in a ‘virtual’ struggle while disconnecting from what was real.” He wound up with an 11-year prison sentence for providing material support to a terrorist group. Nor is that kind of experience reserved for jihadis. Anyone who spends any time in the many alternative worlds that can be accessed via Twitter or Facebook can encounter similarly false information, in many forms and in many languages, every day. Just follow the right Twitter accounts, and you’ll get links to the fake websites and dubious organizations that produce invented statistics. You’ll find friends who believe in the invented statistics, too. If you so desire, you can then go on to live in a bubble entirely divorced from any reality except one created by far-right bloggers, left-wing anarchists or Kremlin spin doctors, all of whom excel at developing this kind of alternate reality.","Many of those who do the inventing have particular political goals, such as the election of Trump, or the recruitment of Islamic State volunteers. But the longer-term impact of disinformation is even more profound: It creates cynicism and apathy. Eventually it means that nobody believes anything. People aren’t bothered by Trump’s lies — or Vladimir Putin’s lies, or the Islamic State’s lies — because they don’t believe anything they read anyway. There’s so much garbage information out there, it’s impossible to know what is true.","Nobody yet knows what to do about this sea change, because few people have even accepted that it is happening or understand how it works. There’s a wide-open space for Zuckerberg to help journalists, academics, activists and politicians figure out how to bring reality back into public debate. Maybe we need to study “media literacy” in schools; maybe we need independent “accuracy indexes” to rate websites; maybe we need to work on understanding the psychology of conspiracy theorists. We don’t know yet what works, but it’s time we started trying to figure it out. And that is a $45 billion question.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Anne ApplebaumAnne Applebaum is a Washington Post columnist, covering national politics and foreign policy, with a special focus on Europe and Russia.

What could come of it?","text":["There’s Officially a Federal Investigation Into Facebook. What Could Come of It?","It’s official—Facebook is under federal investigation. Tom Pahl, the acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s consumer protection division, wrote in a statement Monday morning that the agency is investigating Facebook’s privacy practices a week after news broke that the Trump campaign’s political-data firm, Cambridge Analytica, inappropriately obtained data on more than 50 million Facebook users and then allegedly lied about deleting it.","Facebook could be in violation of an agreement it made with federal regulators in 2011 that required the social network to obtain affirmative consent from users before accessing or sharing data about them beyond what they’ve explicitly agreed to. Yet it wasn’t until 2014 that the company changed its data-sharing policy that allowed developers to access not only the data of a user who downloaded or agreed to use their app, but also that of their friends. That’s how psychology researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who made a Facebook quiz called “thisisyourdigitallife” for Cambridge Analytica, was able to obtain data on tens of millions of Facebook users though only 270,000 people downloaded the app. Sandy Parakilas, a whistleblower who managed Facebook’s app-security team from 2011 to 2012, told the Guardian last week that he suspects hundreds of millions of users could have been affected by Facebook’s porous data-sharing policies from that time.","Under the 2011 rule, Facebook could face fines up to $40,000 per violation, which could total damages in the trillions of dollars. Though Facebook’s fine is unlikely to be that high, it could be in the ballpark “of many millions of dollars,” said Jessica Rich, who oversaw the FTC’s privacy program and headed the investigation into Facebook that led to the 2011 consent decree, in an interview with the Washington Post. Depending on what happens with the investigation, Facebook may also face new restrictions from the agency, which would likely go into effect long before Congress would able to finalize any kind of legislation.","“The FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Toda, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices,” Pahl wrote in Monday’s statement.","Meanwhile, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify and explain exactly why his company shared so much data on its users without their permission—and didn’t keep tabs on where it ended up. In a series of interviews on Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that he would be open to some form of regulation but didn’t give a definitive yes on whether he would voluntarily testify in front of Congress. Instead, he said he’d be happy to testify if he is “the most informed person at Facebook in the best position” to do it. But as the company’s leader, and as someone who both was aware of the FTC’s regulations and of Facebook’s incongruent privacy practices, it’s hard to imagine who would be a better fit for the hot seat."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election.","-","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","-","It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending information over misuse of data.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Nix told the same MPs: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office.","It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in the largest ever breach of Facebook data.","Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence he supplied to authorities in the UK and US includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he told the Observer. “That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile information, but it was for research purposes only.","So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing of Facebook data.","Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica told the Observer that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Whether you believe that Facebook was complicit in the alleged breach, or simply an innocent bystander that was taken advantage of by Cambridge Analytica, is almost irrelevant. The outcome is the same; individuals have become concerned and hyperaware of what information they're putting on the web. This will have major ramifications for businesses up and down the country who are trusted with customer data every single day. If customers don't trust you with their data, they're less likely to want to do business with you. This is one of the many things the new GDPR legislation will help fix. More on that in a moment. First, let's take a brief look at what really happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook & Cambridge Analytica: a turning point?","The history of Cambridge Analytica is murky, initially established by Steve Bannon when he approached donors Rebekah and Robert Mercer to fund a political consulting firm. Of course, Bannon become Vice President of the firm and eventually Donald Trump's closest aid, but that's all beside the point we're trying to make. We're looking at data. Cambridge Analytica hired the help of a researcher at Cambridge University to create a Facebook app. The app was an innocent looking quiz, like the thousands already on Facebook, which collected data from people who took. This in itself isn't unusual and is a perfectly valid way of gathering audience data for targeted advertising. This app, however, exposed a loophole in the Facebook APIthat allowed it to collect data from the friends of the users who took the quiz, as well as the quiz takers themselves.","While those taking the quiz will have consented to their data being collected, their friends who didn't take the quiz won't have had the opportunity to do so. Their data, in effect, was stolen. To give you a sense of scale - 270,000 people took the quiz, yet the data of 50 million people was collected. The allegation is that this data was then used to sway votes with targeted advertising in everything from Brexit to the US elections. It's little wonder that, as a result, people feel betrayed or distrustful of large companies like Facebook.","And that's the turning point. Data has been hot topic for years, but it's events like this that really bring data protection into the front of the public's mind. We saw #DeleteFacebook trending on Twitter as their stock price fell by 7% in a matter of days. Guides on how to increase your privacy on Facebook started popping up all over the web. People became very worried because they sensed their trust was being betrayed. \"Data is the new oil!\" is what people have started saying. But what does all of this mean for your business?","People are more reluctant to trust companies and share their data, and that could prove problematic for marketers.","Protecting your customers' data is more vital than ever","Many businesses use customer data - like birthdays, marital status, hobbies and interests - to market themselves more effectively. It's a perfectly good way to do business, and if it's done right the benefits are felt on both sides. The business will secure more leads and sales by being able to target customers that are likely to buy, and consumers will receive more relevant advertising and a more personalised service. If you take away that data, your business will struggle to compete with its competitors. That's why it's more vital than ever before to demonstrate to your customers that their data is safe and sound with you. If their data is leaked or stolen it will likely get sold to the highest bidder. This can result in anything from unwanted sales calls to identity theft and more.","Cybercrime is more prevalent than ever before, and the revelations around Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are only pushing data protection further into the spotlight. Fortunately for consumers through the EU (which still includes the UK), GDPR will be enforced soon which should bring some peace of mind at least.","Why GDPR is the answer","Simply put GDPR will put much of the control around data back into the hands of the consumer. As of May 25th, 2018, consumers will be able to request what data is being held about them and they will have the right to be forgotten and, more importantly, get greater clarity on transparency on how their data is being used. It's down to businesses to negotiate how this is implemented, but it must be done or they could face hefty fines.","Business shouldn't fear GDPR. They should welcome it.","GDPR might cause some headaches in the short term, but it will make your prospective customers feel more at ease when it comes to sharing their data with you. In the current age of digital advertising, that's really important. Another thing your business can do to make customers feel reassured and more likely to open up to you, is offer real value in exchange for the data you're asking for. You can't expect them to give up their information without offering something in return - so that's something to consider when building a marketing strategy.","Always remember, you don't own your customers' data - you're simply borrowing it for a while...","If you're concerned about data protection and the incoming GDPR legislation, why not give us a call on 01442 217099? We can offer advice on the best technology practices to keep your customer data safe, and even carry out and on-site healthcheck to identify any vulnerabilities in your current set up. Don't let GDPR catch you out - we'll make sure you business remains compliant with EU law."],"isopubdate":""}

Accumulating dust, missed appointments, and those most precious of moments: memories.","But people are busy, and life doesn’t wait. I had tried, during idle evenings, to write down what I’d done during the day. I made documents on old laptops, carved dates into the corners of delicate notebooks. But they never got filled in.","The only place there exists an accurate picture of who I was is Facebook. Every little thing, immortalised in text. Free for me to access whenever I want.","I realised this after I sent an old friend a message, which blossomed into a conversation. She brought up a personal detail I didn’t remember ever sharing with her.","A two-finger swipe across the trackpad, and I was travelling back through time. Scrolling through the conversations, through the years, to an earlier time when we had been closer. The gaps between chats became smaller and smaller until there were several each day. And so there I was, my name next to words I felt no association with, recounting some anecdote, which had obviously stuck with her, for all those years.","I can’t be alone. I’m 23. I suspect most of my generation didn’t need to consciously store away thoughts and events, because we knew we would probably have typed up and shared all the great and miserable things that ever happened to us. We never had to worry about forgetting anything. Forgetting was finished.","After months of allegations that Facebook has been subverted by nefarious political actors (Russia, Cambridge Analytics), privacy-conscious users have begun to delete their accounts. But the indiscriminate stockpiling of personal information can also have a positive purpose. For me, it is my diary. I don’t want my memories obliterated.","So I downloaded all my Facebook data. The file is about 200 megabytes in total and includes all my activity on the platform, all cut up and separated into discrete folders. You might have thought you were just “connecting with friends” but Facebook has always been collecting data. There’s a detailed list of every event I said I’d attend. There’s a list of friends whose phone numbers the platform somehow has. There’s a security log detailing every connection I’ve ever made to my account, with every IP address and date.

Painfully, it’s the closest thing you will ever get to seeing a reflection of the soul.","You expect to see the photographs. You expect the banal advertising profile that has been built based on your likes. Mine has me down as a supporter of every major political party in the UK (good luck targeting me), the International Power-Lifting Federation (I don’t even know) and water, plain water.","But what you don’t expect to ever see again are the conversations you never remember having. You’re 14 and sending heartfelt apologies to mere acquaintances for having said something nasty in the playground. You’re 16 and using every offensive epithet imaginable just instead of saying “Hey”. You’re 18, and being told that you’re great but that the timing is wrong.","Most of it is horrible. I was awful, embarrassing, and stupid. We all were. Deleting it won’t solve anything. Any one of my interlocutors could easily unearth and open their end of the interaction and all that personal mould would seep out.","But it’s not so much the content that terrifies me, as vile as it may be. More, it’s the notion that there is this stranger with my name who lurks a mere click away. And he will always be me in the eyes of everyone else. I was the author of those thoughts once, while he will be their author forever.","The Facebook data is more CCTV than selfie; watching and recording us as we passed through different circles, social settings and scenarios.","This is where we lived our lives. This is where our pasts reside.","For the most part, it doesn’t feel particularly valuable. Most of life is banal and will happen a million times again. There’s a reason that, in a traditional diary, you sieve through it.","But rare bits do strike you. Sometimes the words you wrote not knowing that anyone would read them back to you provide an honest, uncorrupted portrait.","So be fearful of corporate overreach. Be resentful that companies who claimed for so long to be social are and have long been purely profit-driven machines. But don’t take it out on yourself. A social media platform like Facebook is so much more than just a means of reaching other people.

And a whistleblower says he believes the firm, which has ties to the Trump presidential campaign, may have swayed the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit vote.","Christopher Wylie, who worked at Cambridge Analytica and has brought forward accusations about how the company allegedly misused data from as many as 50 million Facebook users, told a committee in the U.K. Parliament that a Canadian firm allegedly linked to Cambridge Analytica developed the software that the Trump campaign used to target voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential race.","Wylie said he began to realize the impact of the company's work when Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and shortly after Trump's inauguration, he reached out to a reporter at The Guardian, initially as an anonymous source.","It was then that he \"came to appreciate that the projects I was working on may have had a much wider impact than I initially anticipated it would,\" Wylie said, adding, \"Donald Trump makes it click in your head that this has a much wider impact. I don't think that military-style information operations is conducive for any democratic process.\"","Wylie also alleges Aggregate IQ broke U.K. laws on spending limits to sway the country's 2016 referendum that set Brexit, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, into motion.","\"I think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome in the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating,\" Wylie told lawmakers.","At the beginning of Wylie's testimony to the House of Commons Digital, Culture and Sport Committee, chairman Damian Collins said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had not accepted an invitation to give evidence, suggesting that the company's chief product officer, Chris Cox, speak in his stead.","After hearing hours of Wylie's evidence, Collins was angrier. He called it \"absolutely astonishing\" that Zuckerberg declined, stating that he would \"urge him to think again if he has any care for the people who use his company's services.\"","Wylie portrayed Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, as totally without qualms about breaking laws and undermining democracies around the world.","\"They don't care whether or not what they do is legal as long as it gets the job done,\" he said. \"Broadly, this is a company that goes around the world and undermines civil institutions of countries that are struggling to develop those institutions. ... They are an example of what modern-day colonialism looks like.\"","Aggregate IQ has said that it has \"never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity.\"","Cambridge Analytica, he said, \"absolutely shared data\" it obtained from Facebook users with Aggregate IQ. Aggregate IQ then allegedly used that data to build the Ripon software, the election software platform that was also used in the U.S. presidential election.","\"You can't have targeting software that doesn't access the database,\" Wylie added, saying that he has submitted documentation to the committee proving this.","Cambridge Analytica has denied providing Aggregate IQ with the data it gathered, reportedly harvested through a personality quiz developed by the company Global Science Research. \"Cambridge Analytica did not share any GSR data with AIQ, We haven't had any communication with AIQ since December 2015,\" the company said in a tweet.","Wylie pointed to a report from Gizmodo published Monday, indicating that internal documents from Cambridge Analytica show that Aggregate IQ developed its election platform and added that Aggregate IQ also \"inherited a lot of the company culture of total disregard for the law.\"","Wylie personally supported the \"Leave\" campaign, as he told the committee, but was troubled by what he viewed as threats to the democratic process. He pointed to the fact that a broad array of entities and parties supporting Leave selected Aggregate IQ, a company that he portrayed as having no public presence up to that point.","\"When you look at the accumulation of evidence,\" he said, \"I think it would be completely unreasonable to come to any other conclusion than this must be coordination, this must be a common purpose plan.\"","Wylie claimed that individuals from Aggregate IQ bragged to him about their \"totally illegal\" behavior.","He also told lawmakers that his predecessor at SCL, the parent company, died under mysterious circumstances in Kenya."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Donald Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of – and which Facebook may have enabled.","The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.","Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 per cent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain’s information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica’s servers because the British firm had been “unco-operative” in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it “stood down” that effort at the request of British officials.","WATCH: Facebook data misused to sway voters in 2016 election","Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet , Stamos said he’s still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.","It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.","Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm “took fake news to the next level.”","“This is based on an idea called ‘informational dominance,’ which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what’s actually happening,” Wylie said Monday on NBC’s “Today.” It’s not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.","Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research – not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked – even though those friends hadn’t downloaded the app or given explicit consent.","Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.","Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon – later President Donald Trump’s campaign chairman and White House adviser – as a vice-president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.","The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person’s viewing behaviours fit with what other customers watch.","But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it’s connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media.","Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” He said the firm “works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.”","Wylie told Today that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn’t know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge’s data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn’t retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn’t use it in its 2016 campaign work.","Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.","Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.","Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.","It’s possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz’s campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.","Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn’t immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn’t immediately respond to emailed questions.","Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook’s mapping of the “social graph” – essentially the web of people’s real-life connections – is also invaluable for marketers.","For example, researchers can look at people’s clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.","Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center. While people don’t exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the “rabbit hole” of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about the company's privacy practices after a whistleblower said consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target US and British voters in close-run elections.","Facebook said the company had received invitations to testify before Congress and that they were talking to legislators. Facebook shares closed down 4.9 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 18 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled to Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The tech sector is down 5.2 percent for March and on track for its worst month since April 2016. The data breach has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation.

On the same day, Zuckerberg turned down British lawmakers' invitations to explain to a British parliamentary committee what went wrong. The company said it would instead send one of his deputies, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.","The head of the committee called Zuckerberg's decision \"astonishing\" and urged him to think again. Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 US election. AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie's remarks. Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.","Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in Trump's campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules. In full-page advertisements in British and US newspapers this week Zuckerberg said the app built by a university researcher \"leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014\". He apologised last week for the mistakes the company had made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.

The US House Energy and Commerce Committee and US Senate Commerce Committee had already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing. The US Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the company - which it generally only does in cases of great public interest - citing media reports that raise what it called \"substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.\"","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before US Congress: SourcesDescription:Facebook said the company had received invitations to testify before Congress and that they were talking to legislators.

This was back when Wired was actually cutting edge and not the insufferable Silicon Valley stroke job it became after Conde Naste acquired it. In it our antihero “Stark” finds himself inexplicably recruited as a kind of data scout, looking for viable consumer trends emerging from the fully immersive, all encompassing data field known as “The Spew”.","“When a schmo buys something on the I-way it goes into his Profile, and if it happens to be something that he recently saw advertised there, we call that interesting, and when he uses the I-way to phone his friends and family, we Profile Auditors can navigate his social web out to a gazillion fractal iterations, the friends of his friends of his friends of his friends, what they buy and what they watch and if there’s a correlation.”","The Spew of course, was the near future analogy of where the internet was headed, and when I went looking to link to it for this post, the piece turned out to be written by none other than Neal Stephenson. That means I read “Hack The Spew” and it made an impression on me before I even knew who Stephenson was or perhaps was on his way to becoming. Few would argue that Stephenson has a gift for seeing the general ambience of our oncoming future. Cryptonomiconuncannily anticipated the impetus toward crypto-currencies; the current systemic dysfunction of national sovereignty worldwide was foretold in Snow Crash; so it follows that all this will likely culminate in something that resembles The Diamond Age.","Today, “The Spew” is not equivalent to the Internet itself, but it is more accurately analogous to say the social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, especially when combined with the twin monopolies of Google and Amazon, collectively are: The Spew.","It is like a global garbage pile of digital flotsam and jetsam, over which peasants scurry around and scour, looking for some morsel here, a crumb there, which can be monetized. If a trend or a trait is detected, even better. Those can be aggregated, syndicated, federated, even rehypothecated and at scale that can yield staggering financial payoffs and perhaps, even steer the course the history.","At least that’s the narrative since the Cambridge Analytica scandal blew up in Facebook’s …face. After a long string of successive privacy fails (a.k.a a pattern of abuse?) this time feels different, as if the chickens are finally coming home to roost for Facebook.","Cambridge Analytica is not unique","Ever heard of Kareem Serageldin? Probably not.","To date, he is the only banker to have been sent to prison in connection with the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis for his role in issuing fraudulent mortgage-backed securities (at least outside of Iceland). To be sure, he was a fall guy, a token sacrifice to demonstrate contrition for what was a systemic, institutionalized effort to inflate a bubble whose implosion nearly crashed the entire global financial system.","In this case while Facebook attempted to throw water on this crisis by ceremonially banishing Cambridge Analytica from its system, the longstanding pattern of abuse remains, and is perhaps now, finally, awareness of that is reaching critical mass with the public:","And while there were key differences in the way data was used, (not to mention more informed consent) the 2012 Obama re-election campaign used the same data mining features and accessed the same data as the Cambridge Analytica app","In fact it may be veritably baked into their ecosystem to such a degree that it is almost impossible to develop and create an app on Facebook thatdoesn’t harvest your data","“At this point, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s pattern on privacy is clear. Launch new stuff that pushes the boundaries of what people consider comfortable. Apologize and assure users that they control their information, but rarely pull back entirely, and usually reintroduce similar features at a later date when people seem more ready for it.”","It becomes clear, as Futurist (and easyDNS member) Jesse Hirsh made this point on Steve Pakin’s “The Agenda” over the weekend: “Facebook ships with all privacy enhanced settings disabled” — further, my personal findings are that they use obfuscation to make it harder to disable data sharing settings. You have to jump through hoops to do it.","Should you #deleteFacebook?","WhatsApp founder Brian Acton, who became a billionaire when Facebook bought his company hasn’t let that dissuade him from telling the world what he thinks of all this:","Should you? Should easyDNS? Here’s my take on it:","If you are a business: keep your page but don’t be reliant on it","There is a difference between a business who uses Facebook as an antennae to provide additional ways to stay in touch with customers and those whose business model is completely dependent on Facebook. We started our Facebook page when we were pulled into the Wikileaks Crisis as a way to stay in touch with our customers while that entire fiasco played out. We maintain it today for the same reason, and people do frequently contact us through that page looking for support.","You have to credit the guy with dominating his niche but I couldn’t help wondering what would happen to his business if something substantial changed at Facebook, or if some of his readers would feel “used” if they understood some of the myriad tactics some of these sites routinely use, via Facebook, to drive their own affiliate revenues.","It brings to mind 2 things:","My late friend and one of the original easyDNS customers Atul Chitniswho was among the first to observe “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product”","My own maxim, which I introduced in the Guerrilla Capitalism Overviewthat there are two kinds of companies, those that feed on customer ignorance compared to those who prosper via customer savvy . I think it is obvious to all, at least now, that Facebook needs customer ignorance to survive.","(Or as Zuck eloquently observed it back in his dormroom days)","YMMV on your personal pages","I read a long time ago “don’t put anything on the internet that you wouldn’t want to read in the newspapers the next day”, and that has served me well as a guide over the years.","My basic assumption is that everything I post to Facebook, including “private” messages are wide open, being harvested, data mined, aggregated, used to target and retarget ads to me, build a profile and otherwise compile a comprehensive dossier, even stuff I’ve “deleted”. (If you’ve ever watched “Terms and Conditions May Apply” you’ll know that Facebook actually keeps the stuff you “delete”).","So I never say anything on Facebook or put anything on there that is remotely confidential or proprietary. It’s strictly a water cooler. I like it because it enabled me to reconnect with various groups of my friends and peers over the years, from the kids I grew up and went to high school with in Galt, Ontario to the misfits from the London underground music scene in college, to the tech entrepreneurs from the mid-90’s on.","Would I use it to send anything to anybody that I found myself hoping that it’s never going to leak or be used against me? Uh, no. That would be terribly naive.","So to that end, I’ll probably keep my personal Facebook page, even though I sometimes catch myself spending too much time arguing stupid pointless crap (like politics) with people I’d otherwise never associate with. But that’s a self-discipline issue, not a data soveriengty issue (although it is now also common knowledge that Facebook deliberately codes the platform itself to be as addictive as possible)","All that said…","At least #deleteFacebook from your mobile devices","Facebook harvests your contact lists from your mobile devices (don’t believe me, go here)\nThere are people in that list that I do not know. There are phone numbers from people who work for my competitors in there. My daughter’s (age 11) cell phone number is in there.","You can “delete” all this here: (but as you know Facebook never actually deletes anything).","Then when you go to “delete” all your contacts you get a message","“We won’t be able to tell you when your friends start using Messenger if you delete all your uploaded contact info.”","They say that like it’s a bad thing. But there is also this curious sentence:","“If you have Continuous Uploading turned on in the Messenger app, your contact info will be uploaded again the next time the app syncs with Facebook servers.”","I had deleted the Facebook mobile app from my phone a long time ago. I kept messenger installed because sometimes customers would contact easyDNS or Zoneedit via our Facebook pages for support.","It turned out I had already disabled continuous uploading but I was surprised to find that the messenger app had defaulted permission to access my phone’s microphone.","After this exercise I simply deleted the Messenger app from my phone as well.","Personal Data Sovereignty is an idea who’s time has come","I think it would be safe to assume, that barring some widespread public pushback (such as the one happening right now), this is The New Normal.","People who may have been complacently oblivious to the fact that their social network was pimping them as mere data points are realizing that they don’t like it as they have their faces rubbed in one data breach and privacy violation after another.","Given the outrages of Equifax, Facebook et al, we may have arrived at the crossroads and we may only get this choice once.","Do we push back and say “NO”, I own my own data, I control who gets it and what happens with it. ?","Or, do we calm down after a few days, or weeks and then it’s business as usual. Next year Zuck will apologize for some other new breach of trust ahead of his 2020 presidential bid, while us “shmoes” go ahead and vote for him."],"isopubdate":""}

Luckily, Facebook makes it relatively easy to control exactly what type of data such apps have access to.","Click the ‘Apps’ tab on the left to see a list of applications currently linked to your Facebook account.","Clicking on each app will show you exactly what information you are currently sharing with it. You can then edit the information you share with any given app by clicking the blue and white checkmark icons next to each ‘INFO YOU PROVIDE TO THIS APP’ category.","Taking these steps, however, does guarantee that an app won’t retain your past data. To ensure this, you will need to contact the app’s developer directly, which is possible by opening an app and then clicking the ‘Report/Contact’ link in the bottom right corner of your screen. You will need to have your app-specific user ID number handy, which can be found by clicking on an app on your ‘App Settings’ page and then scrolling to the bottom of the popup screen.","If there are any apps listed that you don’t recognize or no longer use, simply click the ‘X’ that pops up when you hover your mouse over its icon in order to deactivate it.","To add an additional level of security to your Facebook data, scroll down on the ‘App Settings’ page until you see the ‘Apps Others Use’ box. Click the ‘Edit’ button to see what information can be taken from your account when your Facebook friends use apps. If you don’t want your friends to inadvertently share things like your birthday, current city and timeline posts with the apps they use, uncheck all appropriate boxes.","If you haven’t done so already, to further enhance your account’s security you should also probably limit the audience of your posts and personal information to just your friends.","Doing this will let you download all of your posts, photos and videos as well as your ‘Activity Log,’ which essentially is a complete overview of everything you’ve ever done on Facebook, including your likes, comments, searches, messages, friend list, ads you’ve clicked on and IP addresses you’ve connected to Facebook from. Really, the amount of data contained in this document is dizzying -- and it will give you a very good idea of everything Facebook has collected on you over the years.","Once you press the ‘Delete My Account’ button, you’ll have to re-enter your password and decipher a garbled code to prove that you’re not a robot.","Once you’ve taken this step, your Facebook account should no longer be visible, though it can take up to 90 days for the company to scrub all of your posts and data from its servers.","Facebook makes it much easier to temporarily deactivate your account through the ‘Manage Account’ tab on your ‘General’ settings page, but doing this will not remove your personal data from the social media site. This might be a good first step, though, if you want to see if you can live a Facebook-free life.","You can also toggle your Facebook privacy settings from your smartphone’s Facebook app, though it is much easier to take these steps from your computer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

That position put Stamos at odds with Sheryl Sandberg and other executives inside the company.","A well-known figure in the world of cybersecurity, Stamos' day-to-day responsibilities were assigned to others in December prompting him to make plans to leave, the Times said. Stamos was convinced to stay on until August to avoid causing concern among employees, the report said.","Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","The news of Stamos' departure comes amid revelations that the personal information of 50 million Facebook users was stolen and exploited during America's 2016 presidential election. The data was used by Cambridge Analytica, a tech firm that creates \"psychographic profiles\" of voters for advertisers, by the Trump campaign.","This isn’t the first time Stamos has clashed with employers over their approach to security matters. He was previously the chief information security officer at Yahoo, before leaving to come to Facebook in 2015.

It will now take a Herculean effort to restore public trust in Facebook's commitment to privacy and data protection, they said. Outside observers think regulation has suddenly become more likely, and yet CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears missing in action.","The scandal also highlights a problem that is built into the company's DNA: Its business is data exploitation. Facebook makes money by, among other things, harvesting your data and selling it to app developers and advertisers. Preventing those buyers from passing that data to third parties with ulterior motives may ultimately be impossible.","Indeed, the most alarming aspect of Cambridge Analytica's \"breach\" is that it wasn't a breach at all. It happened almost entirely above board and in line with Facebook policy.","Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge professor, accessed the data of more than 50 million Facebook users simply by creating a survey filled out by 270,000 people. Facebook provided Kogan with the data of anyone who took the survey, as well as their friends' data. In a statement, Facebook said, \"Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time.\"","The one rule Kogan violated, according to Facebook, was passing the user data to third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by former Trump aide Steve Bannon and conservative donor Robert Mercer.","But even Facebook sources acknowledged to CNN that it is impossible to completely monitor what developers and advertisers do with the data once it's in their hands. It's like selling cigarettes to someone and telling them not to share the cigarettes with their friends.","The limits of Facebook's ability to enforce compliance with data usage was highlighted by Facebook's own response to Kogan's violation. Facebook says it learned of Kogan's violation in 2015 and was subsequently assured by all parties that the data had been destroyed. But Facebook also says it learned just days ago that \"not all data was deleted.\"","In a statement, Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said \"protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do.\" That may be a hard argument for the public to accept given that Facebook's business is providing people's information to outside parties whose ultimate goals are unknowable.","Facebook says that starting in 2014 it gave users greater control over what parts of their information are shared with app developers and advertisers. It also says it has enhanced its app review process to require developers \"to justify the data they're looking to collect and how they're going to use it — before they're allowed to even ask people for it.\"","Still, the sources inside Facebook acknowledge that such measures cannot guarantee that some people won't succeed in mining Facebook data and passing it off to third parties.","On Capitol Hill, the talk of regulation is growing louder. Lawmakers seeking tighter restrictions on big tech feel even more emboldened than they did in the wake of revelations about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a source on Capitol Hill told CNN.","Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has called on Zuckerberg to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she serves, to explain \"what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\"","Meanwhile, Zuckerberg and the rest of the Facebook leadership seem conspicuously absent. Neither the Facebook CEO nor his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, have commented publicly on the matter. They have left that task to Grewal, a lawyer. No one has provided an adequate explanation for why Facebook did not disclose Kogan's violation to the more than 50 million users who were affected when the company first learned about it in 2015.","\"We are conducting a comprehensive internal and external review and are working to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information,\" Grewal said in a statement Sunday.","All of this comes as Facebook is already getting questions about the long-term appeal of its platform, at least in the United States. The number of daily active users in the United States — a whopping 184 million — declined for the first time last quarter. Facebook also lost 2.8 million users under the age of 25 last year, and is set to lose another 2 million this year, according to eMarketer.","The Cambridge Analytica scandal is likely to hasten user disenchantment with the network, sources inside Facebook acknowledged. Facebook is increasingly being seen as a platform vulnerable to manipulation by political groups, foreign governments, or worse.","Ultimately, however, the real culprit in the eyes of the American public may not be Cambridge Analytica or the Russians, but rather Facebook itself."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","On March 17, reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London suggested Trump-campaign linked UK-based political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had been able to buy data on 50 million Facebook users in 2015 to use for microtargeting political advertising.","The data had been gathered via a third party survey app running on Facebook’s platform and using its API to pull data on the friends of the 270,000 respondents who answered the survey.","At the weekend Facebook took out full page newspaper ads in the US and UK apologizing for failing to protect users’ information.","Billions have been wiped off the company’s share price since the scandal broke.","The company’s share price also fell more than 5% today, on the news of the FTC announcement.","The consumer watchdog previously investigated Facebook over deceptive privacy claims, back in 2011.","And in 2012, as part of an FTC settlement, Facebook promised it would give users “clear and prominent notice” and get their consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.","It also agree to two decades of biennial audits.","Facebook avoided a financial penalty at the time, though if the FTC goes on to decide the company violated that earlier initial agreement it could certainly be on the hook for fines — fines which the Washington Post has suggested could scale to trillions of dollars if the FTC’s $40,000 per privacy violation is multiplied by the 50M Facebook users whose data was passed to Cambridge Analytica.","Whatever any eventual financial penalty might be, the reputational damage Facebook is suffering as a result of this snowballing data handling scandal is bad enough, adding to calls for policymakers to regulate social media platforms.","We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the FTC’s announcement — at the time of writing the company had not responded. Update: In a statement, Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer said: “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

But the social media site has found itself wading into complicated semantics over the past few days as it attempts to explain how a U.K.-based voter-profiling firm reportedly ended up with private information on 50 million of its users.","The social networking giant continues to deny that it experienced a breach, even after new information has surfaced in a long-running saga involving the digital research firm Cambridge Analytica, which helped deliver conservative-leaning election advertisements to millions of U.S. voters.","Facebook says it has banned Strategic Communication Laboratories and its data-analyzing subsidiary, Cambridge Analytica, from using its services. That follows reports that Cambridge Analytica, which U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign used, received a large batch of user data that was passed to it, apparently in violation of Facebook's rules.","Investigating Cambridge Analytica's Influence","Until a couple of years ago, Cambridge Analytica was a little-known player. But in early 2017, the Guardian began examining its influence in political campaigns, including the referendum for the departure of the U.K. from the EU - Brexit - as well as the 2016 U.S. presidential election.","Cambridge Analytica specialized in creating powerful profiles of users based on their likes and other public data. That information was then used for targeting content to those groups that they were inclined to embrace.","Early reports suggested Cambridge Analytica had collected 270,000 Facebook users' data, with their permission, after they filled out a survey. But former Cambridge Analytica officials contend that the firm, in fact, amassed raw data for up to 50 million Facebook users, The New York Times reported on Saturday.","Cambridge Analytica denies possessing the data now. But it appears to still be floating around. The New York Times reports that it obtained a set of the raw data, and a former company employee recently saw \"hundreds of gigabytes\" of the data, which was unencrypted, still sitting on Cambridge Analytica's servers.","Lawmakers Seek Answers","U.S. and U.K. lawmakers are calling for more action in the wake of such reports, with some labeling the incident as a data breach.","\"This is a major breach that must be investigated,\" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted Sunday. \"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves.\"","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It's clear these platforms can't police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say \"trust us.\" Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","\"This is a big deal, when you have that amount of data. And the privacy violations there are significant,\" Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program. \"So, the question is, who knew it? When did they know it? How long did this go on? And what happens to that data now?\"","On Monday, Klobuchar and Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., wrote to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassle, R-Iowa, requesting that the committee call technology firms' CEOs to appear and describe their efforts \"to combat attempted foreign interference,\" as well as \"to protect Americans' data and limit abuse of the platforms\" in advance of the next election.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will also be asked to testify before Parliament about how Cambridge Analytica acquired information about the social network's users.","\"Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,\" Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, wrote on the House of Commons website.","\"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,\" Collins added. \"We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth.\"","Facebook: Application Developer 'Lied To Us'","Facebook has known about the data leak since 2015, writes Paul Grewal, the company's vice president and deputy general counsel, in a Friday blog post.","Cambridge Analytica acquired the data from Alexsandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, Grewal says. Kogan allegedly created a Facebook app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" which purported to be able to predict personalities. Users were paid to participate, and they used their Facebook credentials to log into the app.","At that time, the app complied within Facebook's developer rules, Grewal says. Users consented to supply data, such as where they lived and what they liked on the social media platform.","But the app could also scoop up data on friends of those users and what those friends had liked, increasing its collection scope to as many as 50 million users, Grewal says.","Facebook's privacy controls could have blocked the collection of information about people's friends, but only if those people had the right settings enabled, Grewel adds. But he contends that Facebook's doesn't view the resulting mass data collection as a breach.","\"Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our platform policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica.\"—Paul Grewel, Facebook's general counsel","\"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" Grewel writes.","Facebook removed Kogan's app from the social network in 2015. In addition, Facebook \"demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed,\" which it received, Grewel writes.","But The New York Times and the Guardian, citing anonymous Cambridge Analytica employees, say all of the data may not have been erased.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Grewel writes. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","In the meantime, Grewel says that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica as well as Christopher Wylie, who helped found the firm, have been suspended from using Facebook, \"pending further information.\"","Better Abuse Monitoring Promised","Following Trump's 2016 election, Facebook vigorously denied that its platform could have been abused to influence voters. CEO Mark Zuckerburg famously called such suggestions \"crazy.\"","But as more indications continue to emerge that social networks were indeed by domestic and foreign operators to influence voters' opinions, Twitter, Google and Facebook have committed to more rigorously monitoring their platforms for subtle abuse.","Grewel writes that since 2014, due to privacy concerns, Facebook has made multiple changes, including implementing stricter oversight of data-scooping apps, such as blocking their ability to spy on someone's roster of friends.","But a Facebook executive, Andrew Bosworth, speaking via Twitter, said that clearly more must be done.","Bosworth's comment came in reply to Hunter Walk, a partner at the venture fund Homebrew, who said: \"We're gonna spend the morning arguing over the definition of a 'breach' but what I want to hear is that Facebook values my privacy as much, or more, than I do.\"","Bosworth responded: \"We do. Our business depends on it at every level. These policies changed in 2014, but clearly that was not soon enough or rigorously enforced enough. We must do better and will.\"","We do.

Stamos broadly contests that the situation doesn't amount to a breach, but acknowledged it's a \"nuanced and difficult one.\"","Stamos writes: \"I have deleted my tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.\"","Cambridge Analytica received significant investment from conservative donors, and at one time employed former Trump adviser Steve Bannon as a vice president. The company reportedly also worked on the pro-Brexit campaign. It's now being investigated by Parliament and government regulators over allegations that its Brexit work was illegal.","More insights into the company's activities may soon be forthcoming. Cambridge Analytica is reportedly in the sights of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller's investigation has already touched on social media efforts that allegedly violated U.S. election laws.","In mid-February, 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies were charged with interfering with the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election.","Twelve of the individuals worked for Internet Research Agency LLC, based in St. Petersburg, Russia, which was a content mill for social media postings that largely leaned toward conservative viewpoints.

Will Oliver / Bloomberg","Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to be received by both United States Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser HR McMaster in addition to President Donald Trump on his visit to Washington.","The Crown Prince's meeting with Mr Trump on Tuesday will be followed by a dinner hosted by Mr Pence on Wednesday, and another by Mr McMaster later in the week, sources in Washington told The National. Reports surfaced last week that Mr McMaster may be on his way out of the White House, but spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denied any changes happening at the National Security Council.","The Saudi embassy in Washington has not released a schedule of Crown Prince Mohammed's two-and-half-week visit to the US. But according to a tentative itinerary confirmed by US sources, he will arrive in the US capital late on Monday, where he will spend three days in official meetings, including with Mr Trump at the Oval Office on Tuesday and with Congressional leaders from both parties. On Friday, he may head to New York to attend business meetings and a US-Saudi forum.","After New York, the Saudi Crown Prince may travel to Boston, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and Houston. The schedule and order of these stops is subject to change, the sources said. In Boston, Prince Mohammed, 32, will visit the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University campuses. On the West Coast, he is expected to meet the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates; Apple chief executive Tim Cook; and business leaders from Uber, Google, Facebook and other companies.","In Los Angeles, the Saudi Crown Prince, who ended a 35-year ban on cinemas in his country in December as part of wide-ranging social change, is expected to meet major names from the film industry to encourage investments in the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia hosted its first jazz festival last month, and is witnessing a boom in contemporary art exhibitions.","The first days of Prince Mohammed's visit are likely to be devoted to regional issues, particularly the push to counter Iran, the war in Yemen, and the Middle East peace process. Mr Trump’s team is preparing to unveil a new peace plan to resume negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Last week, the White House hosted a summit to address the worsening humanitarian and economic situation in Gaza that was attended by Arab, European, UN and Israeli officials.","Regional sources told The National that while the US administration was pushing for a swift resolution to the Qatar dispute during the Prince Mohammed's visit, this is no longer a realistic expectation. While on a visit to Egypt this month, the Crown Prince likened the dispute with Qatar to the decades-long US embargo on Cuba, as one that \"could last a long time\".","A US delegation that included retired general Anthony Zinni and Assistant Secretary of State for Arabian Gulf affairs Tim Lenderking was not able to break the stalemate during a visit to the region two weeks ago.","Counter-terrorism and defence co-operation will also be on the agenda, with Prince Mohammed expected to meet Defence Secretary James Mattis, who has just returned from the Middle East.","However, the economic and cultural aspects of Prince Mohammed's visit are expected to top the political ones in Washington.","“Saudi Arabia is clearly courting investors, and also looking to partner with educational institutions like MIT and technology clusters to bring some of this expertise and innovation to the Kingdom,” said Karen Young, a resident scholar at the Arab Gulf Institute.","She told The National that ties between Saudi Arabia and the US today in the economic sense are stronger than at any time in the past, owing partly to the “intricate connection, as Saudi Arabia is a large investor in US companies and US debt, and their currency is tied to the US dollar in value”.","The visit is Prince Mohammed’s second to Washington since Mr Trump assumed office, but his first since being made heir to the Saudi throne in June last year. He also visited the White House twice during the Obama administration.","On Sunday, CBS will broadcast Prince Mohammed's first interview with a US television outlet. In excerpts released earlier, the Saudi Crown Prince warned that his country will obtain a nuclear bomb if Iran is to develop one.","“Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,” he told CBS This Morning co-host Norah O’Donnell, in the interview for 60 Minutes.","The prince also stood by his comparison of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to Adolf Hitler.","“No doubt,” he said. “Because [Khamenei] wants to expand. He wants to create his own project in the Middle East, very much like Hitler who wanted to expand at the time.\"","Prince Mohammed's US visit will be his third foreign trip this year.

Then they used this data to help the Trump and Brexit campaigns psychologically manipulate voters through targeted ads. The result was Vote Leave ‘won’ the UK’s Brexit referendum and Trump was elected president in the US.","Unfortunately, almost everything in the above summary is false or misleading.","First, There was no hack.","The data collected was scraped from Facebook user profiles, after users granted permission for a third party app to access their data. You know those little confirmation windows that pop up when someone wants to play Candy Crush or use Facebook to log in, rather than make a new password, for a random site? Yeah those.","A Cambridge academic called Aleksandr Kogan — NOT Cambridge Analytica and NOT the whistleblower Christopher Wylie — made a ‘Test Your Personality’ app, helped to promote it by paying people $2–4 to install it on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site, and used the permissions granted to harvest profile data. 270,000 users installed the app, so you might expect that 270,000 profiles were collected but the app actually collected data from 50 million profiles.","50 million?!?","Yes. You see back in the heady days of 2014, Facebook had a feature called ‘friends permission’ that allowed developers to access the profiles of not only the person who installed their app but all their friends too. The only way to prevent this from happening was to have toggled a privacy setting, which few Facebook users even knew existed (here is a blog from 2012 explaining how to do so). The friends permission feature is how Kogan multiplied 270,000 permissions into 50 million profiles worth of data.","That Facebook users were having their data shared by their friends without their knowledge or permission was a serious concern that many privacy advocates noted at the time. So in 2015, facing growing criticism and pressure, Facebook removed the feature citing a desire to give their users “more control”. This decision caused consternation amongst developers as the ability to access friends profiles was extremely popular (see the comments under this 2014 post from Facebook announcing the changes). Sandy Parakilas, an ex-Facebook manager, reported to Bloomberg that “tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers” were making use of the feature before it was discontinued.","To review, there are two key points to remember at this point:","None of what I just described involves ‘hacking’ Facebook or exploiting a bug. Instead, it all revolves around the use of a feature that Facebook provided to all developers and (at least) tens of thousands took advantage of.","The data collected was not internal Facebook data. It was data that developers (s̵c̵r̵a̵p̵e̵d̵ ) accessed* from the profiles of people who downloaded their apps (and their friends). Facebook has a lot more data on users than is publically available and it has it for everyone who uses their platform. No one but Facebook has access to that data. This is a point that almost all the journalists involved seem unable to grasp, instead they repeatedly equate ‘Facebook’s internal data’ to ‘data (s̵c̵r̵a̵p̵e̵d̵ )accessed from Facebook profiles using a third party app’. But these are VERY different things.(*changed term as per convincing suggestion provided in the responses.)","The importance of this second point becomes apparent when you read exchanges like this one:","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.","This exchange is being reported as evidence that Facebook lied to politicians about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. But when you understand the difference between Facebook’s internal data and data collected on Facebook by outside developers it is clear that what Facebook’s policy director is saying is very likely true.","So where does Cambridge Analytica come in to the story?","Well, they paid Kogan to collect those 50 million profiles. Whose idea that was originally is currently a matter of ‘he said, she said’. Kogan says Cambridge Analytica approached him and Cambridge Analytica says Kogan came to them. Whatever the case may be, this is the part of the story where there was an actual breach; not of Facebook’s internal data but of Facebook’s data sharing policies. Developers were permitted to collect all the user data they wanted from their apps, but what they were not allowed to do — even back in 2014 — was take that data and sell it to a third party.","The fact that there were (at minimum) tens of thousands of developers with access to such information meant that it was inevitable that data harvested on Facebook was being sold, or otherwise provided, to a wide array of third parties. Again, the disgruntled ex Facebook manager confirmed as much:","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on. Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers.","So given how prevalent Facebook data harvesting was and that there are many developers with more than 270,000 users to harvest from, why is Cambridge Analytica receiving so much media attention?","The answer to this seems to primarily be how journalists, particularly Carole Cadwalladr at the Observer, have framed the story. The majority of coverage has pushed two angles. First, that a whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica revealed ‘a major breach’ of Facebook’s data, an issue covered above, and second, that this ‘breach’ was linked to the success of Trump’s presidential campaign.","Chris Wylie the mastermind who ‘hacked’ Facebook…","This second angle is as dubious as the first and relies heavily on bombastic claims made by Chris Wylie—the pink haired ex-Cambridge Analytica employee pictured above. Carole Cadwalladr, who spent years on the story, has explained in various interviews that she approached the story not as an investigative journalist but as a features writer. This meant that she focused on delving into ‘the human side of the story’, or put another way- Chris Wylie. There are pros and cons to such an approach but the biggest drawback is how invested and reliant it made her and subsequent coverage in accepting Wylie’s narrative, which just so happens to paint him as a young mastermind at the center of global political conspiracies.","Cadwalladr fully endorses Wylie’s presentation and fawningly describes him as: “clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling” … “impossibly young” … “His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible” … “Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time” … “when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something — his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead — it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold” … “his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off.”","Wow… what a guy.","Cadwalladr’s person-focused approach might make for more accessible articles but it also helps to obscure the relevant technical details in favour of providing sensationalist quotes and personal anecdotes from Wylie and his friends and coworkers. Presenting these kinds of details could be insightful, if they were subjected to sufficient critical examination but this rarely occurs. Cadwalladr, instead, seems to have entirely bought into Wylie’s narrative: “by the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time.”","So let’s address the oversight and take a bit more of a critical look at what Wylie’s narrative claims:","That Cambridge Analytica claims to be able to provide effective tools for psychological targeting and manipulation… Certainly true.","That Chris Wylie, himself, was involved with some shady business and views himself as partly responsible… Sure.","That the self-promotional claims of Cambridge Analytica actually equate to how effective the services they provide are… Hmmmm.","This last point is the most important and yet it is also the one lacking almost any supporting evidence.","The temptation might be to point to Trump’s surprising victory but there are a lot of confounding factors there. Trump won, yes. But he won against the most unpopular Democratic candidate in modern history, who was vying for a third Democratic term (something which had not been achieved since the 1940s). Furthermore, he won by a very slim margin and actually lost the popular vote.","Could all that just be evidence of how precise Cambridge Analytica’s psychological targeting was? Maybe, but we start to run into the perils of dealing with an unfalsifiable hypothesis. A better approach would be to look at Cambridge Analytica’s relative record of success and failure. Unfortunately, we do not have access to their full client list but we do know that when they first rose to prominence they were working for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. That’s right, Ted Cruz — the Republican senator who was crushed by Trump in the Republican primaries, despite having the power of Cambridge Analytica at his command. I am not the first to notice this apparent contradiction, Martin Robbins made the same point on Little Atoms last year:","So the story of the Republican primaries is actually that Cambridge Analytica’s flashy data science team got beaten by a dude with a thousand-dollar website. To turn that into this breathtaking story of an unbeatable voodoo-science outfit, powering Trump inexorably to victory, is quite a stretch. Who else have they even worked for? Without a list of clients it’s very easy to cherry-pick the winners.","The techniques that Cambridge Analytica purport to use involve using social network data to build algorithms that can accurately predict what kind of messages will be effective given an individual’s personality and psychology. This is what the stories mean when they talk about using psychographics to micro-target voters. But a lot of the claims being made about the effectiveness of such techniques is widely exaggerated. Kogan — the Cambridge academic at the heart of the controversy — has made similar arguments. He claims that he is being scapegoated and argues that the personality profiles he gathered turned out to not be particularly useful for making the predictions needed for micro-targeting:","In fact, from our subsequent research on the topic,” he wrote, “we found out that the predictions we gave SCL were 6 times more likely to get all 5 of a person’s personality traits wrong as it was to get them all correct. In short, even if the data was used by a campaign for micro-targeting, it could realistically only hurt their efforts.","Kogan is hardly an impartial source but his claim accords with various studies that have shown less than stellar results for nefarious social media manipulation. Take, for instance, the controversial Facebook ‘mind control’ study, which I’ve heard several journalists reference in recent days. What always seems to be missing from reporting on this study is just how underwhelming it was.","Facebook ran an experiment on almost 689,000 users in which it tweaked the algorithm running their news feed to display slightly more or slightly less status updates from friends that contained positive or negative words. As any researcher knows, with such a large sample you are guaranteed to find statistically significant differences between groups. A more important criteria with such massive groups is how large the effect observed was. In the Facebook study this equated to a truly terrifying difference: those who saw less negative updates used around 0.05 more positive words out of every 100 words in their status updates, whereas those who saw less positive updates used around 1 less positive word per 100 in their status updates. That’s right Facebook might have been able to manipulate people to use around 1 less positive word for every 100 words in their updates. It would be wrong to paint this as Facebook being powerless, bigger interventions would have bigger effects, but it is important to keep things in perspective.","Note the starting point of the y-axis. There is a reason it isn’t 0.","The real story then is not that Kogan, Wylie, and Cambridge Analytica developed some incredibly high tech ‘hack’ of Facebook. It is that, aside from Kogan’s data selling, they used methods that were common place and permitted by Facebook prior to 2015. Cambridge Analytica has since the story broke been outed as a rather obnoxious, unethical company- at least in how it promotes itself to potential clients. But the majority of what is being reported in the media about its manipulative power is just an uncritical regurgitation of Cambridge Analytica (and Chris Wylie’s) self-promotional claims. The problem is that there is little evidence that the company can do what it claims and plenty of evidence that it is not as effective as it likes to pretend; see the fact that Ted Cruz is not currently president.","No one is totally immune to marketing or political messaging but there is little evidence that Cambridge Analytica is better than other similar PR or political canvassing companies at targeting voters. Political targeting and disinformation campaigns, including those promoted by Russia, certainly had an impact on recent elections but were they the critical factor? Did they have a bigger impact than Comey announcing he was ‘reopening’ the Hillary email investigation the week before the US election? Or Brexiteers claiming that £250 million was being stolen from the NHS by the EU every week? Colour me skeptical.","To be crystal clear, I’m not arguing that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan were innocent. At the very least, it is clear they were doing things that were contrary to Facebook’s data sharing policies. And similarly Facebook seems to have been altogether too cavalier with permitting developers to access its users’ private data.","What I am arguing is that Cambridge Analytica are not the puppet masters they are being widely portrayed as. If anything they are much more akin to Donald Trump; making widely exaggerated claims about their abilities and getting lots of attention as a result.","***I added a follow up piece to clarify some of my positions and address some of the common criticisms I saw, you can find it here.","*****************************************************************You can find me talking about similar stuff on twitter: @C_Kavanagh"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, had invited Wylie to appear for an interview earlier this week.","Glad to see Cambridge Analytica whistleblower is willing to testify. Recent revelations about Erik Prince, Roger Stone and Cambridge Analytica illustrate how GOP decision to shut down their investigation abdicated their oversight responsibilities to country. But our work goes on. https://t.co/lLPhzFzdzF","Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, is at the center of allegations that Cambridge Analytica improperly used data from more than 50 million Facebook users to identify voters who might be sympathetic to Trump’s message, and target them with social media messages. The allegations were first reported by The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper based in the U.K.","On Friday, Facebook announced it had suspended Wylie and Cambridge Analytica, while it investigated the allegations.","In a public talk in London Tuesday night, Wylie detailed his work for Cambridge Analytica and Steve Bannon, who later became the Trump campaign’s chief strategist.","Between 2013 and 2015, Wylie claimed, he and his team spoke to Americans in focus groups to identify deep-seated concerns. Then they tested ways to tap into those fears through social media. The slogans they developed later became the catchphrases of the Trump campaign, he says.","“My ears perked up when I started hearing some of these things like ‘drain the swamp’ or ‘build the wall’ or ‘the deep state,’“ Wylie said Tuesday, “because these were all narratives that had come out from the research that we were doing.”","Wylie said Facebook data collected by a Cambridge University researcher was used as part of a project commissioned by Cambridge Analytica. The firm says none of the Facebook data was used in the work it did for the Trump campaign.","Wylie described the work as a mix of old-fashioned canvassing and the use of millions of data points to test out slogans and push them onto social media.","“We would just go chat with people. We would go sit in their living rooms. We would look at how they live,” said Wylie, who later added, “One of the things that started to emerge was that we literally heard these sort of narratives about Washington as something that was, like, gross and disgusting, that was dirty.”","So his team tested the phrase “drain that swamp” to see if people would respond to it on social media. After all, they had access to the data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge.","And people responded. Through the Internet and Trump’s speeches, the slogan became one of the campaign’s most identifiable soundbites.","Wylie also described Bannon as obsessed with the idea of separating the U.S. from the rest of the world so the country can rediscover itself.","Trump’s campaign for a wall along the Mexican border is not really about stopping immigrants, Wylie said.","“It’s to embody separation,” he said. “If you can embody that separation and you can further distance in the minds of Americans, us here in America, and them elsewhere, even if it is just across a river, or just across a desert, then you have won that culture war.”","==========","Recommended Products","Video Chief Club (by)Profit $500 - $1,000 Per Video By Leveraging One of The Largest Library of Pre-Made Videos, Script Templates, VoiceOver Templates And More…Instantly Access Over 600 High-Converting Templates Spread Across More Than A Dozen Of The Hottest Niches!","The Ultimate Harmonic Pattern Trading GuidesA TRADING STRATEGY GUIDES #1 Best Seller!

The “Facebook Container,” as the new extension is called, isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of the web. That means Facebook will not be able to use your other web activity to send your targeted advertising.","To be clear, this extension wouldn’t have saved users’ data from being compromised as it was in the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and it does nothing to prevent Facebook advertisers from diving into your profile and your activity while on the social network in order to target you with advertisements while browsing Facebook.","However, it is meant to plug at least one of the holes in Facebook’s leaky dam by offering a way for users to prevent Facebook from gaining even more data collected outside its service.","“Containers are a feature built into the Firefox platform that separate user cookies and site data into different cookie jars,” explains Jeff Griffiths, Product Lead for Firefox. “For Facebook Container specifically, this means that a user should only be able to log in in the Facebook Container. Facebook cookies and site data that identify the user are only available to that Container, and only Facebook can be open in that Container,” he says.","When you install the new extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of the social network. The next time you open Facebook, you’ll notice it’s been opened in a blue-colored “container” tab.","From within that tab, you can continue to use Facebook normally. However, if you click a link that would take you to a page off of Facebook, it will load the URL outside the container. Similarly, if you click any Facebook Share buttons outside of Facebook, it will load those in the Facebook container. (But this will send information to Facebook about the website you shared them from, it should be noted.)","In addition, you may not be able to login to third-party apps with your Facebook credentials, and the embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons you see around the web won’t work either.","“This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity,” explains The Firefox Frontier blog. “So it may look different than what you are used to seeing.”","Actually, it may surprise you to find out how widespread your use of Facebook was when outside the social network.","Facebook’s platform and its off-site advertising network allow other sites and apps to access users’ Facebook data even when users aren’t on Facebook itself. Facebook is hardly alone in terms of companies doing this. But it is making headlines over data mishandling, which means it’s a good time for Mozilla to capitalize on consumers’ concerns to share their messages – and tools – focused on data privacy.","Mozilla said it sped up its work on the Facebook Container add-on, which is based on technology it’s been developing over the past couple of years, as it’s seen increasing consumer demand for tools for managing privacy and security.","There are other tools available to help consumers with these issues today, as well, including the Ghostery anti-tracking extension now owned by Cliqz, ad blockers (including those bundled with browsers like Safari), and more.","However, single-purpose tools like this are useful because they allow people to limit some data-sharing activity, without having to take the drastic step of deleting Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski","By David Ingram and Peter Henderson","(Reuters) - Data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users in developing techniques to support President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, the New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday.","The Massachusetts attorney general said her office was launching an investigation after the news reports.","\"Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,\" Maura Healey said on Twitter in a post that linked to a Times report.","Facebook on Friday said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica after finding data privacy policies had been violated.","The newspapers, which cited former Cambridge Analytica employees, associates and documents, said the data breach was one of the largest in the history of Facebook Inc.","The Observer said Cambridge Analytica used the data, taken without authorization in early 2014, to build a software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","The newspaper quoted whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped set up Cambridge Analytica and worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, as saying the system could profile individual voters to target them with personalized political advertisements.","The more than 50 million profiles represented about a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential U.S. voters, at the time, the Observer said.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the newspaper said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","SUSPENDED FROM FACEBOOK","Facebook said on Friday it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent group Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. http://bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica said GSR \"was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" he said.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" the spokesman said.","He said \"no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","\"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,\" Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports \"important and powerful\" but said it was \"incorrect to call this a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\"","\"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,\" he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it \"provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.\"","Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday.","In past interviews with Reuters, he has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West\" and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world's largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, said in a Twitter post.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses \"behavioral microtargeting,\" or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called \"research app\" that used Facebook's login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information \"in a legitimate way\" but \"he did not subsequently abide by our rules\" when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan's app when it learned of the violation in 2015, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that \"not all data was deleted,\" prompting the suspension announced on Friday.","(Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom and Dustin Volz in Washington and Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by Paul Simao and Bill Trott)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

At the time, apps could scrape data from both their users and the friends of those users, unless you had your privacy setting sufficiently locked down.","The company actually built an \"Anonymous Login\" tool that was specifically created so that Facebook users could log into third-party services without making all of their data available to developers.","But the once-hyped feature never launched. Facebook quietly killed the project, allegedly due to lack of interest.","That wasn't supposed to be the case, though. Anonymous Login was one of the first new features announced at Facebook's annual F8 developer conference in 2014, billed as part of a new effort to put \"people first.\"","\"We know that some people are scared of pressing this blue button,\" Zuckerberg said, referring to the now-ubiquitous \"login in with Facebook\" button. \"We don't ever want anyone to be surprised about how they're sharing on Facebook, that's not good for anyone.\"","The solution: an alternative Facebook login that would allow users to sign up to use an app without handing over personal data to the developer. Called Anonymous Login, the tool offered the same ease of use as the normal Facebook login, but Facebook would keep your identity anonymous to the developer.","Facebook's 'Anonymous Login' feature that never launched.","Image: facebook","\"The idea are is that even if you don't want an app to know who you are yet, you still want a streamlined experience of singing in,\" Zuckerberg said. \"This is going to let you try apps without fear.\"","But even though the feature was showcased prominently during Zuckerberg's keynote, it never launched. Not only that, Facebook barely mentioned it ever again.","The company confirmed that it officially killed the feature in August 2015, 16 months after the initial announcement, due to lack of interest from developers. As Recode reported that year, there was little incentive for developers to adopt the login feature.","Developers, much like Facebook, love data. The more they know about their users, the more effectively they can target them with ads, or figure out how to get them to spend more time in their apps. This is impossible to do without knowing their actual identity.","But it also seems that Facebook did very little to encourage developers to adopt the feature, either. It never launched more widely beyond the initial group of developers, for one. And, despite touting it as part of a new \"people first\" approach, the company didn't seem to care much at the end of they day whether it was actually used.","To be clear, Anonymous Login couldn't have prevented the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. By all accounts, the data in question had already been obtained by the time Facebook introduced the feature.","But it's an idea that's worth revisiting knowing now what we should have known then about the consequences of handing over all our data to Facebook's developers so willingly. At a time when distrust of Facebook, and the services that plug into it, is at an all-time high, having a feature like Anonymous Login could help users feel like they have some semblance of control over their data.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone – including the Trump campaign – who might potentially use this data from Facebook’s platform."],"isopubdate":""}

First we learned about Cambridge Analytica. Now we know Facebook collected call and SMS history for years by abusing Android permissions.It almost feels like every week, we’re seeing another egregious data breach or privacy violation.","Working on a camera app, we have a deep understanding of what’s stored on our phones. We think about privacy a lot, and we’re surprised when people grant access to their photo library without pause.","Modern phones can analyze a thousand photos per minute. Combine your “Selfies” album with machine learning, and it’s trivial to figure out your age and gender.","It bears repeating, this can be done on your phone. No need to upload photos. Just summarize the interesting details, and upload to the cloud in seconds. And once you grant an app access to your Photos, you really do give it access to all your photos.","Take a lot of photos of your dog? Ad companies can show you ads about dog food. Ever snap a photo of an awesome dinner? Ad companies can figure out your favorite food.The GPS coordinates stored in your photos can show your travel patterns, where you work, live, and all the places you frequent.","There’s no evidence that Facebook does this now, but they believe OS permissions grant consent for anything they can dream up. They know that if they’re caught they can get away with a statement like “It was just a test!”","Not everyone has the freedom to #DeleteFacebook and its subsidiaries. Countries like Brazil and the Netherlands use WhatsApp like a public utility, and Facebook Groups is used by life-or-death support groups and public organizations for crucial information.","We’re no different: as a small outfit building an iOS photography app, we can’t quit Instagram, because it’s the pre-eminent photo sharing platform.","Heck, even if you delete your Facebook account, they can still collect information about you without an account — which leaves you feeling utterly helpless.","So what can you do? Until everyone moves to the next social platform, we can recommend some steps to mitigate Instagram’s mischief.","Step 1: Revoke Access, Use Sharing","Go to system settings, tap on Instagram, and disable access to Photos.","You’re probably wondering how you’ll upload photos. Will you have to toggle this on and off all the time? Nope!","Rather than upload directly through Instagram, open your photo in the system Photos app and tap the share button.","In the share window, tap the Instagram icon.","You can send it directly to Instagram, without granting access to your entire library.","You don’t get access to Instagram’s filters, but this is 2018: There’s tons of free and paid photo filter apps that give even better results.","Step 2: Disable Location, Watch out for Tags","Go back to System settings and make sure you’ve disabled Location.","Problem solved, right? If only it were that simple.","A few weeks ago my family threw me an engagement party in Boston. I took a photo, but didn’t upload it until I was back in California. When I went to tag the location, somehow it knew to suggest Boston!","I was uploading this from 3,000 miles away.","It’s easy to forget photos have location information embedded in them. When you upload a photo to Instagram, this location data comes along for the ride.","Open the “Places” album on your phone. If you’re like me, most photos are clustered around home and work. Facebook can figure this out, too.","What can we do? We thought about this problem from the very beginning of Halide, and included a button to toggle location tagging.","For a long time, we kept location off by default, but many people emailed support, upset their photos didn’t have location tags. In a recent update, we turned this on by default, and users are much happier.","Over time, we’ve accepted that nobody wants to manage this stuff by hand. We’ve racked our brains to figure out a better solution. Normally we don’t pre-announce features, but today we’re making an exception.","In a future update to Halide, we’re removing location data from photos you share to Facebook or Instagram. We haven’t decided yet if this will be opt-in or opt-out, but you’ll be able to change this in Settings (and feel free to let us know your preference!).","Step 3: Disable Tracking","Facebook spends a ton of time and money to convince companies to add Facebook code to their app. It’s known as their ‘Software Development Kit,’ or SDK.","Their SDK makes it really easy to hook up a “Login With Facebook” button, but maybe the biggest reason is conversion tracking. When app-makers run ads on Facebook, they want to know how many people who saw their ad went on to download their app. So Facebook asks developers to “phone home” whenever their app starts.","There’s no opt-out.","Facebook’s SDK sends back the iOS Advertiser identifier. This is a unique number that’s the same across all your apps. Because Facebook sees the same ID, they can cross reference it and figure out who your are what apps you’ve used.","You don’t need a Facebook account. With just the advertiser ID, Facebook can construct a profile about the apps you use. With a web view, they can then link you to cookie and track you on any site with a “Like” button.","What can we do? Open System Settings, tap ‘Privacy,’ ‘Advertising’ and turn on the ‘Limit Ad Tracking’ switch.","This will deny Facebook the identifier that can be tracked back to you. At least, in theory.","Unfortunately, advertising companies have entire teams whose only job is to find clever workarounds to track you anyway. Shout-out to whoever works at Apple playing this game of cat-and-mouse.","Step Impossible: Avoid Apps with the Facebook SDK","When an app uses the Facebook SDK, Facebook gets access to the same permissions that the containing app has. Let that sink in.","I dug through a few popular photography apps on the iPhone with a disassembler. I discovered VSCO uses the Facebook SDK.","Using VSCO, you’d have no idea it’s talking to Facebook. We wager they’re just using it to track ad conversion, but who knows? Sadly, the web has tools like Ghostery to block trackers, but there’s no such solution for mobile apps.","We can do our part, though:","Our Pledge","Your photos are some of the most private and personal data you own. It takes a lot of trust us to grant us privacy permissions, and we will never violate that trust.","We treat your data as private, by default. We do not share any information with other companies. We don’t send your photos anywhere, or analyze them for private information. We don’t use any third party SDKs, and we audit every line of code that makes its way into the app. We will only associate ourselves with people and companies that feel the same way.","Finally, we will be spinning down our Facebook presence and directing people to use our official (off-Facebook) support channels and feeds. We haven’t spent a single dollar in advertising to support Facebook in 2018, and we don’t plan to."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Their friends.’”","Davidsen also shared a link to a talk from 2015, in which she recalled how Facebook’s privacy policies in 2012 helped the Obama team win an army of supporters.","“The privacy policies at that time on Facebook were – if they opted in, they could tell us who all their friends were.

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I'm going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

This information comes from five sources who claim to have discussed the situation with President Trump, “He’s obsessed with Amazon,” a source said. “Obsessed.”","President Trump is reportedly considering altering Amazon’s tax treatment as he is worried that the e-commerce giant may put small, privately owned “mom-and-pop” stores out of business. One source stated: “He’s wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.” The President reportedly focuses on Amazon when discussing tax policy and antitrust cases but has yet to develop a full plan to crack down on the company.","President Trump reportedly has issues with Amazon’s impact on smaller businesses and with what he believes to be the abuse of the U.S. postal system who deliver Amazon’s packages for an extremely low fee. The President previously stated in a tweet “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” A source stated “The whole post office thing, that’s very much a perception he has. It’s been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.”","Axios’ Kim Hart commented on the President’s focus on Amazon saying: “Trump told Axios last year he doesn’t mind Facebook because it helps him reach his audience. He’s an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores. It reminds me of the story Jim wrote a while back about Trump’s fixation with 1950s life. Amazon takes direct aim at some of the core components of mid-century business.”","However, Vice President Pence is reportedly quite interested in the possible regulation or breaking up of large tech companies such as Google or Facebook. The Vice President is reportedly worried about the social media companies influence on the media and their monopoly of the advertising industry and control of user data.","Taking into consideration the fact that Trump’s engagement on Facebook dropped by 45 percent following the site’s News Feed algorithm change earlier this year, perhaps he will come around on the subject as well.","Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

If that sounds highfalutin, that's because it is: Internet access is a human right, according to the UN, just like the right to own property, start a family and seek asylum. Privacy's on the list too, but the state of privacy on the internet is, well, on this week's Make Me Smart, Kai Ryssdal used the phrase \"apocolyptically hosed.\"","After our conversation with Joel Reidenberg, Molly Wood mentioned European privacy regulations, noting they're generally more consumer-focused than U.S. rules.","\"Who is the focus of these laws? Is it about protecting us, and giving us all the information we need and allowing us to make informed choices?\" she asked. \"Or is it about allowing Comcast to keep up with Google and Facebook when it comes to business models that rely on your personal data? I think that is a tension that's part of being American.\"","That's more or less true, according to experts we talked with. Especially as new regulations spread through the European Union, privacy laws abroad are generally more comprehensive, easy to understand and consumer-friendly than the laws in the U.S.","\"[They have] this idea that privacy is something that's quite central, that it could be thought of in terms of if property rights,\" said Indiana University associate professor Scott Shackelford, who teaches cybersecurity law. \"Having privacy be the starting point and carving out free speech.\"","The U.S. does the reverse, Shackelford said. Free speech is paramount, and privacy protections are carved out as exceptions.","\"You can see how both are valid in different ways, but they come to very different policy outcomes for sure,\" he added.","\"The idea in the EU is you should have some control over your information,\" said Henry Farrell, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University. \"There is some variation in enforcement across specific sectors, but basic principles apply for whatever commercial sector you're in, so you don't have the same kind of patchwork of legislation you have in the U.S.\"","Enforcement is getting more consistant","Besides being spread out over a lot of different agencies, enforcement of American privacy laws changes wildly according to who's in office. Those FCC rules concerning ISPs and privacy data? The FCC voted them through at the very end of the Obama administration, last October. With control of the Senate and House, Republicans rolled them back just a few months later.","The EU sees much smaller swings in policy as administrations change, Farrell said, because most member states aren't as polarized as the U.S. Still, enforcement is often a \"black box,\" with inconsistent action from independent regulators. That will change as the new EU regulations roll out, Shackelford added.","\"There is going to be a one-stop-shop, basically kind of one regulator, one supervisory authority for all EU data privacy law,\" he said. \"Which is going to be more efficient from the government perspective in Europe, and also for companies because they only have to deal with one entity across all 28 states. It's really remarkable they were able to agree to that, because that's not the case, for example, of the U.S. And we're one country.\"","Europeans don't sweat the fine print (as much)","We talked a lot on the podcast this week about the huge terms of service and privacy policies most people blindly agree to. Even Reidenberg, the privacy expert, told us he mostly skims when he's signing up for a new service. It's kind of a calculated risk: You kind of have to hope you're not blindly agreeing to tie your hands in a lawsuit or clear all your data to be bought and sold. It's even scarier when you consider apps like Instagram that attract a younger user base.","Europeans have to sign similar stuff, but does it come with the same anxiety?","\"Not nearly the same way, and the reason is European privacy law mandates that businesses basically have to adhere to a sense of basic privacy principles with regards to the way that they use your data,\" Farrell said. \"You know, the fact that there are certain things that they simply cannot do with your data. That is not true for U.S. consumers in the same way at all.\"","Under the EU's new rules, you also have a lot more control over how and when your data moves between services you use.","\"If you switch from the equivalent of Comcast to U-Verse, Comcast has to get rid of all your search history when you switch if you request that,\" Shackelford said. \"So then that's a big deal.\"","Your data expires","Much was made a few years ago about the \"Right to Be Forgotten,\" an idea that lead Spanish authorities and later the European Court of Justice to scrub search results deemed “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed and in the light of the time that has elapsed.” In this case, an old news story about a businessman's debts. That standard opened the floodgates to more requests, and sparked outrage from free speech advocates in the U.S.","The whole affair reaches back to that same idea of a policy \"starting point.\" Many Europeans think of privacy on a \"temporal sliding scale, Shackelford said.","\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 20 years from now, is going to have more privacy rights than she does the day that she leaves office,\" he said. \"That is very different in the U.S. Basically, once you're in the public eye in the U.S., you're always in the public eye, even if it's in an involuntary kind of way.\"","“I think the best compliment I can give is not to say how much your programs have taught me (a ton), but how much Marketplace has motivated me to go out and teach myself.” – Michael in Arlington, VA","As a nonprofit news organization, what matters to us is the same thing that matters to you: being a source for trustworthy, independent news that makes people smarter about business and the economy.

Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn’t disclosed it until now.","The developments are the latest to show how people try to exploit Facebook in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy. Before the Cambridge imbroglio, there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events.","Wylie claimed Cambridge Analytica used the data it had while speaking with Russian businesses. He also said that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, what’s different here is that people wouldn’t know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing and said it deleted all data it received from a contractor after learning the data had been obtained in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of that data was used in its 2016 election work for the “avoidance of doubt.” President Donald Trump’s campaign Saturday denied using the firm’s data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and it’s not clear how the firm targeted people with misinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign. What is clear is that two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center, and about 20 percent do so “often.” While people don’t exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the “rabbit hole” of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.","While Wylie said he doesn’t know whether Trump’s campaign used the techniques, he said Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was meeting with Cambridge Analytica in 2015, before Trump even announced his run for office."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","Originally published on March 16, 2018:We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.","We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies","Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","How Things Have Changed","We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.","In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He had been a strong advocate for an aggressive approach to alleged Russian activity on the platform aimed at manipulating elections. His departure was first reported by the New York Times. Facebook declined immediate comment.","In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change.”","Related Coverage","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","London-based Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","However, further allegations about the firm’s tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery.","Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report “is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”","Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the U.S. Congress after the reports in the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend.","Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.","Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.","Late on Monday, the Connecticut Attorney General said the office will initiate an inquiry into Facebook data policies.","The Senate was expected to move forward on Monday with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking. The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law.","Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing application he had built.","Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved and said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission.","“(Tech companies) are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it,” said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.","‘VERY CONCERNING’","European officials, who have been more willing to regulate Silicon Valley companies than their U.S. counterparts, were strident in criticism of Facebook.","The revelations about Cambridge Analytica were “horrifying, if confirmed,” said EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova. “We don’t want this in the EU and will take all possible legal measures” including stricter rules under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect in May, she said.","A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were “clearly very concerning.”","The head of the European Parliament said EU lawmakers will investigate possible data misuse, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens’ privacy rights.","(This version of the story refiles to fix spell check errors of proper names and ticker symbol)","A 3D-printed Facebook logo are seen in front of displayed binary digits in this illustration taken, March 18, 2018.

We use our own judgement for three categories of metrics: reach, growth and engagement. The three areas are graded and then the platform receives a final, aggregate grade.","Reach","Reach was at 6.38% compared to 7.21% in January. Photo reach was 6.46%, and that’s a drop compared to January’s 7.13%. Links and their reach was 6.46%. It’s not good news for the platform because 7.63% was the figure in January.","Video reach was at 6.02%, which is a drop from the 7.72% in the first month of 2018. And when it comes to status update reach, that was at a low point, coming up as 5.13%. Not good, compared to January’s 5.54%.","12.73% of pages used paid advertising. Back in January, that figure was 17.27%. Paid reach was 37.02% of the total reach, a real explosion when you rack it up against January’s 23.85%. That’s huge, and could possibly have something to do with Zuckerberg’s change of approach that he made public at the start of the year.","Grade: C-","Engagement","Engagement in February stood at 5.75% of the people reached. Back in January it stood at 5.3%.","Videos on the platform engaged 7.49%, a healthy increase compared to the previous month’s 6.96%. When it comes to photo engagement, it was at 5.22%. Back in January 2018, photo engagement was 4.97%. Link engagement was at 4.73%, up on January’s 4.68%. Status update engagement was 4.42%, and in January it was 4.24%.","Grade: A","Growth","Facebook fans growth in February 2018 was at 0.08%, another disappointment compared to January’s 0.09%.","Grade: C+","Overall grade: B","Newsfeed. Gamed","With the rest of the world still reeling from the evil news feed algorithm change that the company introduced, it’s kind of comforting to note that Facebook doesn’t have quite the power we thought it did. Or maybe that’s what Facebook thought it did. Whatever.","The news feed can be gamed. It’s official. A recent post showed that all you have to do, apparently, is the opposite of what Facebook wants you to do. Basically, get a ton of comments and you’ll find your content at the top of everyone’s newsfeed. Not quite what Facebook intended, but this apparently works, just the same.","Now who’s going to tell Mr Zuckerberg?","One step closer to the bottom","For years Facebook users have been asking for a ‘dislike’ button. It’s something a lot of people want, and perhaps it’s the one thing that will change Facebook forever. Being able to dislike stuff as well as like it will give the very last slice of power to users. But Facebook has always said it will not offer the feature, possibly as a result of the company being too nice to dislike anyone.","However, the landscape has just changed a little. For about 5% of Facebook users on Android in the USA only (how’s that for a niche demographic?) there is currently an ability to ‘downvote’ a post. It’s temporary, and is purely a way for Facebook to measure how such an option would work. That’s what Facebook is saying anyway.","The idea is that the downvote will allow people to flag up stuff that isn’t meant to be on a newsfeed, such as fake news or ‘off-topic’ content. But even the least cynical person in the world would agree that this seems to be a step closer to that button that the planet has been waiting years for.","Facebook Live no longer Live","Excuse the subhead there, but there’s been a bit of a problem with what was supposed to be the biggest thing since sliced bread. Facebook Live was once the darling of the company. It was often touted as something that would change the Internet, and it looked like Mark Zuckerberg was fully behind it all the way.","Apparently, Watch, which has a very positive reception whenever anyone brings it up, is what Facebook is now seeing as the Next Big Thing. We don’t know what happened to Live, to be honest. The buzz was all about Live last year, and now it seems to have become suspiciously quiet.","Messenger becomes slightly more annoying?","It’s possible. And recent news seems to back this up. Messenger now has the potential to carry yet another ‘branding message’ weapon for companies.","Messenger Broadcast will allow brands to send out a quick blast to people they have struck up a conversation with on Messenger. It’s advertising, basically, and the concern is that Facebook may be on the verge of making Messenger one big spam folder.","We can see that happening. The one thing Facebook does not do is turn down money. And if brands see Broadcast becoming a paid-for tool, it’s still cheaper and quicker than setting up and running a quality bot. Watch this space, but our money is on Facebook Messenger becoming an ad platform sooner than you might think.","Mark Zuckerberg is (not) going for President","It’s an intriguing thought, but the boss of Facebook has stated that he doesn’t want to run the United States. However, his recent behaviour has brought about a fresh round of speculation on the issue. And what was especially interesting about what happened is the way it illustrated a few things about the founder’s personality.","Facebook hired someone to measure the public image that Zuckerberg has. And when we say ‘Facebook’ we mean Mark Zuckerberg. No one that powerful allows anyone else to decide whether or not his profile is going to be scrutinised and analysed, with a view to looking for faults.","The guy was called Tavis McGinn, and he had worked at Google before. Facebook were originally going to be using him for market research but then he landed the job of monitoring and reporting on Zuckerberg’s online presence and approval ratings. So very similar to someone who is running for public office, but he’s not running for President.","Yet.","And Facebook is aiming at YouTube","The Watch thing strikes again. Facebook wants to ensure that it becomes a rival to YouTube. This is no small desire because YouTube dominates video.","Don’t get too excited just yet. Facebook is currently discussing the possibility of opening up Watch to individuals. As in not doing anything about it. But it’s another expected step for a brand that has the most marketable name in social media. More video watch times, mostly because the users are creating the content, means more advertising. It’s not cynicism, it’s just true.","And finally, Facebook is becoming transparent","Facebook is looking very closely at the way it handles metrics and this suggests that a sea change is on its way. It’s going to get rid of metrics that don’t matter, and offer support to advertisers on how to get the most out of their ad experience.","It all sounds rather pleasant, and it’s proof that Facebook watches its numbers very carefully.The whole thing (probably) came about because brands have expressed a frustration with the numbers Facebook gives out. These brands want transparency, so they can be sure they’re getting more for their money.","If you’d like to get your hands on some amazing metrics that tell you all you need to know about your clients and their position on social, take out a free 7-day trial of Locowise now."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.","Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on US elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, The New York Times reported.","The company, which The New York Times reported was staffed by mostly British workers then, assisted Republican Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign before helping Trump's.","What Does It Do?","Cambridge Analytica markets itself as providing consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.","It does not list its corporate clients but on its website describes them as including a daily newspaper that wanted to know more about its subscribers, a women's clothing brand that sought research on its customers and a US auto insurer interested in marketing itself.","Britain's Channel 4 News reported on Monday, based on a secretly recorded video, that Cambridge Analytica secretly stage-managed Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaigns in the hotly contested 2013 and 2017 elections. Cambridge Analytica denied the report.","The company's website lists five office locations in New York, Washington, London, Brazil and Malaysia.","When Did It First Get Attention?","After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, The Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters, which was a \"secret sauce\" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.","Rival consultants and campaign aides, though, expressed doubts about the company's claims. Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital operations in 2016, said the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's data, relying instead on voter data from a Republican National Committee operation.","What is It Accused Of?","Cambridge Analytica, beginning in 2014, obtained data on 50 million Facebook users via means that deceived both the users and Facebook, The New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday.","The data was harvested by an application developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, the newspapers said. Some 270,000 people downloaded the application and logged in with their Facebook credentials, according to Facebook. The application gathered their data and data about their friends, and then Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, according to both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.","Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it did not initially know Kogan violated Facebook's terms, and that it deleted the data once it found out in 2015. Kogan could not be reached for comment.","The data, though, was not deleted, the two newspapers reported on Saturday. CambridgeAnalytica said that the allegation was not true. Facebook said it was investigating to verify the accuracy of the claim.","What Happens Next?","Facebook said it was pressing Cambridge Analytica for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. Facebook has hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help.","While Facebook investigates, the social network said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent SCL, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, from its platform for violating Facebook rules.","Facebook's probe, though, may have to wait until government authorities complete their investigation. The UK Information Commissioner's Office is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office and asked Facebook's auditors to stand down in the meantime, according to Facebook.","Attorneys generals from the US states of Massachusetts and Connecticut have launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the attorney general's office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns.","(This article has been published in an arrangement with Reuters)","(The Quint has given up the use of plastic plates and spoons in its cafeteria.

And Facebook groups look like they may offer once possibility…","Some time ago, I did a demo of how to map the the common Facebook Likes of my Facebook friends (Social Interest Positioning – Visualising Facebook Friends’ Likes With Data Grabbed Using Google Refine). In part inspired by a conversation today about profiling the interests of members of particular Facebook groups, I thought I’d have a quick peek at the Facebook API to see if it’s possible to grab the membership list of arbitrary, open Facebook groups, and then pull down the list of Likes made by the members of the group.","As with my other social positioning/social interest mapping experiments, the idea behind this approach is broadly this: users express interest through some sort of public action, such as following a particular Twitter account that can be associated with a particular interest. In this case, the signal I’m associating with an expression of interest is a Facebook Like. To locate something in interest space, we need to be able to detect a set of users associated with that thing, identify each of their interests, and then find interests they have in common. These shared interests (ideally over and above a “background level of shared interest”, aka the Stephen Fry effect (from Twitter, where a large number of people in any set of people appear to follow Stephen Fry oblivious of other more pertinent shared interests that are peculiar to that set of people) are then assumed to be representative of the interests associated with the thing. In this case, the thing is a Facebook group, the users associated with the thing are the group members, and the interests associated with the thing are the things commonly liked by members of the group.","Simples.","So for example, here is the social interest positioning of the Red Bull Racing group on Facebook, based on a sample of 3000 members of the group. Note that a significant number of these members returned no likes, either because they haven’t liked anything, or because their personal privacy settings are such that they do not publicly share their likes.","As we might expect, the members of this group also appear to have an interest in other Formula One related topics, from F1 in general, to various F1 teams and drivers, and to motorsport and motoring in general (top half of the map). We also find music preferences (the cluster to the left of the map) and TV programmes (centre bottom of the map) that are of common interest, though I have no idea yet whether these are background radiation interests (that is, the Facebook equivalent of the Stephen Fry effect on Twitter) or are peculiar to this group. I’m not sure whether the cluster of beverage related preferences at the bottom right corner of the map is notable either?","#This is a really simple script:\n##Grab the list of members of a Facebook group (no paging as yet...)\n###For each member, try to grab their Likes\nimport urllib,simplejson,csv,argparse\n#Grab a copy of a current token from an example Facebook API call, eg from clicking a keyed link on:\n#https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/examples/\n#Something a bit like this:\n#AAAAAAITEghMBAOMYrWLBTYpf9ciZBLXaw56uOt2huS7C4cCiOiegEZBeiZB1N4ZCqHgQZDZD\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Generate social positioning map around a Facebook group')\nparser.add_argument('-gid',default='2311573955',help='Facebook group ID')\n#gid='2311573955'\nparser.add_argument('-FBTOKEN',help='Facebook API token')\nargs=parser.parse_args()\nif args.gid!=None: gid=args.gid\nif args.FBTOKEN!=None: FBTOKEN=args.FBTOKEN\n#Quick test - output file is simple 2 column CSV that we can render in Gephi\nfn='fbgroupliketest_'+str(gid)+'.csv'\nwriter=csv.writer(open(fn,'wb+'),quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)\nuids=[]\ndef getGroupMembers(gid):\ngurl='https://graph.facebook.com/'+str(gid)+'/members?limit=5000&access_token='+FBTOKEN\ndata=simplejson.load(urllib.urlopen(gurl))\nif \"error\" in data:\nprint \"Something seems to be going wrong - check OAUTH key?\"\nprint data['error']['message'],data['error']['code'],data['error']['type']\nexit(-1)\nelse:\nreturn data\n#Grab the likes for a particular Facebook user by Facebook User ID\ndef getLikes(uid,gid):\n#Should probably implement at least a simple cache here\nlurl=\"https://graph.facebook.com/\"+str(uid)+\"/likes?access_token=\"+FBTOKEN\nldata=simplejson.load(urllib.urlopen(lurl))\nprint ldata\nif len(ldata['data'])>0:\nfor i in ldata['data']:\nif 'name' in i:\nwriter.writerow([str(uid),i['name'].encode('ascii','ignore')])\n#We could colour nodes based on category, etc, though would require richer output format.\n#In the past, I have used the networkx library to construct \"native\" graph based representations of interest networks.\nif 'category' in i:\nprint str(uid),i['name'],i['category']\n#For each user in the group membership list, get their likes\ndef parseGroupMembers(groupData,gid):\nfor user in groupData['data']:\nuid=user['id']\nwriter.writerow([str(uid),str(gid)])\n#x is just a fudge used in progress reporting\nx=0\n#Prevent duplicate fetches\nif uid not in uids:\ngetLikes(user['id'],gid)\nuids.append(uid)\n#Really crude progress reporting\nprint x\nx=x+1\n#need to handle paging?\n#parse next page URL and recall this function\ngroupdata=getGroupMembers(gid)\nparseGroupMembers(groupdata,gid)","Note that I have no idea whether or not this is in breach of Facebook API terms and conditions, nor have I reflected on the ethical implications of running this sort of analysis, over and the above remarking that it’s the same general approach I apply to mapping social interests on Twitter.","As to where next with this? It brings into focus again the question of identifying common interests pertinent to this particular group, compared to background popular interest that might be expressed by any random set of people. But having got a new set of data to play with, it will perhaps make it easier to test the generalisability of any model or technique I do come up with for filtering out, or normalising against, background interest.","Other directions this could go? Using a single group to bootstrap a walk around the interest space? For example, in the above case, trying to identify groups associated with Sebastian Vettel, or F1, and then repeating the process? It might also make sense to look at the categories of the notable shared interests; (from a quick browse, these include, for example, things like Movie, Product/service, Public figure, Games/toys, Sports Company, Athlete, Interest, Sport; is there a full vocabulary available, I wonder? How might we use this information?)","Rate this:","Share this:","Like this:","Related","2 comments","First of all, I become here to learn a bit more about Google Refine. Thank you for writing such things so others can learn more about this revolutionary software.\nI was introduced to it few weeks ago and since then I just can´t stop wondering how powerful it is, and I had success grabbing and extracting information about the presence of health units here in Brazil.\nWhat you write here in this post is exactly what I´ve been thinking for the last three weeks. As a statistician, I have a lot of interest in the profiling theme. Facebook ant Tweeter, as the main sites in entertainment industry, for example are a treasure mine for those who would like to study how human behavior in consumption variates.\nYour example, pointing the comparison between interests associated with Red Bull and those in general is great. How would you test that, statiscally speaking?\nAnd there´s another great app from google: google fusion. Till today, I didn´t knew Gephi, but started with the Network Graph in fusion. It can give clusters in data real quick and I think is good for keyword analysis too.\nI really appreciate if you could give some links to learn about the facebook API with practical examples in data grabbing the way you did.\nKeep walking, my friend.

{"originalurl":"https://webkit.org/blog/8146/protecting-against-hsts-abuse/","title":"Protecting Against HSTS Abuse | WebKit","text":["HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security standard that provides a mechanism for web sites to declare themselves accessible only via secure connections, and to tell web browsers where to go to get that secure version. Web browsers that honor the HSTS standard also prevent users from ignoring server certificate errors.","Apple uses HSTS on iCloud.com, for example, so that any time a visitor attempts to navigate to the insecure address “http://www.icloud.com” either by typing that web address, or clicking on a link, they will be automatically redirected to “https://www.icloud.com”. HSTS will also cause the web browser to go to the secure site in the future, even if the insecure address is used. This is a great feature that prevents a simple error from placing users in a dangerous state, such as performing financial transactions over an unauthenticated connection.","What could be wrong with that?","Well, the HSTS standard describes that web browsers should remember when redirected to a secure location, and to automatically make that conversion on behalf of the user if they attempt an insecure connection in the future. This creates information that can be stored on the user’s device and referenced later. And this can be used to create a “super cookie” that can be read by cross-site trackers.","HSTS as a Persistent Cross-Site Identifier (aka “Super Cookie”)","An attacker seeking to track site visitors can take advantage of the user’s HSTS cache to store one bit of information on that user’s device. For example, “load this domain with HTTPS” could represent a 1, while no entry in the HSTS cache would represent a 0. By registering some large number of domains (e.g., 32 or more), and forcing resource loads from a controlled subset of those domains, they can create a large enough vector of bits to uniquely represent each site visitor.","…it is possible for those who control one or more HSTS Hosts to encode information into domain names they control and cause such UAs to cache this information as a matter of course in the process of noting the HSTS Host. This information can be retrieved by other hosts through cleverly constructed and loaded web resources, causing the UA to send queries to (variations of) the encoded domain names.","On the initial website visit:","A random number is assigned to the visitor, for example 8396804.","This can be represented as a binary value (e.g., 100000000010000000000100)","The tracker script then makes subresource requests to a tracker-controlled domain over https, one request per active bit in the tracking identifier.","https://bit02.example.com","https://bit13.example.com","https://bit23.example.com","… and so on.","The server responds to each HTTPS request with an HSTS response header, which caches the tracking value in the web browser.","Now we are guaranteed to load the HTTPS version of bit02.example.com, bit13.example.com, and bit23.example.com, even if the load is attempted over HTTP.","On subsequent website visits:","The tracker script loads 32 invisible pixels over HTTP that represent the bits in the binary number.","Since some of those bits (bit02.example.com, bit13.example.com, and bit23.example.com in our example) were loaded with HSTS, they will automatically be redirected to HTTPS.","The tracking server transmits one image when they are requested over HTTP, and a different image when requested over HTTPS.","The tracking script recognizes the different images, turns those into zero (HTTP) and one (HTTPS) bits in the number, and voila — your unique binary value is recreated and you are tracked!","Attempts to mitigate this attack are challenging because of the difficulty in balancing security and privacy goals. Improperly mitigating the attack also runs the risk of weakening important security protections.","Challenges","Periodically, the privacy risks of HSTS are discussed in the media as a theoretical tracking vector (e.g., [1], [2], and [3]). Absent evidence of actual malicious abuse of the HSTS protocol, browser implementors erred on the side of caution and honored all HSTS instructions provided by sites.","Recently we became aware that this theoretical attack was beginning to be deployed against Safari users. We therefore developed a balanced solution that protects secure web traffic while mitigating tracking.","Apple’s Solution","The HSTS exploit consists of two phases: the initial tracking identifier creation phase, and the subsequent read operation. We decided to apply mitigations to both sides of the attack.","Mitigation 1: Limit HSTS State to the Hostname, or the Top Level Domain + 1","We observed tracking sites constructing long URL’s encoding the digits in various levels of the domain name.","Telemetry showed that attackers would set HSTS across a wide range of sub-domains at once. Because using HSTS in this way does not benefit legitimate use cases, but does facilitate tracking, we revised our network stack to only permit HSTS state to be set for the loaded hostname (e.g., “https://a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.example.com”), or the Top Level Domain + 1 (TLD+1) (e.g., “https://example.com”).","This prevents trackers from efficiently setting HSTS across large numbers of different bits; instead, they must individually visit each domain representing an active bit in the tracking identifier. While content providers and advertisers may judge that the latency introduced by a single redirect through one origin to set many bits is imperceptible to a user, requiring redirects to 32 or more domains to set the bits of the identifier would be perceptible to the user and thus unacceptable to them and content providers. WebKit also caps the number of redirects that can be chained together, which places an upper bound on the number of bits that can be set, even if the latency was judged to be acceptable.","We modified WebKit so that when an insecure third-party subresource load from a domain for which we block cookies (such as an invisible tracking pixel) had been upgraded to an authenticated connection because of dynamic HSTS, we ignore the HSTS upgrade request and just use the original URL. This causes HSTS super cookies to become a bit string consisting only of zeroes.","Conclusion","Telemetry gathered during internal regression testing, our public seeds, and the final public software release indicates that the two mitigations described above successfully prevented the creation and reading of HSTS super cookies while not regressing the security goals of first party content. We believe them to be consistent with best practices, and to maintain the important security protections provided by HSTS. We have shared the details of Mitigation 1 with the authors of RFC 6797, and are working to incorporate the behavior as part of the standard.","However, the internet is a wide space full of unique and amazing uses of Web Technology. If you feel that you have a legitimate case where these new rules are not working as intended, we would like to know about it. Please send feedback and questions to web-evangelist@apple.com or @webkit on Twitter, and file any bugs that you run into on WebKit’s bug tracker."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Related Coverage","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted.”","FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is seen at the Facebook Gather conference in Brussels, Belgium January 23, 2018.

{"originalurl":"https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/all-the-ways-facebook-tracks-you-that-you-might-not-kno-1795604150","title":"You Probably Don’t Know All the Ways Facebook Tracks You","text":["We’re all aware of the deal we make when we sign up with Facebook: we get somewhere to post vacation photos and stalk friends, and Mark Zuckerberg gets to sell your passion for fishing trips to fishing equipment retailers. What you might not realize is how deep or extensive the tracking goes—so let’s shed some light on it.","All of this is well within Facebook’s remit. You’re using its services and, per its privacy policy, it can do what it likes with the data you hand over: Facebook’s full privacy policy is here. There are some ways to limit the reach of Facebook’s data-sucking tentacles (and we’ll go through them below), but ultimately the only way to really get back all of your privacy is to delete your account.","Advertisement","Some of the relationship between your actions of Facebook and how Facebook uses those actions for financial gain is immediately obvious: like a page on Coke, and you see more adverts for the fizzy beverage. But less obvious are the ways Facebook joins the dots between the data points it collects, building up a picture of who you are and what you might be interested in—whether or not it’s 100 percent accurate doesn’t really matter, because it can still sell targeted adverts at a higher rate.","“﻿Everything people do, either on Facebook directly or on sites that have a Facebook ‘Like’ button, reveals information about them to Facebook.”","“Even if people are aware of what data they’re telling Facebook about themselves, they’re unaware about the types of correlations that Facebook can make based on that data,” Bruce Schneier, a security expert and fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center, told Gizmodo. “This is normal—we tend to focus on the data collection because that’s easier to see. I think the real problem are the correlations, which are much harder to see.”","Advertisement","Take Facebook’s 2014 analysis of which users are in relationships, even if it’s not declared on their profiles. The way your posting frequency sheds light on your life is one of the correlations that Facebook can use—and this was three years ago! The data in the experiment was aggregated and anonymized, Facebook says, but it shows the reach of Facebook’s digital surveillance apparatus. If you want an idea on how Facebook perceives your online behavior and transforms it into tailored advertisements log into the site and visit your Ad Preferences page.","“Everything people do, either on Facebook directly or on sites that have a Facebook ‘Like’ button, reveals information about them to Facebook,” adds Schneier. “That’s an important point: Facebook tracks you even when you’re not on Facebook, because of their extensive surveillance network on sites that link to them.”","The big reveal","Image: Facebook","Advertisement","Even if you’re careful about the advertisers and businesses you interact with on Facebook, the social network’s range of technologies mean it’s very hard to stay completely untracked as you move about the web.","Load up Facebook’s ad policy page and you can learn about some of the ways you might be exposing yourself to eager advertisers—Facebook knows when you share information with a business, sign up for a loyalty program, or even add items to a shopping cart that you then never purchase.","As Facebook’s algorithms get smarter, its automated tracking gets smarter too. For example, facial recognition is a handy little AI trick you can use when you want to call up all the pictures you and your best buddy have been in together, but it also means Facebook can now recognize you in photos without you actually having to go to the trouble of tagging yourself, something that’s got the platform into hot water in Europe.","Advertisement","“As images are posted and you are tagged... facial recognition is continually refined,” Craig Spiezle, Chairman of the Online Trust Allowance, told Gizmodo. “Do users understand the implications? For example if there is a group photo of a project or an event, you may automatically be recognized and tagged.”","“Settings can be complex and while I think [Facebook] does try to provide notices on changes, I believe the typical user ignores it,” adds Spiezle, saying that while these tracking features can be disabled in certain cases, “these all come with a trade off to the user experience” on the network. Which means in order to enjoy the full benefit of what Facebook potentially has to offer you also have to give away much of your privacy.","Image: Screenshot","Advertisement","Facebook isn’t the only company working on facial recognition and it’s not the only company that has to answer questions about how this automated scanning could be used to track us in the physical world when we’re not even aware of it. There are plenty more examples of how Facebook adds to its user profiles too:","Where you’re going: The big data point Facebook gets when you install its mobile applications is where you are every second of the day. This gives it information on the bands you like seeing, the tourist spots you enjoy, and even the individual stores you walk into. If you’re not happy with this, you can revoke these permissions on Android and iOS.","The websites you visit: So many websites and third-party services use Facebook technologies, from Like buttons to login options, that Facebook has a pretty good idea of what you’re up to when you’re not actually on Facebook. If you want to limit how this data can be collected and used, then you need to do some tidying up in your Facebook settings.","Your financial status: Even if you never post about your money worries (or joys) on Facebook, it can still build up a fairly good assessment of your financial position to sell on to advertisers. How? By combining data points like your online purchases and where you live, together with records provided by its marketing partners from various sources.","Status updates you almost post: Facebook can tell when you’re about to write something and then think better of it, as per a 2012 research paper (though the contents of your self-censored musings aren’t logged). If you’re thinking of making a drunken boast or a barbed comment and then think better of it, Facebook sees your indecisiveness.","Apps you install: It’s not just Facebook’s privacy policy you need to worry about, but also how third-party apps are using your data—while a Facebook quiz may seem innocuous, telling the world which bands you’ve seen gives another data point to advertisers. Pay close attention to the permissions apps ask for and remove the ones you don’t need.","Apps your friends install: Bad news—apps your dimwitted friends install can gather information you’re sharing with them too. To limit this, go to the Apps section of Settings on Facebook, click Edit under Apps others use, and then untick all the categories of information you’re not comfortable sharing. Alternatively, unfriend the worst offenders.","When you’re feeling low: Another trick Facebook’s algorithms can do is make a pretty good guess about when you’re at a low ebb. This is one of the data points Facebook promises it isn’t selling on to advertisers, but it’s a sign of the way all these various social media signals can be combined together to make some revealing conclusions about you.","Do you know where your data is?","Image: Facebook","Facebook sees everything you do on the platform, though it does offer a decent amount of control over who else can see your posts and who can’t. Sometimes, however, these lines aren’t as clearly marked as you might think—and with a little bit of expert know-how, other people can dig deeper into your profile than you might like.","Advertisement","Michael Bazzell collects publicly available online data for his job as a security expert (he’s served as a technical advisor on Mr. Robot), and was able to show us how to check on the big information you might be revealing without knowing it. First, head here, click the Facebook link on the left side of the page, and enter your username into the FB User Name field to get your profile number (a long series of digits). Log into Facebook and try any of the following URLs to see what you (or your friends have been) up to.","You can pick up data here that’s not necessarily available through your profile and can even in some cases be seen by people who you’re not friends with on Facebook, as long as the posts are public (here’s where Mark Zuckerberg’s been checking in). If other people can uncover these sorts of results with a few clicks, imagine what’s going on deep within Facebook’s servers.","Advertisement","“The examples above were done legally and within the intention of Facebook’s search,” Bazzell—who doesn’t post anything on Facebook—told us. “There was nothing shady. I only pulled publicly available details.”","“My view is that anything posted to a social network is public data, regardless of the privacy settings. I don’t blame Facebook, I blame all of us for not investigating the companies that want our data. Facebook does not charge its users for access, yet makes billions of dollars. The users are the product.”","It’s up to you whether you find the services of Facebook (or Google or Apple or Amazon) useful enough to be worth the privacy trade-off—but what’s certain is we’re in a new age of data tracking, one that goes way beyond the information we’re actually aware that we’re sharing."],"isopubdate":"2026-11-25"}

He also addressed the longstanding internet theory that Facebook spies on its users to shape their advertising.","Last year, a YouTube video of a man claiming Facebook gave him cat food ads because of a conversation with his girlfriend went viral. And the eavesdropping claims are regularly discussed on social media.","Conservative MP Damian Collins, who chaired the committee, asked Wylie if the rumours are true.","“There’s been various speculation about the fact that Facebook can, through the Facebook app on your smartphone, listen in to what people are talking about and discussing and using that to prioritize the advertising as well,” Collins said. “Other people would say, no, they don’t think it’s possible. It’s just that the Facebook system is just so good at predicting what you’re interested in that it can guess.”","Wylie said that he was only speculating, but that Facebook and other apps can listen in and figure out the context of where you are based on the sounds in your environment. It picks up whether your TV is on, or if you’re at work or at home based on “environmental context,” he said.","“There’s audio that could be useful just in terms of, are you in an office environment, are you outside, are you watching TV, what are you doing right now?” Wylie said.","But this data is used to target ads based on your location, not listen to your conversations, he explained.","“It’s not to say they’re listening to what you’re saying. It’s not natural language processing. That would be hard to scale. But to understand the environmental context of where you are to improve the contextual value of the ad,” he said.","Wylie emphasized that it would be a better question for Facebook.","The social media giant has repeatedly denied using people’s microphones to target ads or tailor users’ news feeds.","“Facebook does not use your phone’s microphone to inform ads or to change what you see in News Feed,” Facebook said in a statement in 2016. “Articles have suggested that we must be listening to people’s conversations in order to show them relevant ads.

A few days ago, another story broke on their clumsy utilisation of a deprecated Android API to collect a history of the recipients of all SMS messages and phone calls on Android devices that had the Facebook or Messenger app installed to feed the algorithms managing friends suggestions.","The reactions","Tim Cook intervened calling for clear rules, processes and structures to safeguard personal information and limit the reach of advertisement companies, political parties and many other agencies that have the tools to “connect the dots” and use data to their advantage.\nDespite Tim Cook’s numerous remarks and pride for Apple’s commitment to privacy and their laudable on-device approach, to retain their ability to do commerce in China, Apple recently transferred all cloud data belonging to its Chinese users to servers based in China, allowing for much easier government access.","Whilst I am sure that this conversation will be beneficial in creating a more structured system to protect our information (and the GDPR is a good stepping stone), I believe it is necessary for each of us to be conscious of the mechanisms underlying the internet, the concept of audience, the potential eternity of data shared online, the way our devices interact and the technologies involved.","This requires a combined effort of companies, policy makers, agencies and governments, but hopefully it will also be something that education systems will be called to cover in the near future.","However, there are some small steps that everyone can take to limit the amount of information online companies can use to profile people. It was estimated that Google (through the Analytics script, AdSense, in-browser predictive systems, auto-suggest, etc.) can track around 80% of an average browsing session. Facebook as well (through Pixel, Graph APIs and other forms of presence such as comment box scripts, like button, embedded posts, etc) can track a vast portion of your online behaviour outside its domains.","As you can imagine, mixing almost all of your browsing history with the information that you spontaneously submit in your wall or with your likes, gives these online companies (and others, as we saw with Cambridge Analytica) a scary amount of information about you. This specific case regarding US elections and Brexit has various implications regarding the role of democracy, the power of information and mechanisms of governmentality – but it is something too big to squeeze in this article.","How can we defend ourselves?","What can you do to limit this? Allegedly many people are taking the drastic decision of deleting their Facebook profile (the #deletefacebook hashtag was trending a few days ago, Elon Musk also chipped in). Whilst removing your account will certainly do something, there are other ways by which companies like Google and Facebook can track your online activities (take a look here and here).","In some small way – without the need to buy a new device every day, fake your MAC address or stop using GPS altogether – there are things we could do to make life harder to people that want to track our behaviour across devices and sessions and be more conservative with our data.","I have compiled a list of things that I have done and that hopefully will be useful to you:","Set DuckDuckGo as my default search engine in Chrome and Safari Mobile","Use the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA)’s site YourOnlineChoices to control the cookies currently stored by ad companies","Set Chrome to delete all of my cookies upon exit (except a few trusted domains that I have whitelisted for convenience) and use 1Password (with the standard browser extension or the new 1Password X for Chrome) to fill login boxes","Use a trusted VPN whenever possible (my personal one if I am doing something very sensitive, a trusted commercial one any other time as for energy saving purposes iOS heavily limits on-demand IPSec VPNs and automatically disconnects from them after a few seconds of inactivity)","Review the apps for which I granted permissions on Facebook –\nremoved as many as possible. Also reviewed my Facebook profile to show nothing more than my profile picture and cover photo to anyone that is not my friend (and hide my friends list to anyone).","Gradually change all the emails I am registered with on online services so that in each site I am using a unique address. Comparing and matching emails is a very convenient method for companies to track users across sites. With Gmail you can easily create a unique email for each service with the + trick. For example, I would use [email protected]__ for Facebook, [email protected]__ for Airbnb, etc. If you don’t know what I am talking about, you can learn more here.","Do you have any more ideas on ways to limit our traceability on the internet?

And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.","Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.","Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\"","Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.","In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted all of it.","Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act \"and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.","Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.","The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","And yet as the firm sought to build \"psychographic profiles\" to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Credit: via Wikimedia Commons","Apple defies industry logic.","Apple is the only major tech company with a default assumption that consumers don't want to be tracked or targeted across the web. Its leaders convey a belief that your data is your data until you say otherwise. In a world where data has been called the \"new oil,\" how does Apple side with privacy and stay so rich?","Cynics argue that it's because Apple depends less on advertising and commerce. I say it's a benefit of Apple's strategic decision to build trust with its customers.","If you work in digital media, you need to know that the industry is one year from taking a big step toward Apple's view. No, this isn't a case of digital disruption coming (once again) from Silicon Valley. In this case, the seismic shift originates in the European Union. Much of the digital media industry is likely to panic over the coming months. But mark my words: The EU will ultimately lead publishers and advertisers to a better place.","The most significant change to data privacy regulation in more than two decades will go into effect on May 25, 2018. Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR (a mouthful, I know), any company will need to ask for explicit consumer consent to collect and use data across the web and app ecosystem. The GDPR has been described as a new gold standard globally and \"extraterritorial\" in that it applies to any company that touches personal data of EU citizens -- so everyone needs to pay attention.","And the GDPR has teeth: It will prescribe fines equal up to a whopping 4% of global revenue. To put this in perspective, Facebook's fine last week of $130 million (for providing misleading information about its WhatsApp acquisition) could have amounted to more than $1 billion if it happened under these new rules. Amid our industry's uproar over the digital advertising \"duopoly\" of Google and Facebook, Europe should be applauded for writing the first law that, as a byproduct, may actually change how those companies do business.","Though research earlier this year showed that Republicans and Democrats both overwhelmingly supported preserving the FCC's privacy rules for browser histories and other matters, Congress gutted the rules anyway and rapidly heard from their constituents. This may be part of the reason we're seeing regulation at the state level and new bills out of GOP leadership. Bottom-line: People want simple and effective ways to prevent companies from tracking everything they do on their phones and browsers. In fact, 92% of consumers say they don't want their browsing data sold or shared without permission. Just ask yourself, would you?","The impact on advertisers is a bit more complex\nDigital is still mostly a direct-marketing business where advertising is bought at minimal risk, optimized with performance guarantees and targeting to the best audience possible at the lowest possible price. These are the classic rules of direct marketing. And to do it, unsurprisingly, advertisers prefer zero limits on how they can mine and use data across the internet. Trade lobbies like the Direct Marketer Association are happy to explain that more access to your browser data means more relevant ads for you. So, of course, they are concerned about GDPR.","Two other significant advertising trends are happening, though, which suggest that these new rules may ultimately benefit advertisers.","First, advertisers have peeled back the onion on transparency to see what is really happening in programmatic. And they've learned that intermediaries are often using advertisers' data -- and often their purchasing power -- to benefit their own interests. Economists at Carnegie-Mellon have demonstrated that without privacy rules, intermediaries' interests don't align with the advertising firms that they are supposed to represent. \"We find that a strategic intermediary may choose to share with advertising firms only a subset of consumer data,\" they concluded, \"maximizing its profits at their cost.\"","Second, brand advertising -- in which advertisers typically care about the context and use emotion and art to create desire and demand -- is shifting towards digital. This trend is gaining momentum as TV and magazine audiences, the historical venues for brand advertising, begin to decline. But again, there is significant research that brand advertising often fails when solely dependent on targeting. Don Marti has done significant work in pulling together this research.","Think ofthe publishers\nThey are, of course, closest to my well-disclosed interests as I lead a group that represents them. No doubt we've thoroughly documented the significance of the control by the duopoly, particularly as it relates to data collection. Unfortunately, the industry continues to do exactly what the duopoly and ad tech lobbyists demand: We are all complicit in protecting their ability to vacuum data across the web. Allowing the market to enable more and more data collection by third parties hurts us all.","Three years ago, I walked through the math on how behavioral targeted advertising is immaterial to publishers in light of solving for bigger issues. Previously, many argued that multi-site behavioral ads were critically important to the funding of high-quality news and entertainment. What we discovered, however, is that these types of ads that collect data across the web were only responsible for approximately three to four percent of publisher revenue.","Though open exchanges increasingly take a share by selling surplus inventory, they're also being used as a tool to find audiences at the lowest price available -- significantly cheaper than anything relying upon a publisher directly. And what's worse, they often do so by using the high-quality publisher's brand and audience for a single instance to collect data and retarget in worse contexts for brands. With the addition of header bidding tech, that data can often be collected without even making the winning bid.","Think about this for a second: Publishers are allowing ad-tech companies to collect their audience's data and browsing history only to sell ads to these users elsewhere. Publishers also let Facebook (and now Twitter) do this by collecting data whenever Like (or Tweet) buttons show up on any page. Did a publisher ever intend for their audience's entire browsing history to be available to Facebook? I doubt it. But that's what they've granted Facebook in pursuit of Likes.","This time next year the GDPR will go into effect and things will inevitably change. The application of this regulation is also likely to eliminate current friction (goodbye to awful EU cookie notices) and offer easy ways to turn consent on or off using long-defined but mostly ignored Do Not Track signals.","These are positive developments that put the consumer first and increase trust. But importantly, the GDPR also solves an issue for advertisers and publishers by making intermediaries truly accountable to publishers' customers: advertisers and consumers. As long as the EU doesn't bend to the demands of the powerful platforms, the new privacy rules could actually breathe life and energy back into the economics of the publishing business. Apple wouldn't be surprised.","Most Popular","In this article:","Jason Kint","Jason Kint is the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade association for digital content companies.

Security Council sanctions aimed at drying up resources for Pyongyang’s weapons programs, and upset Washington.","Later on Wednesday, Moon’s delegation is scheduled to tour the Mansudae Art Studio, the North’s largest producer of art and propaganda, which was sanctioned by the United Nations last year.","The two Koreas also agreed to pursue a bid to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympic Games, and actively work together in other international competitions including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.","They also adopted a separate military accord aimed at preventing armed clashes between the old foes, which are technically still at war because the Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.","The neighbors will gradually withdraw guard posts and equipment in a move to transform the world’s most heavily fortified border into a no-weapons area, the agreement said.","Later on Wednesday, Moon is scheduled to watch the North’s signature “Brilliant Fatherland” Mass Game, with a formation of glowing drones, lasers and stadium-sized gymnastics shows designed to glorify the country.","Slideshow (19 Images)","On Thursday, the last day of his three-day visit, Moon plans to visit Mount Baektu in North Korea with Kim before returning home.","North Korea says Kim’s grandfather and father were born at Mount Baektu, a centerpiece of the North’s idolization and propaganda campaign to highlight the ruling family’s sacred bloodline.","Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

Let’s work together to keep the conversation civil.","The long-awaited criminal trial for the murder of environmental activist Berta Cáceres sputtered to a halt before it could begin this week, underscoring the prevalence of violence against environmental defenders and widespread impunity across Latin America.","Her trial – set to take place more than two-and-a-half years after her death, and amid accusations of Honduran officials withholding evidence – stands out for its mere existence. Here in one of the world’s most dangerous places for environmental defenders, their murders rarely result in anyone being held accountable, observers say.","But the hearings were thrown off course by a series of appeals filed by the victim’s family’s lawyers, who say the three judges overseeing the case should be replaced. The appeals could delay the case for days – or possibly months – but Cáceres’ family say it is the only way to ensure true justice for the victim and her accused killers. Given how high-profile the case is, the government is under pressure to hold a trial. But rather than go through the motions of accountability, supporters say they want to see justice carried out to the letter of the law.","Ms. Cáceres was one of the most well-known activists in the region, receiving the prestigious Goldman Prize in 2015 after speaking out for decades about indigenous and women’s rights, in addition to the environment. She and the Civic Council of Indigenous and Popular Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) protested the internationally financed Agua Zarca hydrodam. After years of intimidation, detentions, and killings of protesters who opposed the 21-megawat dam, Cáceres had long predicted she would be murdered.","Colleagues in COPINH and her family say they want to ensure her death isn’t just one more on the long tally sheet of environmental activist murders, which added up to 200 people worldwide in 2016 alone. That means not only continuing to fight for the protection of land from lucrative megaprojects and extractive industries, but pushing to set an example of justice for activists under threat around the world.","Berta’s murder “is a message [from the government] for all other defenders of life, the environment, diversity, youth, and women to make them afraid,” says Rodil Vásquez, one of the lawyers representing Cáceres’ mother and four children. “We are trying to create a precedent” of demanding justice.","Those who coordinated and carried out the assassination “probably imagined that two days or two weeks [after her murder] the scandal would stop. They didn’t imagine this strong network, two years later, still insisting on justice for Berta Cáceres,” says Laura Zúñiga Cáceres, the slain activist’s youngest daughter.","‘EFFECTIVE IMPUNITY’","This week, Honduras’ supreme court indefinitely suspended the trial of eight men accused of murdering Cáceres on the night of March 2, 2016, in her home in the mountain town of La Esperanza. Despite efforts by her family’s legal team, the case was to be limited to events taking place the day of the murder, excluding evidence that could show how the assassination was planned out, who conceived the idea, or who hired hitmen, not just those who allegedly pulled the trigger.","A 2017 report published by a panel of independent lawyers with experience in human rights law and prosecuting war crimes found that the company behind the dam was linked to Cáceres’ murder, and that the district attorney’s office had enough evidence to arrest company executives, but had failed to do so.","Demand for natural resources has gone up over the past decade, which makes defending the environment even riskier, says John Knox, who served as the United Nations’ first special rapporteur on human rights and the environment for six years, until stepping down in July.","“There are three overarching factors” that put environmental activists at risk globally, Mr. Knox says. There’s more competition for natural resources; communities in remote areas where those resources are found are often already marginalized, without power in business or government; and, perhaps most importantly, there’s often an absence of the rule of law.","“When you have effective impunity, like the absence of prosecution or other kinds of consequences for harassing or killing environmental defenders – that’s when you see these incredibly large numbers of cases,” he says.","The Agua Zarca dam project that Cáceres organized against was to be built along the Gualcarque River. The surrounding indigenous Lenca communities, who consider the river sacred, feared the effects on their land. The project was licensed without prior consultation of the communities, which is required under Honduran law. The message of Cáceres’s movement gained traction – so much that lenders pulled out of the project. In 2013, the president of the country’s private business council said Cáceres’ efforts were “making Honduras look bad” on the international stage.","CEMENTING A LEGACY","Ms. Zúñiga Cáceres sways back and forth in her chair after a long day of pre-trial meetings.","We’ve pursued this case “not just for Honduras, but the entire region,” she says. “If there’s impunity [in my mother’s case], that means there will be more violence. It will be a message that they can touch whomever they want and nothing will happen.","“We are fighting to guarantee that this won’t happen again.”","From the beginning, Cáceres’ family and COPINH colleagues campaigned for an independent investigation into her killing carried out by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, but the Honduran government rejected the proposal. As the court date neared, key witnesses and evidence in support of the family’s case were repeatedly rejected.","They have asked for the three judges hearing the case to recuse themselves and for the trial to take place in a venue that can guarantee the impartiality of justice promised under Honduran law.","“This case is unique in that it is actually both unique and representative,” says Roxanna Altholz, a University of California, Berkeley law professor and member of the independent panel that published the 2017 report on Cáceres’ death.","It’s very common to be killed for environmental activism, especially in Latin America. But she says it’s unusual for a legal team to have access to evidence like cell phone records, which have been available in this investigation due to a Honduran constitutional law. That data helped paint a picture of the long-term planning involved in Cáceres’ murder, according to the independent report – including an aborted murder attempt weeks prior to her death.","The court ruled most of that evidence inadmissible in the trial, another aspect the family’s legal team is fighting.","“I didn’t have the opportunity to meet Berta Cáceres, but one reason I joined the team is I felt if she could be murdered with impunity then anyone doing this kind of human rights work is vulnerable,” says Dr. Altholz. “It’s amazing, these individuals [accused of her murder] were having conversations via WhatsApp about what they were doing.","“That signals a certainty that they were never going to be held accountable.”","LONDON, Sep 18 (IPS) – Carl Soderbergh is Director of Policy & Communications, Minority Rights Group InternationalMigration has become a focus of debate in recent years. From United States President Donald Trump’s vehemently anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric to Denmark’s new ‘ghetto laws’, the language has become increasingly heated.","Migrant workers – Russia","The Danish government adopted these measures in 2018, specifically targeting low-income immigrant districts and including compulsory education on ‘Danish values’ for children starting at the age of one. In the United Kingdom, while still Home Secretary, Prime Minister Theresa May instituted a ‘hostile environment’ policy in 2012 that was intended to catch undocumented migrants whenever they came into contact with public services.","The policy particularly affected members of the so-called ‘Windrush generation’, the tens of thousands of Afro-Caribbean men, women and children who came over to the UK after World War Two and settled there legally. It is thought that the number of those deported runs into the hundreds, while many thousands more have had to live for several years in considerable uncertainty.","While a public outcry led to an official apology by the UK government, other leaders and governments have been resolutely unapologetic. Indeed, Trump’s travel ban for citizens of several Muslim-majority countries was approved as constitutional by the US Supreme Court in June 2018.","Such policies – and the often vitriolic language accompanying them – have had a direct and negative impact on migrant and refugee communities. According to data released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the annual number of hate crimes against US Muslims recorded by the organization rose 15 per cent in 2017, following on from a 44 per cent increase the previous year – an increase it attributed in part to Trump’s divisive language and the discriminatory measures put forward by his administration.","Muslim woman – ThailandA Thai policeman checks the papers of a Muslim woman at a checkpoint in Pattani.","On 11 September 2018, Minority Rights Group International launched its annual Minority and Indigenous Trends report by hosting a seminar for journalists in Krakow, Poland. This year, we focused the report on migration and displacement. We chose the theme for two reasons.","One is what I have outlined above – the casual disregard that we have repeatedly witnessed by people in power for the immediate impact of their actions and their words on minority and indigenous communities. Whenever politicians chase voters or news outlets seek to increase their readerships and advertising revenues by targeting migrants, they ignore the very real consequences in terms of increased hatred towards those same communities.","The other reason is that we sought to reflect the lived realities of migrants and refugees themselves – in particular, how discrimination and exclusion drive many people to make the very hard choice to leave their homes. It remains very difficult to arrive at a total percentage of minorities and indigenous peoples among the world’s migrants and refugees.","This is partly due to lack of interest – after all, much of the reporting on migration remains fixated on overall numbers rather than on the individual stories. More particularly, migrants and refugees who belong to minorities or indigenous peoples may well feel a need to remain silent about their ethnicity or religious faith, for fear of further persecution in transit or upon arrival in their new homes.","However, there are many clear indicators from around the world of an immediate causal link between marginalization and movement. The horrifying targeting of Yezidis by ISIS in Iraq and Syria, as well as more recently of Rohingya by the military and its allies in Myanmar, are by now well-documented. In both cases, the overwhelming majority of the communities have been displaced.","Migrant workers – Russia","But there are many other examples of membership in minority and indigenous populations and displacement. In Ethiopia, the government’s crackdown on political dissent, aimed particularly at the Oromo population, contributed directly to an upsurge in migration from that community. Data collected by the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat (RMMS) showed that by the beginning of 2017 as many as 89 per cent of arriving Ethiopian migrants in the key nearby transit country Yemen stated that they belong to the Oromo community. In Colombia, displacement by armed groups has continued despite the 2016 peace accord.","This disproportionately affects Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities who made up more than a quarter (26 per cent) of the more than 139,000 forcibly displaced in the country between January and October 2017, double their share of the national population as a whole.","In fact, the Colombian example is important as it highlights how, while global attention shifts away from a particular situation, the plight of minorities and indigenous peoples continues. Here, the distinction governments and UN agencies seek to make between refugees on the one hand and migrants on the other becomes blurred and even unhelpful.","The US government denies asylum to victims of Central American gang violence. However, much of the brutal gang-related violence in Guatemala, for instance, has affected indigenous communities disproportionately: decades of conflict and discrimination have left them impoverished and marginalized, with little recourse to protection from police or the judiciary. Indeed, in many cases their situation has been aggravated by official persecution.","The discrimination that caused many migrants and refugees to leave their homes often follows them while in transit. While the abusive treatment of asylum seekers and their families crossing into the US has been widely reported, the crackdown within Mexico on Central American migrants, particularly indigenous community members, has received less coverage.","Significantly, it has resulted not only in the targeting of foreign nationals, including many women and children, but also the arrest and intimidation of indigenous Mexicans by police. Over the past year, reports have emerged from Libya of sub-Saharan Africans trapped by the containment policies of the European Union, who now find themselves targeted by security forces, militias and armed groups. There have been widespread reports of torture, sexual assault and enslavement of migrants, many of whom are vulnerable not only on account of their ethnicity but also as non-Muslims.","The situation is further complicated for groups within minority or indigenous communities, such as women, children, persons with disabilities and LGBTQI people, who contend with multiple forms of discrimination and as a result face heightened threats of sexual assault, physical attacks and other rights abuses – in their places of origin, whilst in transit and upon arrival at their destinations.","What then is needed?","Firstly, all those participating in national and international debates on migration need to tone down their rhetoric. The Danish government could, for instance, have devised policies supporting marginalized urban districts without resorting to the historically loaded term, ‘ghetto’, which immediately stigmatizes residents while giving a green light to racists.","Secondly, governments need to abide by fundamental human rights principles, including the basic right to live with dignity. And finally, all those who are contributing to the debate – including media – must get past the numbers and reveal the individual stories. In order to discuss migration, one needs to understand it fully.","While the way forward may appear challenging, I was inspired by the many Polish journalists who attended our launch event in Krakow and who are already rising to the challenge by seeking out the stories that migrants and refugees have to tell us.","Long Beach, Southern California – Al Jazeera’s Investigative Unit has discovered that a self-deleting messaging app called Tiger Text has been adopted by at least one US police department, which may have used it to share sensitive and potentially incriminating information that they wouldn’t want to be disclosed to a court.","Current and former officers from the Long Beach Police Department in Southern California have told Al Jazeera that their police-issued phones had Tiger Text installed on them.","The Tiger Text app is designed to erase text messages after a set time period. Once the messages have been deleted, they cannot be retrieved – even through forensic analysis of the phone.","The police officers who spoke with Al Jazeera said the confidential messaging system was used to share details of police operations and sensitive personnel issues.","Two of the officers claimed that they were also instructed by their superiors to use the app to “have conversations with other officers that wouldn’t be discoverable”.","They saidthey understood this to include exculpatory evidence that could be potentially helpful to attorneys in both civil and criminal proceedings against the department.","It’s a claim that the Long Beach Police Department denies.","But the officers say they were not surprised by the instructions, claiming that the discovery process within the police department was never on the “up and up”.","“I find it odd that we have a communication system that circumvents everything that we are supposed to be doing,” said one officer who is still with the department.","But “nothing surprises me working there”.","‘Institutional cover-up’","According to the research group Mapping Police Violence, the Long Beach Police Department ranked fifth in the nation for officer-involved shootings per capita in 2015.","Civil rights lawsuits have resulted in the city of Long Beach paying out tens of millions of dollars to the families of those shot.","One former police officer said he suspects this is what motivated the department to adopt the application.","“There have been a number of officer-involved shooting cases that have hurt the department,” he said.","“This is a way for them to conceal and get away with some of the negative things that affect their liability with these cases.”","Mohammed Tajsar, a lawyer with the ACLU, told Al Jazeera that he was shocked by the officers’ claims.","“If the department brass instructed members of the force to use Tiger Text to shield from the public the disclosure of sensitive messages about investigations into police killings, then this is an institutional cover-up of the highest order, designed to protect a department that is notorious for killing people,” Tajsar said.","Al Jazeera obtained financial records from the Long Beach Police Department that indicate that the Tiger Text system has been in place since at least 2014, with over 100 police personnel using the app.","More than 100 police personnel at the Long Beach Police Department have been using Tiger Text since 2014 [Al Jazeera]","One document from the City of Long Beach Purchasing Division describes the app as “a secure messaging platform for criminal investigations and confidential communications.”","All the officers Al Jazeera spoke to asked that their identity be kept confidential for fear of reprisals from the police department.","They say that the Tiger Text app was set to delete messages after a few days and that it was distributed to officers in specialised details and to all senior officers above the rank of lieutenant.","The ACLU believe that by using the app, the Long Beach Police Department could be breaking laws that require the preservation of records and the rules that require their disclosure during legal cases, potentially putting thousands of court verdicts at risk.","Al Jazeera’s investigation into the use of Tiger Text found that the Georgia Department of Corrections also began using the application in 2013.","But lawyers for the department quickly decided that its use would likely violate Georgia law, possibly breaching the state’s records retention legislation and most likely leading to court discovery violations.","Insufficient evidence","One Long Beach police officer told Al Jazeera that while he was working within the Department, he witnessed Tiger Text being used during an investigation into the police shooting of Jason Conoscenti in the Alamitos Beach neighbourhood in 2014.","The officers involved in the shooting were cleared of any wrongdoing after prosecutors found insufficient evidence to bring charges.","Al Jazeera spoke to several lawyers who have litigated against Long Beach. None were aware of the police department’s use of the Tiger Text app.","Nikhil Ramnaney, a deputy public defender with the Law Offices of the Los Angeles County Public Defender said his office might now be forced to review all Long Beach cases since 2014, adding: “I don’t know what information is in those Tiger Texts, it could be exculpatory, it could lend to practices that are unconstitutional or even illegal.”","In response to AJ Jazeera’s investigation, Long Beach Police Department said it “complies with all laws related to discovery, and any information relevant to a specific investigation would be documented and provided according to legal requirements”.","The department said it uses the Tiger Text application “to communicate confidential crime scene information, victim information, and personnel matters between department management personnel, as well as employees in specialised details”.","Joanna Schwartz, an expert on police litigation at the UCLA School of Law believes it is difficult to predict the legal problems that the use of a self-deleting app will bring for the Long Beach Police Department.","“The use of Tiger Text by the police makes it more difficult to bring winning civil cases against them and effectively to defend criminal cases. The immediate question is; is this the kind of police department that the City of Long Beach wants to have?”","A Russian military aircraft carrying 14 people disappeared off the Syrian coast on Monday as Israeli fighter jets were attacking targets in the area and as a French ship was launching missiles, the Russian news agency Interfax reported, citing the Russian Defense Ministry.","The Defense Ministry said that the Il-20 surveillance plane disappeared from radar screens Monday night when it was 22 miles from the Mediterranean coast. The aircraft had been returning to a Russian air base near the Syrian port city of Latakia.","Russia has been the most important backer for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria during the country’s long-running civil war, now approaching eight years, and it has sent warplanes and troops to support him.","Mr. Shoigu’s announcement came after the President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared to delay what had been forecast to be a bloody assault on Idlib by agreeing to establish a “demilitarized zone” there.","At least three million Syrian civilians and 30,000 insurgent fighters, including Qaeda-linked jihadists, have been cornered in Idlib, the last significant piece of territory in Syria that Mr. Assad does not control. Syria’s allies include Russia and Iran.","Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the United States Central Command, referred questions on the episode to the Russian Defense Ministry. “The U.S. was not involved in any strikes in Western Syria or in the shoot down of any planes tonight,” he said on Monday evening.","‘);$vidEndSlate.removeClass(‘video__end-slate–inactive’).addClass(‘video__end-slate–active’);}};CNN.autoPlayVideoExist = (CNN.autoPlayVideoExist === true) ? true : false;var configObj = {thumb: ‘none’,video: ‘world/2018/04/27/history-korean-war-north-south-korea-lon-orig-ejk.cnn’,width: ‘100%’,height: ‘100%’,section: ‘international’,profile: ‘expansion’,network: ‘cnn’,markupId: ‘large-media_0’,adsection: ‘const-article-carousel-pagetop’,frameWidth: ‘100%’,frameHeight: ‘100%’,posterImageOverride: {“mini”:{“width”:220,”type”:”jpg”,”uri”:”//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427113024-24-koreas-summit-0427-small-169.jpg”,”height”:124},”xsmall”:{“width”:307,”type”:”jpg”,”uri”:”//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427113024-24-koreas-summit-0427-medium-plus-169.jpg”,”height”:173},”small”:{“width”:460,”type”:”jpg”,”uri”:”//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427113024-24-koreas-summit-0427-large-169.jpg”,”height”:259},”medium”:{“width”:780,”type”:”jpg”,”uri”:”//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427113024-24-koreas-summit-0427-exlarge-169.jpg”,”height”:438},”large”:{“width”:1100,”type”:”jpg”,”uri”:”//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427113024-24-koreas-summit-0427-super-169.jpg”,”height”:619},”full16x9″:{“width”:1600,”type”:”jpg”,”uri”:”//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427113024-24-koreas-summit-0427-full-169.jpg”,”height”:900},”mini1x1″:{“width”:120,”type”:”jpg”,”uri”:”//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427113024-24-koreas-summit-0427-small-11.jpg”,”height”:120}}},autoStartVideo = false,isVideoReplayClicked = false,callbackObj,containerEl,currentVideoCollection = [{“title”:”How did Korea split?”,”duration”:”01:36″,”sourceName”:”CNN”,”sourceLink”:””,”videoCMSUrl”:”/video/data/3.0/video/world/2018/04/27/history-korean-war-north-south-korea-lon-orig-ejk.cnn/index.xml”,”videoId”:”world/2018/04/27/history-korean-war-north-south-korea-lon-orig-ejk.cnn”,”videoImage”:”//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427113024-24-koreas-summit-0427-large-169.jpg”,”videoUrl”:”/videos/world/2018/04/27/history-korean-war-north-south-korea-lon-orig-ejk.cnn/video/playlists/north-south-koreas-summit/”,”description”:”North and South Korea have pledged to end the Korean War later this year.

He was however still experiencing hallucinations and delirium, his girlfriend told Russian media on Friday.","Late on Saturday, he was flown to Germany aboard a medical helicopter chartered by the Cinema for Peace Foundation, an NGO which has long supported the band’s activism.","On arrival, he was met by Pussy Riot’s Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, his estranged wife, who told a German newspaper the poisoning may have been an attempt to kill him.","“I’m working on the principle that he was the victim of either an act of intimidation or attempted murder,” she told the Sunday edition of Bild.","Speaking to a Russian website on Friday, his girlfriend Veronika Nikulshina, also a Pussy Riot activist, said it was “definitely poisoning”.","She said he had been administered a “large dose” of anti-cholinergic drugs, which are used to treat a range of issues including lung conditions. His family said he was not on any medication.","– Testing for poison –","Verzilov’s collapse on Tuesday came after he and Nikulshina had served a 15-day jail sentence along with two other Pussy Riot members for invading the pitch during the World Cup final in July to highlight Russian police abuses.","Jaka Bizilj, who chairs the Cinema for Peace Foundation, said the NGO had urgently despatched an air ambulance to bring him to Berlin to run tests.","“It was important for the family that he be hospitalised as quickly as possible outside of Russia,” he told Bild.","“We hope it will be possible in Berlin to quickly help him and see if he was poisoned in Russia, and how,” he added.","The paper said the German government was also involved in talks over transferring him to Berlin.","Another Pussy Riot member Maria Alyokhina told RIA Novosti state news agency that Tolokonnikova had also been involved in organising the airlift.","“They found a doctor there, he will give a diagnosis and treat him,” she said.","Writing on Facebook, his girlfriend Nikulshina expressed relief he had been transferred out of Russia.","“Three times hurrah to everyone who wrote, phoned, visited, cried and sang: we’re in Berlin. All is well,” she wrote.","Pussy Riot activist Pyotr Verzilov was rushed to hospital on Tuesday then treated in intensive care for an apparent poisoning","NEW BERN: The Marines, the Coast Guard, civilian crews and volunteers used helicopters, boats and heavy-duty vehicles Saturday to rescue hundreds of people trapped by Florence’s onslaught, even as North Carolina braced for what could be the next stage of the disaster: widespread, catastrophic flooding inland.","The death toll from the hurricane-turned-tropical storm climbed to 11.","A day after blowing ashore with 90 mph (145 kph) winds, Florence practically parked itself over land all day long and poured on the rain. With rivers swelling toward record levels, thousands of people were ordered to evacuate for fear the next few days could bring the most destructive round of flooding in North Carolina history.","More than 2 feet (60 centimeters) of rain had fallen in places, and the drenching went on and on, with forecasters saying there could be an additional 1{ feet (45 centimeters) by the end of the weekend.","“I cannot overstate it: Floodwaters are rising, and if you aren’t watching for them, you are risking your life,” Gov. Roy Cooper said.","As of 8 p.m., Florence was centered about 65 miles (100 kilometers) east-southeast of Columbia, the South Carolina capital, crawling west at 2 mph (4 kph) — not even as fast as a person walking. Its winds were down to 45 mph (75 kph). But with half of the storm still out over the Atlantic, Florence continued to collect warm ocean water and dump it on land.","In its initial onslaught along the coast, Florence buckled buildings, deluged entire communities and knocked out power to more than 900,000 homes and businesses. But the storm was shaping up as a two-part disaster, with the second, delayed stage triggered by rainwater working its way into rivers and streams. The flash flooding could devastate communities and endanger dams, roads and bridges.","Authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of up to 7,500 people living within a mile (1.6 kilometers) of a stretch of the Cape Fear River and the Little River, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the coast. The evacuation zone included part of the city of Fayetteville, population 200,000.","And on Saturday evening, Duke Energy disclosed that heavy rains had caused a slope to collapse at a coal ash landfill at a closed power station outside Wilmington, North Carolina. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced at the Sutton Plant and that contaminated storm water likely flowed into the plant’s cooling pond.","The company hasn’t yet determined i whether any contamination may have flowed into the Cape Fear River. Sutton was retired in 2013 and the company has been excavating ash to remove to safer lined landfills. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including lead and arsenic.","Elsewhere, officials in Harnett County urged residents of about 1,100 homes to clear out because the Lower Little River was rising toward record levels.","One potential road out was blocked as flooding forced the shutdown of a 16-mile (26-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 95, the main highway along the Eastern Seaboard.","In New Bern , along the coast, homes were completely surrounded by water, and rescuers used inflatable boats to reach people.","Kevin Knox and his family were rescued from their flooded brick home with the help of Army Sgt. Johan Mackie, part of a team using a phone app to locate people in distress. Mackie rode in a boat through a flooded neighborhood, navigating through trees and past a fencepost to get to the Knox house.","“Amazing. They did awesome,” said Knox, who was stranded with seven others, including a boy who was carried out in a life vest. “If not, we’d be stuck upstairs for the next … how long? I have no idea.”","New Bern spokeswoman Colleen Roberts said 455 people in all were rescued in the town of 30,000 residents without any serious injuries or deaths. But thousands of buildings were damaged in destruction Roberts called “heart-wrenching.”","Across the Trent River from New Bern, Jerry and Jan Andrews returned home after evacuating to find carp flopping in their backyard near the porch stairs.","Coast Guard helicopters were taking off across the street to rescue stranded people from rooftops and swamped cars. Coast Guard members said choppers had made about 50 rescues in and around New Bern and Jacksonville as of noon.","Marines rescued about 20 civilians from floodwaters near Camp Lejeune, using Humvees and amphibious assault vehicles, the base reported.","In Lumberton, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) inland, Jackie and Quinton Washington watched water filling both their front and back yards near the Lumber River . Hurricane Matthew sent more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water into their home in 2016, and the couple feared Florence would run them out again.","“If it goes up to my front step, I have to get out,” Quinton Washington said.","The dead included a mother and baby killed when a tree fell on a house in Wilmington, North Carolina. South Carolina recorded its first death from the storm, with officials saying a 61-year-old woman was killed when her car hit a tree that had fallen across a highway.","Three died in one inland county, Duplin, because of water on roads and flash floods, the sheriff’s office said. A husband and wife died in a house fire linked to the storm, officials said, and an 81-year-old man died after falling and hitting his head while packing to evacuate.","In Washington, President Donald Trump was briefed by telephone Saturday on Florence’s impact. The White House released a photograph showing Trump seated at a desk with a phone to his ear and Vice President Mike Pence standing nearby. Later, Trump tweeted his condolences, writing, “Deepest sympathies and warmth go out to the families and friends of the victims. May God be with them!”","Retired Marine Garland King and his wife, Katherine, evacuated their home in New Bern on Friday and returned Saturday, sharing a kiss and joining hands as they drew near their house.","“It was tough. Wobbling. I was looking for water moccasins to hit me at any time,” he said.","They finally made it, and found a soggy, stinking mess.","“The carpets. The floors. Everything is soaking wet,” Katherine King said. “We’re going to have to redo the whole inside.”","The National Hurricane Center said Florence broke a North Carolina rainfall record that had stood for almost 20 years: Preliminary reports showed Swansboro got more than 30 inches (75 centimeters) and counting, obliterating the mark set in 1999, when Hurricane Floyd dropped just over 24 inches (60 centimeters) on the state.","As of noon, Emerald Isle had more than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain, and Wilmington and Goldsboro had about a foot (30 centimeters). North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, had around 7 inches (18 centimeters).","Stream gauges across the region showed water levels rising steadily, with forecasts calling for rivers to crest Sunday and Monday at or near record levels. The Little River, the Cape Fear, the Lumber, the Neuse, the Waccamaw and the Pee Dee were all projected to rise over their banks, flooding cities and towns.","Forecasters said the storm will eventually break up over the southern Appalachians and make a sharp rightward swing to the northeast, its rainy remnants moving into the mid-Atlantic states and New England by the middle of the week.","Gym Addicts","My name is Jenny Nelson, and I am a 36-year-old wife and mom living in the Arizona desert. I’d like to say my fitness journey began early on in life, but that’s not the case. In fact, in my adolescent years, and into my 20s, health and fitness was not even on my radar. In 2007 I was pregnant with my first (and only) child, and I gained a little over 70 pounds. In 2008 I gave birth to my daughter, and I expected the weight was just going to just fall off. That didn’t happen. I was a stay at home mom, who became more sedentary, and who’s nutrition choices were awful, so the weight stuck around. In 2012 I decided that it was finally time to turn my life around, lose the weight and get healthy. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired!","Initially I joined a large gym, but that didn’t work out for me for multiple reasons. Being a stay at home mom to a small child meant “me” time was limited. I struggled to even make it to the gym. When I could go, I felt overwhelmed and uncomfortable exercising in front of so many other people. I just couldn’t stick with it.","I remembered a piece of exercise equipment my mom had when I was younger, the Total Gym. I decided to buy one for myself and see if it could help me reach my goals. Well, with enough consistency (I was able to work out when it best fit my schedule) and hard work (I was comfortable enough to “give it my all” at home) …it did! I used my Total Gym faithfully, combined with a couple other things, and over time I not only lost the weight I had gained during pregnancy, but I got in better shape than I was in before having my daughter! I would be a liar if I said I haven’t also tried many other tools in my fitness journey, but they have almost all ended up falling to the side except my Total Gym. It is the one piece of equipment I have continued to use all these years. Why? Because it’s the one tool that I have found most effective for reaching whatever goal I have. Initially that was weight loss. After the weight loss, my goal eventually shifted to sculpting muscle, and Total Gym is successfully helping with that too. On my schedule, all from the comfort of my own home!","Thanks for reading my story. For those interested in my personal favorite Total Gym workouts, I highly suggest Rosalie Brown’s “Cardio Free” workout on YouTube as well as her “Cable Core” workout on Total Gym TV. Also, a workout I created (below). I hope you enjoy it!","Jenny’s Workout","Plie Jump Squats","Pull Ups (first round narrow grip, second wide, third underhand)","Glute Bridge to Hamstring Curl using the squat stand or Pilates stand","Single Arm Chest Sweep (side sitting on board)","Single Leg Squat Jumps","Back Rows","Chest Press","Hamstring Curls (on board using pull up attachment or wing bar for feet)","Bicep Curls","Lying Overhead Tricep Extensions","Cable Overhead Shoulder press","12 reps each move.

In 2011, Facebook and the FTC reached a settlement over charges that it deceived its users in a variety of ways, including: sharing posts that were marked “Friends Only” with third-party apps, storing data after users deleted their accounts, and sharing user data with advertisers after promising it wouldn’t. As part of the settlement, Facebook had to agree to several measures of transparency about user privacy, including \"giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings,\" preventing anyone from accessing data from deleted accounts, and getting a third-party privacy checkup every two years.","The user data taken by a researcher through a quiz app that was later sold to Cambridge Analytica happened in 2014, years after the FTC settlement. \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" according to a statement in Monday's FTC release.","Here is the full statement by Tom Pahl, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection:","The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers.

Over the weekend, Android owners were displeased to discover that Facebook had been scraping their text-message and phone-call metadata, in some cases for years, an operation hidden in the fine print of a user agreement clause until Ars Technica reported. Facebook was quick to defend the practice as entirely aboveboard—small comfort to those who are beginning to realize that, because Facebook is a free service, they and their data are by necessity the products.","In its current iteration, Facebook’s Messenger application requests that those who download it give it permission to access incoming and outgoing call and text logs. But, as users discovered when prompted to download a copy of their personal data before permanently deleting their Facebook accounts, a certain amount of data was covertly siphoned without explicit permissions. Buried inside those data caches was an unsettling amount of specific, detailed information—in some cases, every phone call or text message ever sent or received on their Android device. Dylan McKay, who apparently owns an Android phone, reported that for the period between November 2016 and July 2017, his archives contained “the metadata of every cellular call I’ve ever made, including time and duration” and “metadata about every text message I’ve ever received or sent.” When people like McKay agreed to share their contacts with Facebook, it appears they didn’t know the extent to which they were giving Facebook access to their personal information.","Facebook responded with a blog post laying out the applicable user-agreement terms and denying that Facebook collects call or SMS data surreptitiously. “Contact uploading is optional. People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone—it’s explained right there in the apps when you get started,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian. “People can delete previously uploaded information at any time and can find all the information available to them in their account and activity log from our Download Your Information tool.”","But the revelation couldn’t have come at a worse time for Facebook, which is trying—and failing—to dig itself out from under the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. On Sunday, the company released a full-page print advertisement in the U.K.’s The Observer,The Sunday Times,Mail on Sunday,Sunday Mirror,Sunday Express, and the Sunday Telegraph, along with American newspapers The New York Times,The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, in an attempt to regain public trust. In the ad, Zuckerberg called the Cambridge Analytica leak a “breach of trust” and apologized, reassuring readers that “we’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” but so far it seems to have missed the mark. According to a poll from SurveyMonkey and Axios published on Monday, Facebook’s already-low favorability rating has dropped twice as much as that of other tech giants from October 2017 to March 2018."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds | News | The Guardian","text":["The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook.","Facebook’s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company’s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.","Cambridge Analytica boasts of dirty tricks to swing elections","Read more","The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analyticato determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.","The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.","The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.","On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.","“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.","The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.","Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.","Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.","Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.","Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”","The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.","“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”","Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Free labor is Facebook's lifeblood","Cambridge Analytica may have been the straw that broke the camel's back for Facebook users.","Image: bob al-greene/mashable","By Casey Williams2018-03-26 16:47:32 UTC","Chances are, you work for Facebook.","You probably don't have an office or an ID card. And you almost certainly don't get paid. But if you're one of the 239 million Americans who use the platform each month, your work is as valuable as a coder's. Maybe more. Your clicks, likes, and posts keep content circulating, users scrolling, and data streaming into algorithms used to serve you ads. Leave, and the platform crumbles.","You do two jobs for Facebook. You generate data and produce content. Facebook is essentially an advertising company, and every bit of information you disclose is data advertisers can use to influence how and what you buy. Sometimes it's fairly benign (maybe you do want that Blue Apron subscription). Other times it's not. Data is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to shape your behavior, and as Cambridge Analytica shows, it can be dangerous.","Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there","You also create most of what's on Facebook. You write posts, share photos, and capture live video of speeches, protests, and police shootings. The time and effort you sink into crafting a poetic confession, an impassioned rant, a thoughtful reflection on the day's news — think of it as work you do for Facebook. You're working to keep the site humming and vibrant, and you're creating reasons for others to keep scrolling. Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there.","And you spend a lot of time doing it. In 2016, users spent an average of 50 minutes a day using Facebook products, including Instagram and Messenger. That number has declined recently, but let's say you spend, say, 35 minutes a day on the site. That's 26 eight-hour days a year — \"more than any other leisure activity surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the exception of watching television programs and movies,\" according to the New York Times. \"It's more time than people spend reading (19 minutes); participating in sports or exercise (17 minutes); or social events (four minutes).\"","Time Well Spent?","Leisure is labor on Facebook. People use the app voluntarily, and yet, as more and more social activities relocate to the internet, it's increasingly work people feel they have to do to live meaningful, connected lives. Facebook is a News Feed, photo album, personal archive, community forum, and more. Think, for a second, about deleting Facebook. What will happen to your photos? Where will you get your news? Will anyone remember your birthday?","Like all social media companies, Facebook makes money from the basic labors of life: our need to maintain friendships and family ties, keep up with news, form and share beliefs about the world. \"What appears, at first glance, to be a free activity of communication,\" researchers at the University Lüneburg and University of Essex wrote in a recent paper, \"is in fact a form of 'free labor.'\"","It's valuable labor, too. The company earned nearly $16 billion in profit in 2017, according to its annual earnings report. Most of that was from ad revenue, which jumped nearly 50 percent.","Free labor has always made the U.S. economy hum. Slavery got the country on its feet, and unpaid house work — cooking, cleaning and child care, still done mostly by women — has for over two centuries made it possible for people to wake up every morning and go to work. The effort we put into caring for others is labor, and women still do most of that, too. While employers mostly benefit from this unpaid work indirectly, social media companies go right to the source. They extract value directly from the work we do to stay connected to the world.","This kind of extraction isn't unique to Facebook, or even to social media. The idea of a \"prosumer\" — a consumer who also produces — dates back to the 1980s. Sites like Yelp rely on users to generate reviews; Spotify asks listeners to fill in missing album data; Medium makes money from amateur writers looking to publish. Like Facebook, these sites often frame your work as an opportunity to \"connect\" or \"share.\" Not paying for this work is called \"crowdsourcing.\"","Critics of this model say it's exploitation. Eric Posner, a legal theorist at the University of Chicago, has called Twitter users a \"slave labor force,\" and small-time YouTube celebrities have objected to the platform's efforts to make it harder for YouTubers to monetize videos.","Whatever else it is, social media is work","Whatever else it is, social media is work. People who create content for a living understand this better than most. If you're a photographer, you have to be on Instagram. And if you're a journalist, you have to be on Twitter. It’s where you find breaking news, promote work, and get gigs — often on your own time. Ditching Twitter \"would be a disaster\" for writers and the companies they work for, Ethan Klapper, HuffPost’s global social media editor, told the New Republic in 2017.","The nonstop churn of social media skews what kind of work has monetary value. Amateur reporters break news before professionals, so media companies expect writers to churn out reports off the clock. And when the internet is awash in content, no one wants to shell out for words and images they can get for free.","Yes, a few social media users have figured out how to turn their work into cash. Modern celebrities like PewDiePie and the #vanlife couple have used social platforms to launch lucrative careers. It's easy to envy these people; after all, they rake in cash doing what everyone else does for free. But the fact that some people get paid is evidence of the value of every user's labor.","Maybe we all deserve a little something. After all, we don't really use Facebook; we make it.","Casey Williams is a writer based in Durham, North Carolina.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)","Facebook is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million users to try to influence elections.","NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook “likes” can tell a lot about a person. Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of — and which Facebook may have enabled.","The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.","Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 percent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain’s information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica’s servers because the British firm had been “uncooperative” in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it “stood down” that effort at the request of British officials.","Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet , Stamos said he’s still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.","It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.","Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm “took fake news to the next level.”","“This is based on an idea called ‘informational dominance,’ which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what’s actually happening,” Wylie said Monday on NBC’s “Today.” It’s not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.","Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research — not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked — even though those friends hadn’t downloaded the app or given explicit consent.","Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.","Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon — later President Donald Trump’s campaign chairman and White House adviser — as a vice president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.","The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person’s viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch.","But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it’s connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media.","Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” He said the firm “works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.”","Wylie told “Today” that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn’t know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge’s data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn’t retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn’t use it in its 2016 campaign work.","Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.","Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.","Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.","It’s possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz’s campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.","Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn’t immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn’t immediately respond to emailed questions.","Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook’s mapping of the “social graph” — essentially the web of people’s real-life connections — is also invaluable for marketers.","For example, researchers can look at people’s clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.","Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center. While people don’t exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the “rabbit hole” of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.","___","An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the sum paid by the 2016 Trump campaign to Cambridge Analytica.

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","TechCrunch has reached out to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica with additional questions about the timing of this disclosure and the data’s relationship, if any, to the Trump campaign and will update when we hear back."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Cambridge Analytica secured contracts for US elections that were served by the UK-based SCL, despite the possibility that its use of data scientists with foreign citizenship was a violation of campaign finance laws. (It also is being investigated for its possible involvement in the UK’s Brexit referendum.)","Advertisement","Mercer wanted results, per the Times’ report, and SCL’s election division hired Cambridge University’s Dr. Aleksandr Kogan to provide psychometric data that could be used for targeted advertising. Kogan created an app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” that was legitimately downloaded some 270,000 times, but the paper wrote Kogan actually managed to provide the “raw profiles” of approximately 50 million users whose data was supposed to be used only for the purposes of improving the app’s user experience. The Times added that “roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles.”","(Though Kogan is a Cambridge professor, the university is not affiliated with the analytics company nor was he allegedly acting on its behalf when designing the app.)","Though it’s unclear how that data was used in the 2016 elections, Vox noted that Trump’s digital operation was “shockingly effective,” running thousands of variants of online ads to help “determine which messages were resonating where and then shape Trump’s travel schedule around it.”","Advertisement","“We’ve rolled out a long-form quantitative instrument to probe the underlying traits that inform personality,” Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix said in a 2016 speech. “If you know the personality of the people you’re targeting, you can nuance your messaging to resonate more effectively with those key groups.”","In a blog post, Facebook VP Paul Grewal explained that the social media site had learned of the improperly obtained data and ordered SCL, Cambridge Analytica, affiliated staff, and Kogan to delete it in 2015. Now, Grewal wrote, Facebook believes that these parties lied about whether they still have the millions of profiles and have opted to suspend them pending the outcome of an investigation.","Advertisement","However, it’s not clear that Facebook did all it could to verify the data was not still floating around out there earlier. Former Cambridge Analytica data scientist Christopher Wylie told the Observer that Facebook never aggressively followed up to ensure the data was actually deleted, and only required them to “tick a box on a form and post it back.”","According to CNN, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said that it contracted with Kogan for a project in 2014 but that it had deleted the data when it became clear it was improperly obtained. The spokesperson added, “No data from [Kogan’s firm Global Science Research] was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","But something shady seems to be going on. The Times reported that “a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.”","Advertisement","As the Wall Street Journal noted last year, Cambridge Analytica’s role in Trump’s campaign drew the scrutiny of special counsel Robert Mueller, the Department of Justice investigator looking into the alleged Russian plot to meddle in the 2016 elections. As the Washington Post added, disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn also disclosed an “advisory role” at the company, which Cambridge Analytica denies was ever actually implemented. Nix, the CEO, also disclosed last year that he had reached out to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in an attempt to secure leaked Hillary Clinton campaign emails allegedly stolen by Russian hackers, though he said he was rebuffed.","Update 3/18/2018 at 7:05pm ET: It looks like the fallout from this situation is beginning to settle over Facebook, which is facing renewed inquiries about why it did not act faster to certify whether the data was destroyed. Per CNN, Facebook also admitted that it is looking into “ties” between current Facebook researcher Joseph Chancellor and Kogan’s firm, GSR, which was dissolved in 2017. It’s unclear at this point what role, if any, Chancellor had in improperly obtaining the data on tens of millions of Facebook users, though Chancellor was reportedly listed on paperwork as one of GSR’s directors.","Advertisement","Some former federal officials have also begun talking about whether Facebook’s lack of control over the data constituted a violation of a 2011 Federal Trade Commission consent decree with Facebook that its users must explicitly give consent before their data is shared, per the Washington Post. The paper reported that damages could in theory go up to $40,000 per violation, which if applied to all 50 million individuals allegedly impacted would mean Facebook’s “possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars.” (In practice, this is unrealistic, but any penalty assessed could still be very large.) The incident may also indicate that such violations of the FTC rulings were commonly ignored as part of Facebook’s business model, which could backfire big time for the social media giant.","Finally, Facebook is coming under additional fire for its decision to suspend data analyst Christopher Wylie’s account. Wylie worked for Cambridge Analytica during the period that the data was allegedly obtained, but has characterized his involvement in the ongoing revelations about the company’s conduct as whistle-blowing.","Advertisement","Yet the intrigue doesn’t end there. Per the Financial Times, Cambridge Analytica’s damage control efforts have included attempts to halt a Channel 4 interview between Nix and undercover reporters in which the CEO “talks unguardedly about its practices.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

That approach is now under fire on both sides of the Atlantic.","\"All parties involved — including the SCL Group/Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie and [thisisyourdigitallife creator] Aleksandr Kogan— certified to us that they destroyed the data in question,\" said Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel.","\"In light of new reports that the data was not destroyed, we are suspending these three parties from Facebook, pending further information.

Zuckerberg himself is nothing but a nerd who struck gold. He’s out of his depth and shows it, like a deer in the headlights. FB’s COO Sandberg is a more wordly operator, but both are essentially unprincipled people deeply embedded in the Democrats’s campaign to curtail free speech while deepening the Russophobic hysteria.","The New York Times has led with the story three out of the last five days and carried at least one front-page story every day this week. The rest of the mainstream press has followed suit, promoting a campaign—without any evident popular following—for users to leave the social media company, complete with a ready-made hashtag: #DeleteFacebook. In response to the campaign, Facebook’s stock price has fallen by 11 percent, wiping out some $50 billion from the company’s market capitalization.","The harvesting of the personal information of some 50 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica raises serious privacy concerns. But the media firestorm sparked by the synchronized release of the story by the New York Times and the Guardian has far darker and more nefarious motives. Using the election data scandal as a cover, the media, working with the intelligence agencies and leading congressional Democrats, is seeking to create the climate for a crackdown on political opposition on the world’s largest social network.","From the standpoint of bourgeois election campaigns, massive data harvesting operations are par for the course. In 2012, the Obama reelection campaign did essentially the same thing as Cambridge Analytica, prompting users to install a Facebook app that harvested the information of users’ entire contact list, netting up to 190 million profiles. At the time, the practice was not only widely reported, but praised by major news outlets as evidence of the innovative and forward-thinking nature of the campaign.","Moreover, despite having access to Cambridge Analytica’s massive trove of Facebook information, the Trump campaign did not choose to use the data because it already had access to an even bigger, more comprehensive, and more accurate dataset from the Republican National Committee.","Flush with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, secured from billionaire donors who are wealthier than ever, modern bourgeois election campaigns employ hundreds, or even thousands, of staff members, many with advanced computer science and statistics degrees, to mine, quantify, and analyze private data, with the aim of influencing and shaping voters’ political views.","These operations massively dwarf the scale of the alleged “meddling” by “Russians” in the 2016 presidential election, which, according to a report submitted by Facebook to the Senate Intelligence Committee, consisted of buying some $100,000 of Facebook advertisements both before and after the election.","Given the diminutive scale of the role played by Cambridge Analytica in the election campaign, what accounts for the massive campaign in the press for users to “Delete Facebook?”","The real issues underlying the campaign can be seen in another report, published on the front page of the New York Times Wednesday, headlined, “Fed Up, Teachers in Oklahoma May Walk Next,” warning that the strike movement by educators, which began in West Virginia, risks spreading to Oklahoma, Arizona, and other states.","The article notes that “several Facebook groups” have been “pushing for a walkout,” and that “Rank-and-file teachers” have used the social media network to organize outside of the framework of the teachers’ unions.","The growth of working-class opposition is the real target of the media firestorm over Facebook’s alleged data lapse. The aim of the press campaign is to create the climate for the introduction of even more explicit censorship measures.","In successive interviews responding to the allegations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, reversing their previous positions, vociferously endorsed a bill working its way through Congress to target “foreign meddling” in US politics by severely restricting the purchase of political advertisements—one of the few avenues left open to independent news outlets to attract a broader readership on Facebook.","“We’re open to regulation. We work with lawmakers all over the world,” Sandberg told CNBC. Zuckerberg, speaking to CNN, said he would “love to see” regulation targeting Facebook advertisements like those allegedly purchased by “Russians.”","FRIENDLY WITNESS—HAVEN’T WE SEEN THIS BAD MOVIE BEFORE? Sandberg agreeing with her inquisitors. The best defence is to join them, and kiss a lot of ass.","In his CNN interview, Zuckerberg pledged to redouble Facebook’s efforts to combat the efforts of “folks trying to sow division.” He said the company would “do a better job of tracing and using AI tools to be able to scan and observe a lot of what is going on.” He said that he was open to further government regulation of the company, that is, a greater integration of Facebook with the state and its intelligence agencies.","He then went on to say that Facebook now employs “15,000 people working on security and content review,” and that this number would rise to 20,000 by the end of the year.","This amazing admission means that, based on the company’s employee headcount of 25,000 at the beginning of this year, most of the company’s employees are engaged in reviewing and censoring user content. From a company nominally dedicated to helping users share information and learn about the world, Facebook is being transformed into an instrument of police repression and censorship.","The media is working to create the political climate for the further implementation of mass censorship on the world’s largest social media platform.","Behind the scenes, the campaign has been accompanied by the announcement this week by Google of a “news initiative” aimed at censoring independent news outlets like the World Socialist Web Site and promoting “trustworthy” news sources such as the New York Times and Washington Post. The announcement marks a significant intensification of measures, beginning with changes in Google’s search algorithm last April, that have led to a massive drop in search traffic to left-wing, anti-war, and socialist web sites.","Workers entering into struggle to defend their jobs, wages, and working conditions must see the drive toward censorship for what it is: not only an existential threat to their constitutionally protected freedom of expression, but an effort to smash their efforts at self-organization and struggle to break free of the grip of the trade union bureaucracy.","We urge all workers and young people who understand the importance of this fight to contact the World Socialist Web Site and join its campaign against Internet censorship.","^0Americans are the most over-entertained, uninformed people on the planet.","Ignorant about domestic and geopolitical issues mattering most.","The most important act anyone can do is stop using all mainstream media.","No exceptions whatsoever. It’s brainwash propaganda.","Toxic sludge for the mind.","Voices like this are NEVER heard on the mainstream media.","The \"1%\" is the global plutocracy, the billionaires.","A sociopathic, puny segment of humanity.","These people pretend to honor and defend democracy.","But are its murderers and undertakers.","Gross injustice, war, grotesque inequality is their handiwork.","And the murder of the planet","Just 8 billionaires own as much wealth as HALF of all humanity.","That's 8 guys are richer than 4 billion people.","The corporate media is their main line of defense.","That's why the best way to break their hold on us...","Is to break their media.","The corporate chokehold on political information is killing us.","Save humanity, the planet and its innocent creatures.","Increase public distrust in the mainstream media.","Defeat their power to mislead.","They lie 24/7.

{"originalurl":"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/05/20/americans-attitudes-about-privacy-security-and-surveillance/","title":"Americans' Attitudes About Privacy, Security and Surveillance | Pew Research Center","text":["Americans’ Attitudes About Privacy, Security and Surveillance","The cascade of reports following the June 2013 government surveillance revelations by NSA contractor Edward Snowden have brought new attention to debates about how best to preserve Americans’ privacy in the digital age. At the same time, the public has been awash with news stories detailing security breaches at major retailers, health insurance companies and financial institutions. These events – and the doubts they inspired – have contributed to a cloud of personal “data insecurity” that now looms over many Americans’ daily decisions and activities. Some find these developments deeply troubling and want limits put in place, while others do not feel these issues affect them personally. Others believe that widespread monitoring can bring some societal benefits in safety and security or that innocent people should have “nothing to hide.”","Americans’ views about privacy and surveillance are relevant to policymaking on these matters. Key legal decisions about the legitimacy of surveillance or tracking programs have hinged on the question of whether Americans think it is reasonable in certain situations to assume that they will be under observation, or if they expect that their activities will not be monitored. A federal appeals court recently ruled that a National Security Agency program that collects Americans’ phone records is illegal. In striking down the program, Judge Gerald Lynch wrote: “Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans. Perhaps such a contraction is required by national security needs in the face of the dangers of contemporary domestic and international terrorism. But we would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate, and expressed in unmistakable language.”","Two new Pew Research Center surveys explore these issues and place them in the wider context of the tracking and profiling that occurs in commercial arenas. The surveys find that Americans feel privacy is important in their daily lives in a number of essential ways. Yet, they have a pervasive sense that they are under surveillance when in public and very few feel they have a great deal of control over the data that is collected about them and how it is used. Adding to earlier Pew Research reports that have documented low levels of trust in sectors that Americans associate with data collection and monitoring, the new findings show Americans also have exceedingly low levels of confidence in the privacy and security of the records that are maintained by a variety of institutions in the digital age.","While some Americans have taken modest steps to stem the tide of data collection, few have adopted advanced privacy-enhancing measures. However, majorities of Americans expect that a wide array of organizations should have limits on the length of time that they can retain records of their activities and communications. At the same time, Americans continue to express the belief that there should be greater limits on government surveillance programs. Additionally, they say it is important to preserve the ability to be anonymous for certain online activities.","Most Americans hold strong views about the importance of privacy in their everyday lives.","The majority of Americans believe it is important – often “very important” – that they be able to maintain privacy and confidentiality in commonplace activities of their lives. Most strikingly, these views are especially pronounced when it comes to knowing what information about them is being collected and who is doing the collecting. These feelings also extend to their wishes that they be able to maintain privacy in their homes, at work, during social gatherings, at times when they want to be alone and when they are moving around in public.","When they are asked to think about all of their daily interactions – both online and offline – and the extent to which certain privacy-related values are important to them, clear majorities say these dimensions are at least “somewhat important” and many express the view that these aspects of personal information control are “very important.”","Survey results from early 2015 show:","93% of adults say that being in control of who can get information about them is important; 74% feel this is “very important,” while 19% say it is “somewhat important.”","90% say that controlling what information is collected about them is important—65% think it is “very important” and 25% say it is “somewhat important.”","At the same time, Americans also value having the ability to share confidential matters with another trusted person. Nine-in-ten (93%) adults say this ability is important to them, with 72% saying it is “very important” and 21% saying it is “somewhat important.”","Permission and publicness are key features that influence views on surveillance.","Americans say they do not wish to be observed without their approval; 88% say it is important that they not have someone watch or listen to them without their permission (67% feel this is “very important” and 20% say it is “somewhat important”).","However, far fewer (63%) feel it is important to be able to “go around in public without always being identified.” Only 34% believe being able to go unnoticed in public is “very important” and 29% say it is “somewhat important” to them. In both cases, all adults, regardless of age or gender, express comparable views.","The findings above come from a survey conducted Jan. 27 to Feb. 16, 2015, among 461 adults on the GfK Knowledge Panel. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.8 percentage points. The findings cited below in the Summary section come from a separate survey of 498 adults on the same Knowledge Panel; that survey was conducted between Aug. 5 and Sept. 2, 2014, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.6 percentage points.","Americans have little confidence that their data will remain private and secure.","For all of the 11 entities we asked about in the fall 2014 survey – from government agencies to credit card companies to social media sites – only small minorities say they are “very confident” the records maintained by these organizations will remain private and secure.","Just 6% of adults say they are “very confident” that government agencies can keep their records private and secure, while another 25% say they are “somewhat confident.”","Only 6% of respondents say they are “very confident” that landline telephone companies will be able to protect their data and 25% say they are “somewhat confident” that the records of their activities will remain private and secure.","Credit card companies appear to instill a marginally higher level of confidence; 9% say they are “very confident” and 29% say they are “somewhat confident” their data will stay private and secure.","Online service providers are among the least trusted entities when it comes to keeping information private and secure. When asked about search engine providers, online video sites, social media sites and online advertisers, the majority felt “not too confident” or “not at all confident” that these entities could protect their data:","76% of adults say they are “not too confident” or “not at all confident” that records of their activity maintained by the online advertisers who place ads on the websites they visit will remain private and secure.","69% of adults say they are not confident that records of their activity maintained by the social media sites they use will remain private and secure.","66% of adults say they are not confident that records of their activity maintained by search engine providers will remain private and secure.","66% say they are not confident that records of their activity collected by the online video sites they use will remain private and secure.","Few feel they have “a lot” of control over how much information is collected about them in daily life and how it is used.","When asked how much control they feel they have over how much information is collected about them and how it is used in their everyday lives, only a small minority of Americans say they have “a lot” of control over their personal data collection and its use.","When thinking about a range of activities that might take place on a typical day, 9% say they feel they have “a lot” of control over how much information is collected about them and how it is used, while 38% say they have “some control.” Another 37% feel they have “not much control,” and 13% feel they personally have “no control at all” over the way their data is gathered and used.","A very small number say they have changed their behavior to avoid being tracked recently, but many were already engaged in more common or less technical privacy-enhancing measures.","At the time of the mid-2014 survey, the vast majority of respondents – 91% – had not made any changes to their internet or cellphone use to avoid having their activities tracked or noticed. Only 7% reported that they had made these kinds of changes in “recent months.”","At the same time, a much larger group had engaged in some everyday obfuscation tactics and privacy-enhancing measures. These activities were not necessarily in direct response to news of government monitoring programs, but, rather, represent a set of measures that respondents may have engaged in out of broader concerns about their personal info. Some of the more common activities include:","Clearing cookies or browser history (59% have done this).","Refusing to provide information about themselves that wasn’t relevant to a transaction (57% have done this).","Deciding not to use a website because they asked for a real name (23% have done this).","Advanced measures, such as the use of proxy servers and encryption are less common.","This survey included somewhat more expansive questions about advanced privacy-enhancing measures such as the use of proxy servers, virtual private networks and encryption across a variety of communications channels, following up on findings reported earlier this year. However, even with comparatively broader language, just one-in-ten Americans said they had adopted these more sophisticated steps to shield their information:","10% of adults say they have encrypted their phone calls, text messages or email.","9% say they have used a service that allows them to browse the Web anonymously, such as a proxy server, Tor software, or a virtual personal network.","Most want limits on the length of time that records of their activity can be retained.","There is wide variation across the length of time that respondents feel is reasonable for businesses and other organizations to store their data. Additionally, there is considerable variance on their views depending on the kind of organization that retains the records of the activity. In general, and even though it may be necessary to provide certain functionality, people are less comfortable with online service providers – such as search engine providers and social media sites – storing records and archives of their activity.","50% of adults think that online advertisers who place ads on the websites they visit should not save records or archives of their activity for any length of time.","44% feel that the online video sites they use shouldn’t retain records of their activity.","40% think that their search engine provider shouldn’t retain information about their activity.","40% think that social media sites they use shouldn’t save data about their activity.","At the other end of the spectrum, the vast majority of adults are comfortable with the idea that credit card companies might retain records or archives of their activity. Just 13% think that credit card companies “shouldn’t save any information.”","Those who have greater awareness of the government monitoring programs are more likely to believe that certain records should not be saved for any length of time.","Those who have had the most exposure to information about the government surveillance programs also have some of the strongest views about data retention limits for certain kinds of organizations. These differences are particularly notable when considering social media sites. Among those who have heard “a lot” about the government collecting communications data as part of anti-terrorism efforts, 55% say that the social media sites they use should not save any information regarding their activity, compared with 35% of those who have heard “a little” about the government monitoring programs.","65% of American adults believe there are not adequate limits on the telephone and internet data that the government collects.","When asked to think about the data the government collects as part of anti-terrorism efforts, 65% of Americans say there are not adequate limits on “what telephone and internet data the government can collect.”1 Just 31% say they believe that there are adequate limits on the kinds of data gathered for these programs. The majority view that there are not sufficient limits on what data the government gathers is consistent across all demographic groups. Those who are more aware of the government surveillance efforts are considerably more likely to believe there are not adequate safeguards in place; 74% of those who have heard “a lot” about the programs say that there are not adequate limits, compared with 62% who have heard only “a little” about the monitoring programs.","55% of Americans support the idea of online anonymity for certain activities, but many are undecided on the issue.","In the current survey, the majority of adults (55%) said that people should have the ability to use the internet completely anonymously for certain kinds of online activities. Another 16% do not think people should be able to remain anonymous when they are online; 27% said they don’t know.","Men are more likely than women to think people should be able to engage in certain online activities anonymously (61% vs. 49%), but support for internet anonymity does not vary by age. Education is a predictor, but income is not; adults with at least some college education are significantly more likely than those who have not attended college to believe that people should have the ability to use the internet anonymously (66% vs. 40%).","Even as they expect online anonymity, most assume that motivated people and organizations could uncover private details.","Many believe they are particularly vulnerable to people or organizations who have a motive to learn private details about their past. When considering how difficult it would be for a motivated person or organization to learn private details about their past that they would prefer to keep private, 64% of adults said it would be “not too” or “not at all” difficult for a motivated person or organization to uncover that sensitive information. Just 20% felt it would be “very” or “somewhat” difficult.","Men and women report similar responses, but those ages 50 and older (76%) are significantly more likely to believe it would be “not too” or “not at all difficult” when compared with those under the age of 50 (54%). Similarly, those with a college degree are more likely than those who have not attended college to feel more exposed (70% vs. 58%).","More about these surveys","The majority of the analysis in this report is based on a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Aug. 5, 2014, and Sept. 2, 2014, among a sample of 498 adults ages 18 or older. The survey was conducted by the GfK Group using KnowledgePanel, its nationally representative online research panel. GfK selected a representative sample of 1,537 English-speaking panelists to invite to join the subpanel and take the first survey in January 2014. Of the 935 panelists who responded to the invitation (60.8%), 607 agreed to join the subpanel and subsequently completed the first survey (64.9%), the results of which were reported in November 2014. This group has agreed to take four online surveys about “current issues, some of which relate to technology” over the course of a year and possibly participate in one or more 45- to 60-minute online focus group chat sessions. For the second survey whose results are reported here, 498 of the original 607 panelists participated. A random subset of the subpanel is occasionally invited to participate in online focus groups. For this report, a total of 26 panelists participated in one of three online focus groups conducted during December 2014. Sampling error for the total sample of 498 respondents is plus or minus 5.6 percentage points at the 95% level of confidence.","An additional survey related to Americans’ views about the importance of privacy was conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 16, 2015, among a sample of 461 adults ages 18 or older. The sample was drawn from the same 607 adults who agreed to participate in the subpanel on privacy. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.8 percentage points.","For more information on the Privacy Panel, please see the Methods section at the end of this report.","Acknowledgements","The authors would like to acknowledge the generous contributions of the various outside reviewers who offered their insights at various stages of this project.

And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.","Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.","Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\"","Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.","In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted all of it.","Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act \"and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.","Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.","The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","And yet as the firm sought to build \"psychographic profiles\" to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg after reports that the advertising-data firm Cambridge Analytica retained information on tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent. Facebook has already testified about how its platform was used by Russian propagandists ahead of the 2016 election, but the company never put Zuckerberg himself in the spotlight with government leaders. The pressure may also foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network. The company on Friday said that a professor used Facebook's log-in tools to get people to sign up for what he claimed was a personality-analysis app he had designed for academic purposes. To take the quiz, 270,000 people gave the app permission to access data via Facebook on themselves and their friends, exposing a network of 50 million people. That kind of access was allowed per Facebook's rules at the time. Afterward, the professor violated Facebook’s terms when he passed along that data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook found out about the breach in 2015, shut down the professor’s access and asked Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted the user data. Yet the social network on Friday suspended Cambridge from its system, explaining that it had learned the information was not erased. Cambridge, originally funded by conservative political donor Robert Mercer, on Saturday denied that it still had access to the user data, and said it was working with Facebook on a solution.","Slimline Optical TurnstileThe new Slimline Series from Designed Security, Inc., provides a refined visual and physical turnstile with barrier.

Police Chief Brian Manley said that both men who were injured in Sunday night’s explosion in the southwestern Austin neighborhood of Travis Country are white, unlike the victims in the three earlier attacks, who were black or Hispanic. On Monday, authorities were canvasing the area in search of anything suspicious, and residents were warned to remain indoors and to call 911 if they needed to leave their homes before 10 a.m. Travis Country is far from the sites of the earlier bombings, which occurred over two-plus weeks in residential neighborhoods east of Interstate 35, which divides the city. Manley also said authorities had worked to “clear” a suspicious backpack found in the area that was part of a separate report. The first of the four explosions to hit Austin this month was caused by a package bomb that detonated at a northeast Austin home on March 2, killing a 39-year-old man. Two more package bombs then exploded farther south on March 12, killing a 17-year-old, wounding his mother, and injuring a 75-year-old woman. Police said all three of those were likely related and involved packages that had not been mailed or delivered by private carrier but left overnight on doorsteps. Manley originally suggested they could have been hate crimes since all the victims of the first three explosions were black or Hispanic, but now says that investigators aren’t ruling out any possible motive.","Nuclear energy regulators said on Friday afternoon that no operations were affected by the months-long Russian cyber campaign to hack vital U.S. industries, including numerous energy companies. Meanwhile, a nuclear industry organization added that no U.S. plants reported cyberattacks during this time. The statements come one day after the Trump administration publicly blamed Russian government hackers for launching cyber espionage attacks on a number of critical U.S. industries, including the nuclear sector. In an alert published by the Homeland Security Department and FBI, officials revealed that the hackers had infiltrated computer networks to collect intelligence that would allow them to shut down systems. But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that during the campaign, \"there was no adverse impact to any of the NRC-regulated safety, security or emergency preparedness functions.\" It added that \"the corporate networks of some NRC licensees were affected.\" NRC spokespeople did not address the question of whether hackers had demonstrated the capacity to affect operations at any point. The Nuclear Energy Institute stated that \"no U.S. nuclear plants have been breached by a cyberattack.\" It noted that nuclear plants are required to notify regulators of digital incursions within 60 days. \"No such notification has ever transpired,\" the organization said. Cyber experts frequently note that many digital attacks go unreported.","North Korea is the top threat to the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, according to Navy Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., who outlined concerns about North Korea, China, and Russia, as well as the threat from violent extremists, during a recent Senate Armed Services Committee fiscal year 2019 budget hearing. America's security and economic prosperity are linked to the region, which is currently at a crossroads in which tangible opportunity meets significant challenge, according to Harris Jr. One of the major problems is overcoming the perception that the United States is a declining or disinterested power in the region. However, \"A fully resourced defense budget leading in the long-term budget stability will send a strong signal to our allies and partners and all potential adversaries that the U.S. is fully committed to preserving a free and open order in the Indo-Pacific,\" Harris Jr. testified. In addition, Harris Jr., said he is encouraged by recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, including the possibility of a meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, China is using its military and economic power to erode the free and open international order, according to Harris Jr. Finally, Harris Jr. discussed how Russian operations and engagements throughout the Indo-Pacific region continued to rise, both to advance strategic interests and to undermine the United States.","One of five Windham police officers conducting a security review at Windham High School broke protocol when he ordered a group of about 50 students in the cafeteria to get on the floor. The officer was conducting a walk-through inspection of the school, and told the students in a study group, \"This is a drill, this is a drill, please get down,\" according to Windham police chief Kevin Schofield. The other officers conducting the walk-through found out about what had happened within minutes and told the students there was no drill, they were not in danger, and their study hall should not have been interrupted. The police department decided to conduct the walk-through after a lockdown drill for the school had to be canceled because of two snow days cutting into instructional time. However, even a full lockdown drill, which is more extensive and conducted to make sure emergency measures are put in place, would not have included ordering students to the ground. A \"get down\" command would be part of a \"full-fledged active-shooter drill,\" but those are not conducted when students are in school and would typically involve only police and staff, according to Schofield.","Password management best practices are changing, as flawed principles of the last decade have resulted in poor user experience and inadequate security. First, many groups are eliminating password expiration requirements. Coming up with complex character or word combinations across dozens of accounts, memorizing them, and changing them frequently is difficult. As a result, users tend to violate other security principles, such as by writing down passwords or recycling passwords from other accounts. A related principle that should be scrapped is character complexity. Although administrators should forbid commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) warns they should not impose other composition rules, such as \"requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters.\" Third, spaces are now popular for credentials because they allow for password complexity in the form of memorably odd phrases such as \"Space the Final Font Here.\" Fourth, it is inadvisable to request specific types of information from users, such as their first pet or first car. These \"secret\" answers to security questions tend to be known, knowable, or easily guessed. Fifth, stored password hints are no longer recommended: if the clue is good enough to help the true account holder, there is a chance it will help the hacker too. Finally, such \"memorized secrets\" could soon be a thing of the past: password managers, biometric identifiers, and out-of-band authenticators are examples of digital identification which have shown an increase in user satisfaction and security.","South Wales Police's chief constable Matt Jukes is calling for an increase to the police budget, saying the cost of security at concerts and sporting matches in Cardiff and Swansea has risen 50 percent in the last year. South Wales Police polices about 200 major events a year, such as the Welsh rugby internationals, but the force said there was an additional \"multi-million\" cost because of the increased U.K. terror threat level. Jukes said the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London last year had been \"real game changers\" for the force, adding the extra cost, including armed officers, was becoming a significant challenge. \"We're now talking about multi-million pound costs for us every year in terms of tackling those issues,\" he said. While venues pay South Wales Police for policing at events, they do not cover the extra policing needed to deal with the impact on the streets outside. The U.K.'s current threat level is severe and Cardiff council's leader said the Home Office needed to recognize security costs had escalated given the increased threat of terrorism. The Home Office announced that in 2018/19, the budget for England and Wales would increase by £50 million to £757 million \"to help deal with the fast-changing and increasingly challenging threat from terrorism.\"","A new study found one in five teachers who were physically or verbally attacked by students didn't report it to school administrators. Eric Anderman, the lead author of the study and chairman of the Ohio State University's Department of Educational Studies, says the main purpose of the study was to examine how teachers handle attacks by students. The National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers contacted their members to complete the survey, which asked them to anonymously describe the “most upsetting” incident they experienced and then answer questions about it. According to Anderman, nearly 3,500 teachers responded to the survey. Some responses were rejected if teachers reported no incident or their memory of the event was incomplete, which gave researchers 2,505 responses from 48 states to work with. One-quarter of the teachers reported actual physical abuse or assault, 20 percent reported threats of physical violence, and 37 percent reported verbal insults, disrespectful language, or inappropriate sexual advances. The study found approximately 81 percent went to school administrators after the attack, 87 percent confided in a fellow teacher, 76 percent told a family member, 35 percent called a union representative, and 12.4 percent sought professional counseling. Approximately eight percent of respondents did not go into detail regarding their incident but said they did not feel supported by school leaders and colleagues.","In at least four investigations last year, Raleigh, N.C., police used search warrants to obtain Google accounts from any mobile devices that were in the vicinity of the scene of the crime. While city and county officials say that they are balancing civil rights with public safety, and that the practice is a natural evolution of criminal investigative techniques, defense attorneys and privacy advocates are concerned about the potential to ensnare innocent users who may not know just how closely Google tracks their movements.","Three EU financial watchdogs on Thursday concluded that newly agreed and incoming EU measures on data and consumer protection in financial markets will largely alleviate the fears around the potential corporate misuse of client information. In addition, in a joint report the three groups stated that \"a legislative intervention at this point would be premature, given that some key pieces of legislation are yet to be implemented or have just entered into application.\""],"isopubdate":""}

(Benoit Tessier/Reuters)","In hindsight, it's strange that for years, anyone installing a Facebook app could not only give that app's developer access to their personal information, but the personal information of all their friends. Where your friends lived, worked, and went to school — not to mention their interests and the pages they had liked — were all fair game.","The feature was well-intentioned, of course. One app, Job Fusion, used the functionality to show users job openings at the places their friends worked. The video-sharing app Vine let users see which of their Facebook friends also used the app — until, Facebook cut off its competitor's access.","But, notably, developers didn't have to delete the information they had already collected. This weekend, in a pair of reports by the Observer and the New York Times, we learned what one developer did with the data it retained.","Using an innocuous looking quiz and an accompanying Facebook app, a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan collected data from a staggering 50 million Facebook users on behalf of data analytics company Cambridge Analytica. The firm is reported to have used all that data to build detailed profiles on the personalities of American and British voters, for use by Republican political candidates during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Brexit's Vote Leave Campaign.","And as outrageous as that may sound, Facebook was operating exactly as it was designed to at that time — a design that left millions of its users unwittingly exposed.","How the harvesting happened","According to both newspapers, about 270,000 people installed Kogan's Facebook app, which was portrayed as part of an online personality quiz that participants were paid to take. The Observer estimated that each user who installed Kogan's app granted him access to profile information from at least 160 of their friends. All told, he was able to harvest data on 50 million Facebook users in a matter of weeks.","Users were told the data being collected was for academic purposes, and both Facebook's terms of service and British data protection laws prohibited Kogan from selling or sharing the data with third parties without their consent. But the data was provided to Cambridge Analytica nonetheless.","Facebook says, 'Everyone involved gave their consent.' Yet millions of users did not — not explicitly — nor likely expected their data to be shared just because they were friends with someone who participated in a quiz. (Toby Melville/Reuters)","The firm \"then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyze individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour,\" according to the Observer's report. That algorithm could be used to more effectively target Facebook ads to the people their analysis determined would be most likely influenced by its message.","It may have been a violation of the agreement that Kogan made with Facebook — and a violation of what users reasonably expected from a simple personality quiz app. But that was all that separated the behaviour of Kogan's app from otherwise legitimate apps. It collected the same type of data that at least hundreds of other developers also had access to at that time.","Was Facebook breached?","The Observer and the New York Times characterize the data that was harvested and provided to Cambridge Analytica as a breach. Facebook, however, disputes this characterization.","In Facebook's view, Kogan \"did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, or use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed,\" argued the company's chief security office Alex Stamos in a now-deleted series of posts on Twitter.","\"Everyone involved gave their consent,\" echoed Paul Grewal, a Facebook lawyer and company executive, in a statement. \"People knowingly provided their information.\"","Yet millions of users did not — not explicitly — nor likely expected their data to be shared simply because they were friends with someone who participated in a quiz.","It's also clear that Kogan had access to data that — had he been upfront about his intentions — Facebook would not have intended him to access. He effectively lied his way into accessing data that he shouldn't have had access to, under the guise of an academic study. Some might consider that social engineering attack.","And notably, both the Observer and the New York Times reported that copies of the data still exist, outside of Facebook's control.","It may not be a breach in a strict technical sense — but it's almost certainly a breach of trust, at the very least.","There's only so much a user can do","It's worth noting that not all of the data harvested was actually used to build the detailed personality profiles Cambridge Analytica sought. In fact, of the 50 million user profiles scraped, only about 30 million contained enough information to match with existing records obtained from data brokers or provided by political campaigns.","In other words, the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica was only as useful as the quality of personal information that, in the normal course of using Facebook, those users volunteered — the same sort of information that was used to target Facebook users with divisive political ads as part of a broad Russian influence campaign.","Given the fallout from both incidents, it's possible users may be less eager to be as open with Facebook going forward, given the very real risk their data may be misused — something that critics have warned of for years.","But of course, there is only so much that users can do. Users may decide to keep more information off Facebook than they have in the past, but there are other, less obvious ways the company can collect information.","Others may decide to delete Facebook altogether, or limit how often they log on — but again, the ubiquity of the service makes this impractical, not least for those for whom Facebook has become the primary mode of communication with friends or family.","Facebook said so itself: \"This was a scam — and a fraud,\" Grewal told the New York Times. But it was enabled by Facebook's very design.","About the Author","Matthew Braga","Senior Technology Reporter","Matthew Braga is the senior technology reporter for CBC News, where he covers stories about how data is collected, used, and shared.

With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day’s losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06.","The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","Related Coverage","The recovery in Facebook’s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company’s relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","ALL APOLOGIES","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company’s privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook’s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,” said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","Slideshow (3 Images)","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is “absolutely certain” that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers’ access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

This was partly corroborated by Wylie, who said Muresan had been working in India before he died in Kenya under mysterious circumstances.","When prodded by Labour MP Paul Farrelly about CA's role in India, Wylie confirmed that the UK-based CA has offices and employees in the country and offered to hand over relevant \"documentation\" to the Parliamentary committee investigating the matter.","\"They (Cambridge Analytica) worked extensively in India.

{"originalurl":"https://hackernoon.com/cambridge-analytica-what-the-media-wont-tell-you-772d7ec80e4","title":"Cambridge Analytica: What The Media Won’t Tell You – Hacker Noon","text":["This story is seriously a year old, and although I was not the first journalist to write about this, I did bring it to the attention of about 6,300+ readers. While it is new that we have a whistleblower, and the number “50 million accounts”, what the media isn’t telling you is how Cambridge Analytica actually pulled this off.","The fact of the matter is the data that Cambridge Analytica acquired from Facebook, much of which they obtained legally and as Facebook intended them to, was entirely useless without machine learning. Machine learning is one of the baby steps required for building artificial intelligence, it is a field of computer science that gives computer systems the ability to “learn” with data without being programmed by a person. It was this technology that Cambridge Analytica used to analyze tens of millions of users profiles using data they acquired from Facebook, and put together psychological profiles of users. They then used Facebook’s targeted advertising system to display ads and content at those users geared towards their own psychological profile. Think of it as persuasive arguing on steroids hyper targeted by your own beliefs about the world.","For example, I let Cambridge Analytica analyze my data and they pegged me as a liberal. I know this may be a shocking revelation to all of my haters who believe I’m a conservative Russian agent conspiracy theorist who sells tinfoil hats for a living, but according to my Facebook data I’m a liberal. They also determined I’m more intelligent than 96% of Facebook users, and I somehow lost inteligence points because I like the Beatles (mostly a John Lennon fan), but that is a subject for an entirely different article.","What this means is Cambridge Analytica knows I am probably not going to vote for Trump based on my psychological profile. However, that is actually more valuable to them than not. There is little point to spending advertising dollars on people who you know will vote for your candidate, the person you want to target is actually the person who will not vote for your candidate and instead convince them to not vote. This is what I believe Cambridge Analytica did, I believe they targeted liberals in swing states and promoted anti-Hillary content in an attempt to convince people not to vote. It means they had to target fewer people, spend less money, and ultimately accomplish their goal of winning the election.","All Cambridge Analytica had to do was figure out who was a liberal, and convince them not to show up on election day. By doing so they could ignore everyone who couldn’t vote for whatever reason, and only spend a small portion of their budget on making sure Trump supporters showed up to vote. A no-vote was actually more powerful in swing states, where guess what? Liberal voter turnout was lower for Hillary than it was for Obama. Granted, I still think Hillary blew it and didn’t campaign properly. I am not excusing her ineptitude, she was a horrible candidate and I did not vote for her (Yes, I voted for the female doctor instead, and no I don’t regret it, lets just not talk about it, okay?).","Perhaps this is a just a giant coincidence, but I don’t think it is. Given Donald Trump’s ad spend, I’m fairly certain this is exactly what happened. The reason I believe this is because if I were hired to help win an election and had the tools and data Cambridge Analytica had, it is exactly what I would do. I don’t have anything to prove my theory unfortunately, but given what is being reported I am fairly certain I am on to something, and first came up with this theory a year ago before the media went into freak out mode.","This is why psychological profiling, privacy, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is so frightening when put in the wrong hands. It isn’t the machines we need to fear, it is the people who are in control of those machines and our data that we need to worry about. Machines are just tools, but people are fickle and with the right incentive easily corrupted.","Facebook, Not Russia, Helped Trump Win The Election","We know from Wikileaks that John Podesta was in touch with Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, and even thanked her for helping them “elect the first woman President of the United States.” However, Hillary didn’t win despite the fact Facebook was trying to get her elected alongside Google who was censoring search results, possibly running their own bots, and Twitter who was censoring the truth and purposely hiding Wikileaks tweets which are 100% factual (as they later admitted to congress).","The reason Hillary Clinton did not win despite the media and social media companies doing everything they could to rig the election in her favor is because Facebook double dipped and allowed Cambridge Analytica to use their surveying tools to collect user data on tens of millions of users. This data was then used to target tens of millions of users with political advertising using Facebook’s ad platform based on psycholgoical profiles from data they bought or acquired from Facebook.","Facebook is basically responsible for feeding the analytics system that enabled Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign to be so targeted and effective with a minimal budget. They ultimately won Donald Trump the swing states and the election. As well as subverted democracy, and likely made Facebook a bunch of money.","That’s what happened, that’s how Trump won. It wasn’t the Russians, it was our own social media companies who sold our data to the Trump campaign which they then likely used to convince liberals not to vote in swing states. It’s both horrifying, and cleverly brilliant at the same time."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Along with other social media platforms, it makes money by nudging users to provide their data (without understanding the potential consequences), and then using that data in ways well beyond what people may expect.","As individuals, and society as a whole, come to better understand the role social media plays in life and politics, they’re wondering: Is it possible – or worthwhile – to trust Facebook?","Designing for attention","Of course, social media platforms don’t exist without their users. Facebook has grown from its origins serving only college students by exploiting the network effect: If all your friends are socializing on the site, it’s tempting to join yourself. Over time this network effect has made Facebook not only more valuable, but also harder to leave.","However, now that Facebook and its ilk are under fire, it’s possible that those network effects might unravel the other way: Facebook’s number of active users continued to rise in 2017, but in the final three months of the year, its growth showed signs of slowing. If all your friends are leaving Facebook, you might go with them.","The design of social media platforms like Facebook – and many other common apps, such as Uber – is intentionally engrossing. Some scholars go so far as to call it “addictive,” but we’re uncomfortable using the term so broadly in this context. Nevertheless, digital designers manipulate users’ behavior with a wide array of interface elements and interaction strategies, such as nudges and cultivating routines and habits, to keep users’ attention.","Playing tricks on users","To attract users, keep them engaged and ensure they want to come back, companies manipulate the details of visual interfaces and user interaction. For example, the ride-sharing app Uber shows customers phantom cars to trick them into thinking drivers are nearby. The company uses similar psychological tricks when sending drivers text messages encouraging them to stay active.","This manipulation is particularly effective when app developers set default options for users that serve the company’s needs. For example, some privacy policies make users opt out of sharing their personal data, while others allow users to opt in. This initial choice affects not only what information users end up disclosing, but also their overall trust in the online platform. Some of the measures announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations – including tools showing users which third parties have access to their personal data – could further complicate the design of the site and discourage users even more.","Frameworks of trust","Was users’ trust in Facebook misplaced in the first place? Unfortunately, we think so. Social media companies have never been transparent about what they’re up to with users’ data. Without full information about what happens to their personal data once it’s gathered, we recommend people default to not trusting companies until they’re convinced they should. Yet neither regulations nor third-party institutions currently exist to ensure that social media companies are trustworthy.","This is not the first time new technologies created social change that disrupted established mechanisms of trust. For example, in the industrial revolution, new forms of organization like factories, and major demographic shifts from migration, increased contact among strangers and across cultures. That altered established relationships and forced people to do business with unknown merchants.","People could no longer rely on interpersonal trust. Instead, new institutions arose: Regulatory agencies like the Interstate Commerce Commission, trade associations like the American Railway Association, and other third parties like the American Medical Association’s Council on Medical Education established systematic rules for transactions, standards for product quality and professional training. They also offered accountability if something went wrong.","A new need for protection","There are not yet similar standards and accountability requirements for 21st-century technologies like social media. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission is one of the few regulatory bodies working to hold digital platforms to account for business practices that are deceptive or potentially unfair. The FTC is now investigating Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica situation.","Facebook has the technical know-how to give users more control over their private data, but has chosen not to – and that’s not surprising. No laws or other institutional rules require it, or provide necessary oversight to ensure that it does. Until a major social media platform like Facebook is required to reliably and transparently demonstrate that it is protecting the interests of its users – as distinct from its advertising customers – the calls to break the company up and start afresh are only going to grow."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

The pressure may also foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network.","A top UK lawmaker on Monday backed sweeping new powers for the nation’s privacy watchdog.","“The time has now come for us to look at giving more powers to the information commission in the UK,” Damian Collins, a Conservative and chair of the UK Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee, told LBC radio in an interview on Monday.","Facebook on Friday said that a professor used Facebook’s log-in tools to get people to sign up for what he claimed was a personality-analysis app he had designed for academic purposes.","To take the quiz, 270 000 people gave the app permission to access data via Facebook on themselves and their friends, exposing a network of 50 million people, according to the New York Times.","That kind of access was allowed per Facebook’s rules at the time. Afterward, the professor violated Facebook’s terms when he passed along that data to Cambridge Analytica.","Shares in Facebook fell as much as 4.2% during pre-market trading in New York.","Facebook found out about the breach in 2015, shut down the professor’s access and asked Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted the user data.","Yet the social network on Friday suspended Cambridge from its system, explaining that it had learned the information wasn’t erased.","Cambridge, originally funded by conservative political donor Robert Mercer, on Saturday denied that it still had access to the user data, and said it was working with Facebook on a solution.","A researcher who worked with the professor on the app is now currently an employee at Facebook, which is reviewing whether he knew about the data leak.","Criticism","The denials and refutations did little to ease the criticism. Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Sunday that Zuckerberg or another senior executive should appear in front of his committee because previous witnesses have avoided difficult questions, creating “a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.’’","He added in an interview on British radio Monday that Zuckerberg should \"stop hiding behind his Facebook page and actually come out and answer questions about his company.”","The next few weeks represent a critical time for Facebook to reassure users and regulators about its content standards and platform security, to prevent rules that could impact its main advertising business, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.","“Changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote in a note to investors.","Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to explain that the mishandling of user data was out of its hands and doesn’t constitute a “breach” – a definition that would require the company to alert users about whether their information was taken, per US Federal Trade Commission rules.","Menlo Park, California-based Facebook no longer allows app developers to ask for access to data on users’ friends. But the improper handling of the data raises systemic questions about how much companies can be trusted to protect personal information, said Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology.","“While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways,” O’Connor said in a statement.","“Communications technologies have become an essential part of our daily lives, but if we are unable to have control of our data, these technologies control us.

Goff’s team used Facebook and other tools to register more than a million voters online and to raise $690 million online in 2011 and 2012.","“The thing we did that will be most affected — by which I mean rendered impossible — by the changes they're making is the targeted sharing tool,” Goff said.","More than 1 million Obama supporters in 2012 installed the campaign’s Facebook app. These supporters were given the option to share their friend list with the Obama campaign. Goff said most of the app users did so. And when they did, Goff’s team would then “run those friend lists up against the voter file, and make targeted suggestions as to who [supporters] should be sharing stuff with.”","This was a powerful new form of voter outreach. The Obama campaign had concluded that many voters — especially younger Americans — viewed TV and other forms of advertising from the campaign with suspicion and skepticism. But they were still open to messages that came from friends and acquaintances.","The key to getting persuasive messages in front of persuadable voters going forward, the campaign decided, was to have them come from people they knew.","“It's extremely powerful for a campaign to be able to say to [a user], ‘Hey, here are your persuadable friends, ranked in order of where they live: Ohio first, Virginia second, et cetera. Go share this video directly with them,'” Goff said.","The Romney campaign also started doing this, but only in October, a month before the presidential election.","Then in the spring of 2014, Facebook — responding to growing privacy concerns — cracked down on how much information third-party applications could gain about those who installed the apps.","“We've heard from people that they're often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app,” wrote Facebook engineering manager Jeffrey Spehar in a blog post. “So we've updated Facebook Login so that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list.”","Today, when Facebook users choose to share their friend list with an app, only those friends who also use the app become visible, Facebook spokeswoman Tera Randall told Yahoo News.","The changes went into effect for new apps on April 30, and existing apps were given a year before the change applied to them. (In technical terms, what Facebook is doing is changing its Graph application programming interface, or API, as well as the terms of service for app developers.)","What this means in practice is that a group like Ready for Hillary, the grass-roots network of supporters for a Clinton presidential run, has been able to use targeted sharing over the past year. That means it has the Facebook friend lists of all the people who’ve installed Ready for Hillary’s app on the social network.","But when the API and terms-of-service changes become permanent for all apps, Ready for Hillary — as well as any campaign that has bought its voter information — won’t be able to keep up to date with its supporters’ most recent lists of friends, and will learn nothing about the Facebook friends of new supporters. Facebook’s change becomes permanent on April 30, 2015.","Most of the Republican presidential hopefuls, meanwhile, will not get the chance to use the tool at all.","Aside from a brief article over the summer in Campaigns & Elections and one more recently in AdAge, the political press has not taken notice of the change.","Already, though, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has decided not to put time and resources into using Facebook’s targeted sharing tools.","“We could have continued to use it just for this cycle, and it could have been useful to some degree, but for me it was a question of resource prioritization,” said a senior NRSC official. “I wanted to focus on getting the fundamentals right first, then building up the chain of sophistication.”","The NRSC official said that when the committee did use targeted sharing in the Massachusetts special election in June 2013, it showed results, but “we just didn't see the engagement numbers we needed to see to indicate that it was going to be transformative this [past] cycle.”","“Plus, the API and News Feed changes have been so frequent over the past several years that we somewhat doubted the assurances that it would still work on [Election Day],” the NRSC official said. “Even if so, anything we built would have to be scrapped after the cycle; it couldn't serve as the foundation for future cycles, like email list development.”","But the quest to reach voters through their friends will continue to be a highly competitive space in politics.","“I’m not convinced there aren’t going to be ways [to work around the Facebook change]. But nobody has found a way yet,” Goff said.","Stu Trevelyan, CEO of NGP VAN, the top software tool for Democratic campaigns, said that there are still ways to “track relationships in non-Facebook ways.”","NGP VAN’s interface, which taps into voter databases, is used by virtually every Democratic campaign up and down the ballot. So the level of volunteer use around the country is high. And NGP VAN has also created an Action Center tool that has been mapping relationship data among Democratic volunteers and Ready for Hillary supporters.","“[Ready for Hillary] said, ‘Hey supporters, go to the Action Center and share with your friends that they should come and sign up for a free Ready for Hillary bumper sticker,'” Trevelyan said. “Let’s say I clicked on your link and went and asked for a bumper sticker. My record would show in the VAN database that I was recruited by you and you recruited me. There’s a whole level of observed activity.”","“There is an element of our tool currently that uses that Facebook API, but it’s not the only way or even the predominant way that we are mapping relationships,” Trevelyan said.","But as the NRSC official put it, “It seems that the days of getting 1 million users to scrape all of America's social data are gone.”"],"isopubdate":"2014-11-17"}

We serve global business professionals and the next generation of leaders. Thanks for reading! Stay connected with the links below.","Slack is developing tools to tell if someone’s mansplaining","In the early 1990s, newly minted Internet evangelists promised a gender-free utopia. Hierarchical identifiers like race and class would be obscured online, they argued, and biased judgements would therefore become obsolete. That didn’t quite work out.","Gender norms infiltrate digital communication today as powerfully (and as detrimentally to women) as they do in-person, show decades of linguistic analysis. Whether on listservs, text messages, Facebook, or Reddit, men tend to “digitally manspread,” as SusanHerring, a leading linguist studying digital communication dynamics, calls it. Meanwhile, women self-segregate in private, women’s-only spaces, like direct messages.","Slack, the increasingly popular workplace communication platform, is not exempt from this phenomenon. As I wrote in “Your company’s Slack is probably sexist,” women across industries say that their male colleagues dominate public-channel conversations with the same authoritative communication styles they deploy in meetings. Meanwhile, women are more likely to use supportive, friendly punctuation, and to modify their opinions with hedges like “I could be wrong, but…”","Now, Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield says Slack is pioneering products that will provide individual Slack users with data on whether their digital communication changes when they speak with people of different demographics. He says this data will help promote more equal, inclusive workplace cultures, and make employees more efficient and effective.","Bias on Slack","As Slack continues to replace email, becoming the primary means of internal communication at over 50,000 companies worldwide, women’s inhibitions on the platform pose a formidable threat to organizational culture, innovation, and business success.","Of course, gendered or otherwise hierarchical communication norms aren’t universal; some women are comfortable speaking bluntly, especially when other women do the same. And some men self-question to the point of Slack paralysis. Nor is Slack (as a company or product) to blame for the prevalence of gender norms that we start internalizing before we can type—or even speak in full sentences. But while Slack holds that no part of its product facilitates bias, the company now appears to acknowledging that women and people of underrepresented minorities could be silenced on Slack—and looking into product development that addresses these trends.","In November 2017, Slack told Quartz that complaints about the platform’s facilitation of gender bias hadn’t come up. “If we had seen a trend where women said they didn’t have a voice on Slack, we would work on how we might address it,” said Julia Blystone, head of communications at Slack. “But we haven’t heard that in our research.”","Just a few months later, CEO Steward Butterfield indicated that Slack was beginning to address concerns, by developing tools to analyze communication trends on its platform, at the Wharton People Analytics Conference in Philadelphia on March 23. In response to a question from Wharton management professor Mae McDonnell on whether Butterfield ever worries that private Slack chat “channels” can reinforce exclusion, CEO also joked, “I worry about everything. I have a Jewish grandmother.”","“If there are deep and systemic problems at an organization Slack can exaggerate them,” he said.","Butterfield added that the platform can also enhance an organization’s positive characteristics. “If there are real positive attributes and successful [negotiating and conversational] skills within an organization, those can be supercharged,” he said. “So I don’t think there’s anything inherent to [Slack’s] structure… or any inherent visible characteristics that would inhibit diversity.”","Butterfield emphasized that for less loquacious employees of all identities, Slack can be a godsend. Nearly every week, Slack hears from customers who identify as introverted, or previously struggled to participate in meetings “where some of the participants are louder, or more aggressive,” or just prefer to think more slowly, says Butterfield. “They reach out to say thank you, because now with Slack, they can participate asynchronously, and they feel like they have much more input, and are much more active participants in their company’s conversations.”","“Personal analytics” could expose communication bias","While apparently gendered or racial slights in face-to-face communication can be distorted by perception and memory, Slack’s digital archives provide invaluable opportunity for linguistic analyses.","“These are analytics that no one else has access to you except for you,” he said. “And they don’t present you with any real moral value either way, but [they answer questions like], do you talk to men differently than you talk to women? Do you speak to support groups differently than you speak to superiors? Do you speak in public differently than you speak in private?","Butterfield’s New York staff are creating those analytics tools to identify those personal communication styles, he says. “There’s a handful of APIs Slack employees use to do their own queries,” he said. “Our plan for the next couple of years is to expand that as much as possible—so to provide customers with insights about their organizations and individuals.”","Blystone says the personal analytics initiatives are “in the early stages and will continue to develop over the next couple of years.”","As CEO, Butterfield says he’s interested in using Slack communication analytics at a more macro-level to identify dysfunctional teams or mismatched partnerships within his organization. Slack has publicly committed to diversity within its own ranks, and 2016, has raised representation of women in management from 43% to 48%. Nevertheless, people of color remain vastly under-represented, only 5% of employees in tech roles at Slack are black, a disproportion common in tech companies.","The fine line between analysis and surveillance","Early as these products may be, their potential to put data behind damaging (and positive) communication dynamics on a person-by-person basis is unprecedented.","Women and people of underrepresented minorities sometimes don’t speak up about coworkers whose Slack habits make them uncomfortable due to fear that they wouldn’t be believed, or wouldn’t have data to back up their accusations. Convincing as linguistic studies on gendered communication patterns may be, nationally representative samples pale in comparison to easily accessible, real-time data about the people literally sitting (or Slacking) alongside you.","Of course, privacy as it relates to people analytics remains pressing. It’s an issue Slack has yet to resolve.","“We’re a bit stuck in the middle on these conversations about access to information, because most of our large corporate customers have employee provisions which already grant them the right to access all employee communications,” said Butterfield.","Automatic analysis of how users communicate would be a further step. ”It’s a fraught area, because you want people to be empowered by the feedback they’re getting and the tools they’re using, without them feeling like they’re being surveilled,” said Butterfield later.","“That would be useful feedback for any employee, but it’s probably something that people don’t feel very comfortable sharing with their managers or with their peers, so the consent question is really interesting.”","However, even if unfavorable data were to to be exposed about an individual, it can—and, in Butterfield’s books, should—inspire positive change. “So if the result of that [data] is not ‘Hey, it turns out you’re a jerk and we’re firing you,’ but ‘Hey, it turns out we’ve identified some set of problems around communication, or management structure or organizational design, which inhibits the kind of progress we want to make, and therefore we’re going to rectify them,’ that’s a good thing,” he said.","This story is part of How We’ll Win, a project exploring the fight for gender equality at work.

(http://reut.rs/2pn8btD)","The scrutiny presents a fresh threat to Facebook's reputation, which is already under attack over Russia's alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","Facebook said on Monday it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, which had agreed to comply and give the forensics firm complete access to their servers and systems.","Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denies the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","But further allegations about the firm's tactics piled up on Monday, as Channel 4 News, a British broadcaster, published video of Cambridge Analytica executives talking about using bribes, former spies and Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians.","Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after reports in the New York Times and London's Observer over the weekend.","On Monday, Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.","Facebook and rivals including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.","It was not clear whether Republicans who hold congressional committee gavels would announce hearings related to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. But the lawmaker comments reflected mounting bipartisan concern in Washington over whether internet firms are fair trustees of the massive amounts of user data they collect.","Some technology lobbyists have begun to quietly acknowledge the era of a hands-off approach to Silicon Valley from U.S. policymakers may be fading.","On Monday, the Senate was expected to move forward with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking. The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law.","Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing app he had built.","Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved. It also said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission.","\"(Tech companies) are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it,\" said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.","'VERY CONCERNING'","European officials, who have been more willing to regulate Silicon Valley companies than their U.S. counterparts, were especially strident in criticism of Facebook.","The revelations about Cambridge Analytica were \"horrifying, if confirmed,\" said EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova. \"We don't want this in the EU and will take all possible legal measures\" including stricter rules under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect in May, she said.","A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were \"clearly very concerning.\"","Britain's Information Commissioner's Office said it would consider the potential new evidence as part of its separate civil and criminal probe into whether Facebook user data had been abused in British elections.","The head of the European Parliament said EU lawmakers will investigate possible data misuse, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens' privacy rights."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

They said that when they learned about this in 2015, they suspended the app and demanded that all the data be deleted.","Although they were assured the data was destroyed, Facebook says they have reports that this is untrue, and have thereby suspended Cambridge.","Was this data used in the political campaign?","Cambridge Analytica was hired in June 2016 to run the Trump campaign’s data operations. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon had also been a vice president of the firm. It’s unclear as of yet if the data Facebook wanted deleted was used to help Trump win the 2016 campaign.","When some suspected that the company was being investigated for possibly colluding with Russians in the election, they released a statement to Vox. “As one of the companies that played a prominent role in the election campaign, Cambridge Analytica has been asked by the House Intelligence Committee to provide it with information that might help its investigation,” the statement to Vox said.","“We believe that other organizations that worked on the campaign have been asked to do the same.

Facebook frequently defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it's adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. (Andy Tullis/The Bulletin via AP, File)","NEW YORK, N.Y. – To get an idea of the data Facebook collects about you, just ask for it. You’ll get a file with every photo and comment you’ve posted, all the ads you’ve clicked on, stuff you’ve liked and searched for and everyone you’ve friended — and unfriended — over the years.","This trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you. It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable — say, by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed, or reminding you of friends’ birthdays.","Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that’s relatively clear and concise. But few users bother to read it. You might be surprised at what Facebook’s privacy policy allows — and what’s left unsaid.","Facebook’s privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users. While past privacy debacles have centred on what marketers gather on users, the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.","Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it’s adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators, Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used — to a point.","You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead, the way you would on television or in a newspaper. In the ad settings, you’d need to uncheck all your interests, interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don’t want to use in targeting. Of course, if you click on a new interest after this, you’ll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting. It’s a tedious task.","As Facebook explains, it puts you in target categories based on your activity. So, if you are 35, live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page, Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area.","But activity isn’t limited to pages or posts you like, comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites.","“If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too,” Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent techno-sociologist, said in a 2017 TED talk .","And, increasingly, Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data, purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways. The more information it has, the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers. It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing — anything from your ethnicity to personality traits, happiness and use of addictive substances, Tufekci said.","These types of data collection aren’t necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings.","What Facebook does say is that advertisers don’t get the raw data. They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach, then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads.","Apps can also collect a lot of data about you, as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.","Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately — but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling. Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time, even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent.","Ian Bogost, a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue-in-cheek game called “Cow Clicker” in 2010, wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for “deliberately nefarious ends” was easy to do then. What’s worse, he said, it was hard to avoid extracting private data.","If “you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behaviour,” he wrote. “I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood.”","Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access. But other types of data collection are still permitted. For this reason, it’s a good idea to check all the apps you’ve given permissions to over the years. You can also do this in your settings."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

{"originalurl":"https://www.theatlantic.com:443/technology/archive/2018/03/facebook-cambridge-analytica/555866/","title":"Cambridge Analytica and the Dangers of Facebook Data-Harvesting - The Atlantic","text":["On Friday night, Facebook suspended the account of Cambridge Analytica, the political-data company backed by the billionaire Robert Mercer that consulted on both the Brexit and Trump campaigns.","The action came just before The Guardian and The New York Timesdropped major reports in which the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie alleged that Cambridge Analytica had used data that an academic had allegedly improperly exfiltrated from the social network. These new stories, backed by Wylie’s account and internal documents, followed years of reporting by The Guardianand The Intercept about the possible problem.","The details could seem Byzantine. Aleksandr Kogan, then a Cambridge academic, founded a company, Global Science Research, and immediately took on a major client, Strategic Communication Laboratories, which eventually gave birth to Cambridge Analytica. (Steve Bannon, an adviser to the company and a former senior adviser to Trump, reportedly picked the name.)","The promise of Kogan’s company was that they could build psychological profiles of vast numbers of people by using Facebook data. Those profiles, in turn, might be useful to tune the political messages that Cambridge Analytica sent to potential voters. Perhaps a certain kind of message might appeal more to extroverts, or narcissists, or agreeable people.","To gather that data, the Times reports, Kogan hired workers through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to install a Facebook app in their accounts. The app, built by Global Science Research, requested an unusual (but not unheard-of) amount of data about users themselves and their friends. That’s how 270,000 Turkers ended up yielding 30 million profiles of American Facebook users that could be matched with other data sets.","From the current reporting, it seems that Kogan violated Facebook’s terms of service in saying he was using the data for academic research, but then selling it to Strategic Communications Laboratories. That’s what got Cambridge Analytica and Kogan in trouble. (Cambridge Analytica told The Guardian that they do not have possession of the data nor did they use any of this data in the 2016 election. An anonymous source in the Times story disputes this.)","There’s a lot about Cambridge Analytica that doesn’t quite add up. Are they data geniuses who swung the Brexit vote and got Trump elected, or pretenders bluffing their way to fat marketing contracts? Right after the election, several stories pointed to their psychological profiles of voters as a crucial piece of the Trump digital machine. As time has gone on, their role has come to be seen as less important, more in line with the tiny slice of the Trump campaign treasury that they got, roughly $6 million.","While the specifics of this particular violation are important to understand, the story reveals deeper truths about the online world that operates through and within Facebook.","First, some of Facebook’s growth has been driven by apps, which the company found extended the amount of time that people spent on the platform, as retired users of FarmVille could attest. To draw developers, Facebook had quite lax (or, as one might say, “developer-friendly”) data policies for years.","Academic researchers began publishing warnings that third-party Facebook apps represented a major possible source of privacy leakage in the early 2010s. Some noted that the privacy risks inherent in sharing data with apps were not at all clear to users. One group termed our new reality “interdependent privacy,” because your Facebook friends, in part, determine your own level of privacy.","For as long as apps have existed, they have asked for a lot of data and people have been prone to give it to them. Back in 2010, Penn State researchers systematically recorded what data the top 1,800 apps on Facebook were asking for. They presented their results in 2011 with the paper “Third-Party Apps on Facebook: Privacy and the Illusion of Control.” The table below shows that 148 apps were asking for permission to access friends’ information.","Pennsylvania State University","But that’s not the only way that friends leak their friends’ data. Take the example of letting an app see your photos. As the Penn State researchers show, all kinds of data can be harvested: who’s tagged in photos, who liked any of the pictures, who commented on them, and what they said.","If one were to systematically crawl through all the data that could be gleaned from just a user’s basic information, one could build a decent picture of that person’s social world, including a substantial amount of information about their friends.","Facebook has tightened up some of its policies in recent years, especially around apps accessing friends’ data. But TheGuardian’s reporting suggests that the company’s efforts to restuff Pandora’s box have been lax. Wylie, the whistleblower, received a letter from Facebook asking him to delete any Facebook data nearly two years after the existence of the data was first reported. “That to me was the most astonishing thing,” Wylie told The Guardian. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","But even if Facebook were maximally aggressive about policing this kind of situation, what’s done is done. It’s not just that the data escaped, but that Cambridge Analytica almost certainly learned everything they could from it. As stated in The Guardian, the contract between GSR and Strategic Communications Laboratories states, specifically, “The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information.”","It’s important to dwell on this. It’s not that this research was supposed to identify every U.S. voter just from this data, but rather to develop a method for sorting people based on Facebook’s profiles. Wylie believes that the data was crucial in building Cambridge Analytica’s models. It certainly seems possible that once the “training set” had been used to learn how to psychologically profile people, this specific data itself was no longer necessary. But the truth is that no one knows if the Kogan data had much use out in the real world of political campaigning. Psychological profiling sounds nefarious, but the way that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica first attempted to do it may well have proven, as the company maintains, “fruitless.”","So what is to be done? It’s possible that these new stories will cause Facebook to restrict the use of its data by people outside the company, including legitimate researchers. But that kind of self-imposed or external regulation would not strike at what’s actually scary about these efforts.","If Cambridge Analytica’s targeted advertising works, people worry they could be manipulated with information—or even thoughts—that they did not consent to giving anyone. And societally, a democracy running on micro-targeted political advertisements tuned specifically for ever tinier slices of the population is in trouble, as scholars like Zeynep Tufekci warned in 2012 (and in 2014).","Those two concerns extend far beyond Cambridge Analytica. In fact, the best system for micro-targeting ads, political or otherwise, to particularly persuadable segments of the population is Facebook itself. This is why Facebook’s market value is half a trillion dollars.","In Facebook’s ad system, there are no restrictions on sending ads to people based on any “targetable” attribute, like older men who are interested in the “Confederate States of America” and the National Rifle Association and who are “likely to engage with political content (conservative).”","A screenshot from Facebook’s ad-purchasing platform (Alexis Madrigal)","That’s to say nothing of the ability to create databases of people from other sources—electoral rolls, data on purchasing habits or group affiliations, or anything gleaned by the hundreds of online data companies—then letting Facebook itself match those people up to their Facebook accounts. Facebook might never reveal the names in an audience to advertisers or political campaigns, but the effects are the same.","Facebook’s laxity and the researcher’s malfeasance are newsworthy. But is the problem with privacy-obviating social networks, psychological profiling, and political micro-targeting that some researcher violated Facebook’s terms of service? Or is it that this controversy estranges the whole enterprise, providing a route to approach the almost unthinkable changes that have come to democratic processes in the Facebook era?","We want to hear what you think about this article.

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Advertisement - story continues below","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Do you think this company helped Trump win the election as Facebook claims?","YesNo","Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge.

What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization.","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Advertisement - story continues below","Severalreports, including The New York Times’ one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.”","But as noted by Grewal in an update made Saturday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact, standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”","Founded by Tucker Carlson, a 25-year veteran of print and broadcast media, and Neil Patel, former chief policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, The Daily Caller News Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit providing original investigative reporting from a team of professional reporters that operates for the public benefit."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

(In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out.","Google+ Followers","Popular Posts","Indian telecom operator Reliance Jio is in talks with Xiaomi to bring the Xiaomi Smart TVs in India along with the JioFiber bundle.

Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"https://kingcrypto.cf/to/facebook-truths","title":"Facebook’s Role in Data Misuse Sets Off Storms on Two Continents - The New York Times","text":["WASHINGTON — Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data, as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump’s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network’s alerting users.","Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data “to target political advertising and manipulate voters.”","The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

It Also Spies on You on the Web. Firefox Made an Add-on to Stop It | Inc.com","text":["Now the Firefox browser, offered by the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation, is offering a way to stop Facebook's tracking in the form of an add-on called Facebook Container. Installing that add-on makes it much more difficult for Facebook's algorithms to track what you do online.","Here's how it works: When you install the app, it will automatically log you out of Facebook. When you log back in, Facebook will run inside a digital container that isolates it from the rest of your activity online. There may be a downside in terms of convenience: If there are sites that you sign into using your Facebook credentials, you'll need to change your sign-in method. And if you're accustomed to clicking Facebook \"like\" or \"share\" buttons on other websites (such as this one), you'll have to actually copy and paste the link into Facebook instead. But Facebook will be effectively prevented from seeing what you're doing when you're not doing it on Facebook.","Obviously, Facebook is not the only company tracking your activity online. You know this already, especially if you've ever shopped for something online, decided not to buy it, and then seen ads for whatever it was dogging you across every website you visit for the next several days. So why is Mozilla focusing its attention on Facebook alone?","As Nick Nguyen, VP of Firefox product writes in a blog post, a lot can be inferred about you from the websites you visit. That information becomes exponentially more revealing when it's combined with your social media activity. It seems clear from the Cambridge Analytica scandal among other things that Facebook can't necessarily be trusted with this kind of deeply detailed data. As Nguyen notes, the Facebook Container would not have prevented Cambridge Analytica from gaining access to personal data on 50 million or more Facebook users. Still, it seems sensible to limit Facebook's privacy intrusions whenever you can.","Besides, Firefox isn't singling Facebook out. Its Multi-Account Containers allow you to build virtual walls around different parts of your life so that, for example, if you're at a website you'd prefer your employer not to know about, you don't have to open a separate browser to check your work email account.","There's something in it for Firefox, too, of course. With the new privacy-strengthened, super-fast Firefox Quantum browser it released last year, Mozilla, once a dominant browser, is hoping to win back some of the users it lost to Google Chrome. Google deserves a privacy black eye for creating the API that allowed Facebook to track users' phone calls and texts for years without their express permission. Perhaps this is just retribution.","So if the thought of Facebook or anyone else tracking your activity on the web makes you queasy, and it probably should, consider downloading and trying out Firefox Quantum and the Facebook or Multi-Account Container. As Nguyen notes, it's impossible for most of us to know what data is being collected and when, or what the implications are of companies like Facebook having that data. Until we do, better to keep that data to ourselves."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The computer scientists posited a logical hypothesis, which they set out to rigorously test: If the Russians were worming their way into the DNC, they might very well be attacking other entities central to the presidential campaign, including Donald Trump’s many servers. “We wanted to help defend both campaigns, because we wanted to preserve the integrity of the election,” says one of the academics, who works at a university that asked him not to speak with reporters because of the sensitive nature of his work.","Hunting for malware requires highly specialized knowledge of the intricacies of the domain name system—the protocol that allows us to type email addresses and website names to initiate communication. DNS enables our words to set in motion a chain of connections between servers, which in turn delivers the results we desire. Before a mail server can deliver a message to another mail server, it has to look up its IP address using the DNS. Computer scientists have built a set of massive DNS databases, which provide fragmentary histories of communications flows, in part to create an archive of malware: a kind of catalog of the tricks bad actors have tried to pull, which often involve masquerading as legitimate actors. These databases can give a useful, though far from comprehensive, snapshot of traffic across the internet. Some of the most trusted DNS specialists—an elite group of malware hunters, who work for private contractors—have access to nearly comprehensive logs of communication between servers. They work in close concert with internet service providers, the networks through which most of us connect to the internet, and the ones that are most vulnerable to massive attacks. To extend the traffic metaphor, these scientists have cameras posted on the internet’s stoplights and overpasses. They are entrusted with something close to a complete record of all the servers of the world connecting with one another.","In late July, one of these scientists—who asked to be referred to as Tea Leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their data—found what looked like malware emanating from Russia. The destination domain had Trump in its name, which of course attracted Tea Leaves’ attention. But his discovery of the data was pure happenstance—a surprising needle in a large haystack of DNS lookups on his screen. “I have an outlier here that connects to Russia in a strange way,” he wrote in his notes. He couldn’t quite figure it out at first. But what he saw was a bank in Moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue.","More data was needed, so he began carefully keeping logs of the Trump server’s DNS activity. As he collected the logs, he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world. Six of them began scrutinizing them for clues.","Trump Tower.","Ullstein Bild/Getty Images","Advertisement","(I communicated extensively with Tea Leaves and two of his closest collaborators, who also spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, since they work for firms trusted by corporations and law enforcement to analyze sensitive data. They persuasively demonstrated some of their analytical methods to me—and showed me two white papers, which they had circulated so that colleagues could check their analysis. I also spoke with academics who vouched for Tea Leaves’ integrity and his unusual access to information. “This is someone I know well and is very well-known in the networking community,” said Camp. “When they say something about DNS, you believe them. This person has technical authority and access to data.”)","The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn’t the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation—conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn’t an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank.","The researchers had initially stumbled in their diagnosis because of the odd configuration of Trump’s server. “I’ve never seen a server set up like that,” says Christopher Davis, who runs the cybersecurity firm HYAS InfoSec Inc. and won a FBI Director Award for Excellence for his work tracking down the authors of one of the world’s nastiest botnet attacks. “It looked weird, and it didn’t pass the sniff test.” The server was first registered to Trump’s business in 2009 and was set up to run consumer marketing campaigns. It had a history of sending mass emails on behalf of Trump-branded properties and products. Researchers were ultimately convinced that the server indeed belonged to Trump. (Click here to see the server’s registration record.) But now this capacious server handled a strangely small load of traffic, such a small load that it would be hard for a company to justify the expense and trouble it would take to maintain it. “I get more mail in a day than the server handled,” Davis says.","“I’ve never seen a server set up like that.”","Christopher Davis of the cybersecurity firm HYAS InfoSec Inc.","That wasn’t the only oddity. When the researchers pinged the server, they received error messages. They concluded that the server was set to accept only incoming communication from a very small handful of IP addresses. A small portion of the logs showed communication with a server belonging to Michigan-based Spectrum Health. (The company said in a statement: “Spectrum Health does not have a relationship with Alfa Bank or any of the Trump organizations. We have concluded a rigorous investigation with both our internal IT security specialists and expert cyber security firms. Our experts have conducted a detailed analysis of the alleged internet traffic and did not find any evidence that it included any actual communications (no emails, chat, text, etc.) between Spectrum Health and Alfa Bank or any of the Trump organizations. While we did find a small number of incoming spam marketing emails, they originated from a digital marketing company, Cendyn, advertising Trump Hotels.”)","Advertisement","Spectrum accounted for a relatively trivial portion of the traffic. Eighty-seven percent of the DNS lookups involved the two Alfa Bank servers. “It’s pretty clear that it’s not an open mail server,” Camp told me. “These organizations are communicating in a way designed to block other people out.”","Earlier this month, the group of computer scientists passed the logs to Paul Vixie. In the world of DNS experts, there’s no higher authority. Vixie wrote central strands of the DNS code that makes the internet work. After studying the logs, he concluded, “The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project.” Put differently, the logs suggested that Trump and Alfa had configured something like a digital hotline connecting the two entities, shutting out the rest of the world, and designed to obscure its own existence. Over the summer, the scientists observed the communications trail from a distance.","* * *","While the researchers went about their work, the conventional wisdom about Russian interference in the campaign began to shift. There were reports that the Trump campaign had ordered the Republican Party to rewrite its platform position on Ukraine, maneuvering the GOP toward a policy preferred by Russia, though the Trump campaign denied having a hand in the change. Then Trump announced in an interview with the New York Times his unwillingness to spring to the defense of NATO allies in the face of a Russian invasion. Trump even invited Russian hackers to go hunting for Clinton’s emails, then passed the comment off as a joke. (I wrote about Trump’s relationship with Russia in early July.)","Advertisement","In the face of accusations that he is somehow backed by Putin or in business with Russian investors, Trump has issued categorical statements. “I mean I have nothing to do with Russia,” he told one reporter, a flat denial that he repeated over and over. Of course, it’s possible that these statements are sincere and even correct. The sweeping nature of Trump’s claim, however, prodded the scientists to dig deeper. They were increasingly confident that they were observing data that contradicted Trump’s claims.","Donald Trump speaks at a rally at in Springfield, Ohio, on Thursday.","Paul Vernon/Getty Images","In the parlance that has become familiar since the Edward Snowden revelations, the DNS logs reside in the realm of metadata. We can see a trail of transmissions, but we can’t see the actual substance of the communications. And we can’t even say with complete certitude that the servers exchanged email. One scientist, who wasn’t involved in the effort to compile and analyze the logs, ticked off a list of other possibilities: an errant piece of spam caroming between servers, a misdirected email that kept trying to reach its destination, which created the impression of sustained communication. “I’m seeing a preponderance of the evidence, but not a smoking gun,” he said. Richard Clayton, a cybersecurity researcher at Cambridge University who was sent one of the white papers laying out the evidence, acknowledges those objections and the alternative theories but considers them improbable. “I think mail is more likely, because it’s going to a machine running a mail server and [the host] is called mail. Dr. Occam says you should rule out mail before pulling out the more exotic explanations.” After Tea Leaves posted his analysis on Reddit, a security blogger who goes by Krypt3ia expressed initial doubts—but his analysis was tarnished by several incorrect assumptions, and as he examined the matter, his skepticism of Tea Leaves softened somewhat.","I put the question of what kind of activity the logs recorded to the University of California’s Nicholas Weaver, another computer scientist not involved in compiling the logs. “I can't attest to the logs themselves,” he told me, “but assuming they are legitimate they do indicate effectively human-level communication.”","Weaver’s statement raises another uncertainty: Are the logs authentic? Computer scientists are careful about vouching for evidence that emerges from unknown sources—especially since the logs were pasted in a text file, where they could conceivably have been edited. I asked nine computer scientists—some who agreed to speak on the record, some who asked for anonymity—if the DNS logs that Tea Leaves and his collaborators discovered could be forged or manipulated. They considered it nearly impossible. It would be easy enough to fake one or maybe even a dozen records of DNS lookups. But in the aggregate, the logs contained thousands of records, with nuances and patterns that not even the most skilled programmers would be able to recreate on this scale. “The data has got the right kind of fuzz growing on it,” Vixie told me. “It’s the interpacket gap, the spacing between the conversations, the total volume. If you look at those time stamps, they are not simulated. This bears every indication that it was collected from a live link.” I asked him if there was a chance that he was wrong about their authenticity. “This passes the reasonable person test,” he told me. “No reasonable person would come to the conclusion other than the one I’ve come to.” Others were equally emphatic. “It would be really, really hard to fake these,” Davis said. According to Camp, “When the technical community examined the data, the conclusion was pretty obvious.”","Advertisement","It’s possible to impute political motives to the computer scientists, some of whom have criticized Trump on social media. But many of the scientists who talked to me for this story are Republicans. And almost all have strong incentives for steering clear of controversy. Some work at public institutions, where they are vulnerable to political pressure. Others work for firms that rely on government contracts—a relationship that tends to squash positions that could be misinterpreted as outspoken.","* * *","The researchers were seeing patterns in the data—and the Trump Organization’s potential interlocutor was itself suggestive. Alfa Bank emerged in the messy post-Soviet scramble to create a private Russian economy. Its founder was a Ukrainian called Mikhail Fridman. He erected his empire in a frenetic rush—in a matter of years, he rose from operating a window washing company to the purchase of the Bolshevik Biscuit Factory to the co-founding of his bank with some friends from university. Fridman could be charmingly open when describing this era. In 2003, he told the Financial Times, “Of course we benefitted from events in the country over the past 10 years. Of course we understand that the distribution of state property was not very objective. … I don’t want to lie and play this game. To say one can be completely clean and transparent is not realistic.”","To build out the bank, Fridman recruited a skilled economist and shrewd operator called Pyotr Aven. In the early ’90s, Aven worked with Vladimir Putin in the St. Petersburg government—and according to several accounts, helped Putin wiggle out of accusations of corruption that might have derailed his ascent. (Karen Dawisha recounts this history in her book Putin’s Kleptocracy.) Over time, Alfa built one of the world’s most lucrative enterprises. Fridman became the second richest man in Russia, valued by Forbes at $15.3 billion.","Alfa’s oligarchs occupied an unusual position in Putin’s firmament. They were insiders but not in the closest ring of power. “It’s like they were his judo pals,” one former U.S. government official who knows Fridman told me. “They were always worried about where they stood in the pecking order and always feared expropriation.” Fridman and Aven, however, are adept at staying close to power. As the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia once ruled, in the course of dismissing a libel suit the bankers filed, “Aven and Fridman have assumed an unforeseen level of prominence and influence in the economic and political affairs of their nation.”","Unlike other Russian firms, Alfa has operated smoothly and effortlessly in the West. It has never been slapped with sanctions. Fridman and Aven have cultivated a reputation as beneficent philanthropists. They endowed a prestigious fellowship. The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the American-government funded think tank, gave Aven its award for “Corporate Citizenship” in 2015. To protect its interests in Washington, Alfa hired as its lobbyist former Reagan administration official Ed Rogers. Richard Burt, who helped Trump write the speech in which he first laid out his foreign policy, previously served on Alfa’s senior advisory board.* The branding campaign has worked well. During the first Obama term, Fridman and Aven met with officials in the White House on two occasions, according to visitor logs.","Fridman and Aven have significant business interests to promote in the West. One of their holding companies, LetterOne, has vowed to invest as much as $3 billion in U.S. health care. This year, it sank $200 million into Uber. This is, of course, money that might otherwise be invested in Russia. According to a former U.S. official, Putin tolerates this condition because Alfa advances Russian interests. It promotes itself as an avatar of Russian prowess. “It’s our moral duty to become a global player, to prove a Russian can transform into an international businessman,” Fridman told the Financial Times.","* * *","Tea Leaves and his colleagues plotted the data from the logs on a timeline. What it illustrated was suggestive: The conversation between the Trump and Alfa servers appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States. “At election-related moments, the traffic peaked,” according to Camp. There were considerably more DNS lookups, for instance, during the two conventions.","In September, the scientists tried to get the public to pay attention to their data. One of them posted a link to the logs in a Reddit thread. Around the same time, the New York Times’ Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers began chasing the story.* (They are still pursuing it.) Lichtblau met with a Washington representative of Alfa Bank on Sept. 21, and the bank denied having any connection to Trump. (Lichtblau told me that Times policy prevents him from commenting on his reporting.)","The Times hadn’t yet been in touch with the Trump campaign—Lichtblau spoke with the campaign a week later—but shortly after it reached out to Alfa, the Trump domain name in question seemed to suddenly stop working. When the scientists looked up the host, the DNS server returned a fail message, evidence that it no longer functioned. Or as it is technically diagnosed, it had “SERVFAILed.” (On the timeline above, this is the moment at the end of the chronology when the traffic abruptly spikes, as servers frantically attempt to resend rejected messages.) The computer scientists believe there was one logical conclusion to be drawn: The Trump Organization shut down the server after Alfa was told that the Times might expose the connection. Weaver told me the Trump domain was “very sloppily removed.” Or as another of the researchers put it, it looked like “the knee was hit in Moscow, the leg kicked in New York.”","As one of the researchers put it, it looked like “the knee was hit in Moscow, the leg kicked in New York.”","Four days later, on Sept. 27, the Trump Organization created a new host name, trump1.contact-client.com, which enabled communication to the very same server via a different route. When a new host name is created, the first communication with it is never random. To reach the server after the resetting of the host name, the sender of the first inbound mail has to first learn of the name somehow. It’s simply impossible to randomly reach a renamed server. “That party had to have some kind of outbound message through SMS, phone, or some noninternet channel they used to communicate [the new configuration],” Paul Vixie told me. The first attempt to look up the revised host name came from Alfa Bank. “If this was a public server, we would have seen other traces,” Vixie says. “The only look-ups came from this particular source.”","According to Vixie and others, the new host name may have represented an attempt to establish a new channel of communication. But media inquiries into the nature of Trump’s relationship with Alfa Bank, which suggested that their communications were being monitored, may have deterred the parties from using it. Soon after the New York Times began to ask questions, the traffic between the servers stopped cold.","* * *","Last week, I wrote to Alfa Bank asking if it could explain why its servers attempted to connect with the Trump Organization on such a regular basis. Its Washington representative, Jeffrey Birnbaum of the public relations firm BGR, provided me the following response:","Alfa hired Mandiant, one of the world's foremost cyber security experts, to investigate and it has found nothing to the allegations. I hope the below answers respond clearly to your questions. Neither Alfa Bank nor its principals, including Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, have or have had any contact with Mr. Trump or his organizations. Fridman and Aven have never met Mr. Trump nor have they or Alfa Bank had any business dealings with him. Neither Alfa nor its officers have sent Mr. Trump or his organizations any emails, information or money. Alfa Bank does not have and has never had any special or exclusive internet connection with Mr. Trump or his entities. The assertion of a special or private link is patently false.","I asked Birnbaum if he would connect me with Mandiant to elaborate on its findings. He told me:","Mandiant is still doing its deep dive into the Alfa Bank systems. Its leading theory is that Alfa Bank's servers may have been responding with common DNS look ups to spam sent to it by a marketing server. But it doesn't want to speak on the record until it's finished its investigation.","It’s hard to evaluate the findings of an investigation that hasn’t ended. And of course, even the most reputable firm in the world isn’t likely to loudly broadcast an opinion that bites the hand of its client.","I posed the same basic questions to the Trump campaign. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks sent me this in response to my questions by email:","The email server, set up for marketing purposes and operated by a third-party, has not been used since 2010. The current traffic on the server from Alphabank's [sic] IP address is regular DNS server traffic—not email traffic. To be clear, The Trump Organization is not sending or receiving any communications from this email server. The Trump Organization has no communication or relationship with this entity or any Russian entity.","I asked Hicks to explain what caused the Trump Organization to rename its host after the New York Times called Alfa. I also asked how the Trump Organization arrived at its judgment that there was no email traffic. (Furthermore, there’s no such thing as “regular” DNS server traffic, at least not according to the computer scientists I consulted. The very reason DNS exists is to enable email and other means of communication.) She never provided me with a response.","What the scientists amassed wasn’t a smoking gun. It’s a suggestive body of evidence that doesn’t absolutely preclude alternative explanations. But this evidence arrives in the broader context of the campaign and everything else that has come to light: The efforts of Donald Trump’s former campaign manager to bring Ukraine into Vladimir Putin’s orbit; the other Trump adviser whose communications with senior Russian officials have worried intelligence officials; the Russian hacking of the DNC and John Podesta’s email.","We don’t yet know what this server was for, but it deserves further explanation.","Update, Oct. 31, 2016: The article has been updated to make clear that the New York Times reporters learned of the logs independently, not from the Reddit thread.

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

But co-workers eventually swayed the CEO, who she described as a \"learn-it-all.\" That change-of-mind informed Facebook's 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for $19 billion.","\"I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong,\" Gleit said.","With Zuckerberg, \"its experiment, learn, experiment, learn,\" said LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who has known him since 2004. Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg's enthusiasm for software, which can be overwritten to fix problems. That facility, he said, makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience.","But in the process of learning, Zuckerberg's inexperience has sometimes played out in public view.","___","In 2010, Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey's television show that he would donate $100 million to schools in Newark, New Jersey.","Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image, just as the biopic \"The Social Network\" was being released. Still, there was little questioning his generosity. The problem was that Zuckerberg — who knew little about education — made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent.","\"He was just a very young, naive, inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet, but just really didn't know much about how the world worked,\" said Dale Russakoff, author of \"The Prize,\" a book chronicling how the money went to high-priced consultants, with minimal effort by leaders to build community support.","By the end of the process, Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done. He and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals, like a $3 billion investment to cure, prevent or manage all diseases. He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy.","\"Zuck's maturation has occurred in front of the public,\" said Kirkpatrick, author of \"The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World.\" ''But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature.\"","At Facebook, Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals, which includes purchasing competitors — or companies that could grow into competitors.","Facebook's $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012 — then unprofitable and little-known — came as a shock to Wall Street. Two years later came the multibillion-dollar deal to buy WhatsApp, a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U.S.","In 2014, soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus, Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets. Under questioning, he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen, and his vision of growing it so fast \"that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists.\"","Last year, in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy, Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook's stock, allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control. That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors' stakes. Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit, the company dropped the plan.","The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg, who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don't always align.","The paradox is self-inflicted, the trade-off for creating a venture premised on users' willingness to share details of their lives. That requires Zuckerberg, who has 105 million Facebook \"friends,\" to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO, whether its photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year.","Yet he fiercely guards his privacy.","When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee, the company sent its lawyer. And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year, they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians — withdrawn after protests — that would have cut off locals' access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate's boundaries.","Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business.","Stops on last year's U.S. tour, never announced, were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few. But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional-quality photos on Zuckerberg's Facebook page soon after he'd departed.","Ostensibly, the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn. But in their brief interactions, many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him.","In Hazard, Kentucky, educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town's biggest secret. A staffer from Zuckerberg's foundation, peppering Green with questions about the region's educational cooperative, finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit. Green's reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide-eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming.","Walking through science demonstrations, Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers.","\"He just lit up with those kids,\" Green said. \"The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology, it really was cool.\"","When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston, North Dakota, last July, \"from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car, he was nothing but questions,\" said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which arranged the visit.","\"I had Bakken shale, limestone, dolomite, and he was able to hold them in his hand, along with a bottle of crude oil. And I remember him asking, 'How do you get that oil out of that rock?'\" geologist Kathleen Neset said.","In Dayton, Ohio, Zuckerberg met with officials, caregivers and families battling drug addiction. Lori Erion, the founder of the group Families of Addicts, said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter, April, had shot up heroin in their own home.","\"It seemed to get him really emotional,\" Erion said, recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself. When he returned, he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment.","\"We didn't ever talk about Facebook at all,\" Erion said, \"which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out. He really was just like a regular person.\"","___","As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face-to-face, controversy over Facebook continued to spiral.","Shortly before the election, McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended. It wasn't just about the U.S. election: A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments, and critics had detected a well-organized, clandestine campaign supporting Brexit.","All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook — that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform.","McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since.","Facebook has adopted this \"libertarian philosophy that says 'we are not responsible for anything downstream, we are allowed to disrupt media, we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that,'\" he said.","Zuckerberg could change that. But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through. And tweaking Facebook's newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive.","\"You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place, which is what Zuck recommends,\" McNamee wrote in an email.","Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes, but Zuckerberg's supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen.","Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset, making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment — without completely shutting out inflammatory content.","\"Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave. That's a very democratic argument. If people want to live in filter bubbles, who are we to say 'Don't live in filter bubbles,' even though we don't want them to?\" Hoffman said.","But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities. The company can't be fixed, Kirkpatrick said, until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business — its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users.","\"There's no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing,\" he said. \"However, I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world. And I also don't think he realizes the extent to which that really is true.\"","McNamee, recalling Zuckerberg as a 22-year-old visionary, said the CEO must be willing to rethink long-held assumptions. But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community.","\"You've won,\" McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel.","\"You've achieved more than your wildest dreams. You're a billionaire. Now you have a chance to be a hero.\""],"isopubdate":""}

If forty thousand people scattered across Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had changed their minds about Donald Trump before 8 November 2016, and cast their votes instead for Hillary Clinton, this small London-based political consultancy would not now be the subject of breathless headlines and Downing Street statements. Cambridge Analytica could have harvested, breached, brain-washed and honey-trapped to their evil hearts’ content, but if Clinton had won, it wouldn’t be a story.","The villains of the piece would no doubt agree with this assessment, but not for very plausible reasons. The exposé conducted by Channel 4 News, with the support of the Observer and the New York Times, captured the now suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, bragging to someone he believed was a potential client that he’d met Trump ‘many times’ and master-minded the entire Trump campaign strategy. Nix implies that those forty thousand votes were scientifically wrested from Hillary and delivered to Trump thanks to micro-targeted advertising and some especially persuasive messaging. ‘Our data informed all the strategy,’ Nix says, with the swagger of an estate agent reporting that demand for period features is red-hot right now.","It’s true that Cambridge Analytica was recruited to work on the Trump campaign, though not necessarily because of its Machiavellian brilliance. Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign manager, was on the board of the company at the time, and probably tossed it a contract for some data analysis so as to keep things between friends. When the company first attracted attention in the British media in early 2017, it was reported as also having had close ties to the Leave campaign. In one of several investigative reports on the topic, the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr wrote in May 2017 that ‘what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play.’","Against that heady backdrop, the more recent revelations must register as something of an anticlimax, not least for Cambridge Analytica’s more gullible clients. First, there is no firm evidence that Cambridge Analytica provided consultancy services to any of the major players in the EU referendum of 2016. Nix initially bragged in an article that it had, but confessed to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in February this year that the article had been drafted by a ‘slightly overzealous PR consultant’. Certainly we should try to understand how ‘Brexit and Trump are entwined,’ but that requires sociological and economic analysis: the process won’t be as simple (or as exciting) as identifying a secret control room.","Second, there is not – and cannot be – any evidence that it swung the election for Trump (by the same token, it isn’t strictly provable that it didn’t), though unsurprisingly the company claims otherwise. This still appears painful for Clinton herself to accept. Interviewed for one of the Channel 4 reports, she speaks of Cambridge Analytica’s ‘massive propaganda effort [which] affected the thought processes of voters’. And yet data analysis is at the heart of modern political campaigning. Clinton, after all, preferred to study data on Michigan from the comfort of her Brooklyn campaign office than actually to visit the state, even as panicking Michigan Democrats pleaded with her to spend time there in the final weeks. If things had turned out differently, there would no doubt have been star-struck puff pieces on the bleeding edge data analytics that were behind the election of America’s first female president.","The scandal is twofold, but neither part really concerns elections. The first is the ‘data breach’, which granted the Trump campaign access to fifty million Facebook profiles without the users’ permission. This occurred by means of the abuse of a simple app called thisisyourdigitallife, the like of which many Facebook users will have come across. Apps such as this appear in a user’s newsfeed as a personality questionnaire, producing relatively banal results which can then be shared with friends. Thisisyourdigitallife was built by Aleksandr Kogan, a psychologist at Cambridge University, to test theories of personality-modelling on the basis of Facebook ‘likes’. Only 270,000 people ever used the app, but it also collected data on their friends – a feature of how Facebook works, rather than of Kogan’s wizardry.","Facebook knew of thisisyourdigitallife, but was under the impression it was geared purely towards academic research. Any user who checked the terms and conditions (and who among us ever does that?) would have thought the same. What nobody knew until earlier this month was that Kogan was passing the data straight to Cambridge Analytica, which was then putting it to work for Bannon. All of this was told to the Observer by a whistle-blower at Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie: the story appeared under the headline, ‘I made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool.’","Various rules were broken. Privacy law assumes that individuals have the right to know what their data is being used for before they agree that someone may collect and keep it. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were being dishonest and secretive. But while they may not have been true to every letter of their Ts and Cs, and may be in breach of the Data Protection Act, no one, surely, will be surprised to discover that data collected in one arena is put to work in another. Using data in novel (and secretive) ways is virtually the governing principle of the digital economy – what Shoshana Zuboff has termed ‘surveillance capitalism’, and Nick Srnicek calls ‘platform capitalism’.","It’s worth remembering that throughout the 1990s, the internet was viewed as a threat to capitalism as much as an opportunity. Napster was the iconic example. It wasn’t clear where the profits lay, once information was abundant and individual anonymity was the norm. What changed, as Zuboff and Srnicek both explore in different ways, was that the internet began to be treated as a surveillance device of potentially global proportions: cheaper, better or free services were provided on condition that the ‘user’ would be tracked in everything they did and anchored in their offline identity. The fact that most tech giants made – and in Uber’s case still make – vast losses for the first few years of their existence is integral to this strategy. People must be lured into using a service and then kept using it by whatever means necessary; only later is this power converted into revenue.","To suggest that a Facebook user consents to all the ways Facebook uses or might use their data is completely to misrepresent the logic at work here. For that matter, to say that a Guardian reader consents to all the ways the Guardian uses their data (which they deposit every time they visit the website) is to misunderstand the essentially malleable nature of data itself. Its potential value and use emerges after one has collected it, not before.","In the panic surrounding Trump and Cambridge Analytica, this brute capitalist reality has been mysteriously referred to as ‘harvesting’. But if creating an app to collect data without people’s conscious knowledge is ‘harvesting’, then so is a great deal else. By creating free wifi on the London Underground, Transport for London is harvesting data (the wifi network was installed to provide TfL with real-time data on passenger movements). The UK Government Digital Service has harvested data on citizens by manipulating the design of government websites (the common practice of ‘A/B’ testing means different users see different website designs, with data collected on how this affects click-throughs and time spent on each page). Uber harvests data well beyond car journeys (the app continues to collect data on passenger behaviour after a ride has finished, although users can now opt out of this). New digital advertising billboards at Piccadilly Circus are harvesting data (they contain cameras to analyse the facial expressions of people in the crowds passing by).","The second aspect of the recent scandal is grubbier but ultimately less significant. If its own sales pitch is to be believed (an ‘if’ that grows larger by the day), Cambridge Analytica likes to play dirty. Nix and his colleague Mark Turnbull were caught by Channel 4 discussing techniques of honey-trapping, blackmail and counter-intelligence in a manner that owed more to James Bond plots than to psychometrics. Throwaway remarks, that the candidate is just a ‘puppet’ to the campaign team and that ‘facts’ are less important than ‘emotion’, look shady when caught on a hidden camera, but they’re not categorically different from the early ruthlessness of New Labour operators such as Alastair Campbell, Philip Gould and Peter Mandelson. Nor is there any reason to assume that New Labour’s 1990 analogue methods of data analysis – focus group and polling – are less informative or useful than automated psychometrics. As for Nix’s boast that they ‘operate in the shadows’, and his parting shot to the ‘client’ (‘I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you’), it’s a wonder the Channel 4 investigator managed to keep a straight face.","So we have a misuse of data, which has rightly attracted the attention of the Information Commissioner’s Office, and some excitable marketing patter, which slips into Mafia fantasy before being swiftly retracted at the first sign of actual danger. The former issue isn’t exactly news: in 2010 the Wall Street Journal found that Facebook apps (such as the one built by Kogan) were routinely collecting information for the benefit of advertisers and internet tracking companies, without users’ consent. Given Facebook’s command of the world’s attention (more than two billion monthly active users, who spend an average of fifty minutes on the site every day), it is inevitable that attention merchants flock to the site in search of the scraps, just as major sporting events attract ticket touts.","Why so much outrage? The Observer should be congratulated for its tenacity on the topic, and this story may, with luck, push us towards a tipping point on the issue of data privacy. But the fascination and shock that Cambridge Analytica is attracting suggests a displacement of horror that really stems from something deeper. Part of that must lie with Trump and Trumpism. A terrible event must surely have been delivered by equally terrible means. Passionate Remainers no doubt feel similarly about Brexit. It is clear that various secretive and underhand forces did intervene in the US election campaign. Thanks to Robert Mueller’s investigation, we know that Facebook sold $100,000-worth of advertising space to Russian ‘troll farms’, and that 126 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian ‘fake news’ over the course of 2015 and 2016. Then there is the FBI’s resurrection of the matter of Clinton’s emails at a critical moment in the election campaign. Whether any of this gets us closer to explaining or understanding Trump’s victory is moot.","Cambridge Analytica looks conveniently like a smoking gun, primarily because it has repeatedly bragged that it is one. Nix and Turnbull do for the events of 2016 what ‘Fabulous’ Fab Tourre, former Goldman Sachs banker, and Fred ‘The Shred’ Goodwin, former boss of RBS, did for the banking crisis of 2008, providing grotesque personalities on which to focus anger and alarm. To hear such men proudly declaring their lack of moral conscience is paradoxically reassuring to the degree that it helps explain the world’s loss of moral direction. But as with the financial crisis, the circus risks distracting from the real institutional and political questions, in this case concerning companies such as Facebook and the model of capitalism that tolerates, facilitates and even celebrates their extensive and sophisticated forms of data harvesting and analysis.","It is telling that two of the greatest ethical scandals to have hit Facebook in recent years both involved academics, the previous one being the ‘emotional contagion’ experiment, in which it transpired that Facebook had altered newsfeeds without consent, as part of a scientific study. Engaging with external researchers means surrendering a tiny modicum of control. Facebook’s willingness to co-operate with academics is already slight, and these scandals will make Mark Zuckerberg wonder if it could ever be worth the bother. Keep all the data in-house and the question of ethics doesn’t arise. The increasing size and scope of these giant platforms gradually eliminates the need ever to share valuable data with anyone else.","It’s sometimes said that data is the ‘oil’ of the digital economy, the resource that fuels everything else. A more helpful analogy is between oil and privacy, a concealed natural resource that is progressively plundered for private profit, with increasingly harmful consequences for society at large. If this analogy is correct, privacy and data protection laws won’t be enough to fight the tech giants with. Destroying privacy in ever more adventurous ways is what Facebook does.","Just as environmentalists demand that the fossil fuel industry ‘leave it in the ground,’ the ultimate demand to be levelled at Silicon Valley should be ‘leave it in our heads.’ The real villain here is an expansionary economic logic that insists on inspecting ever more of our thoughts, feelings and relationships. The best way to thwart this is the one Silicon Valley fears the most: anti-trust laws. Broken into smaller pieces, these companies would still be able to monitor us, but from disparate perspectives that couldn’t easily (or secretly) be joined up. Better a world full of snake-oil merchants like Cambridge Analytica, who eventually get caught out by their own bullshit, than a world of vast corporate monopolies such as Amazon and Facebook, gradually taking on the functions of government, while remaining eerily quiet about what they’re doing."],"isopubdate":""}
{"originalurl":"https://www.eugdpr.org/the-regulation.html","title":"Key Changes with the General Data Protection Regulation – EUGDPR","text":["GDPR Key Changes","An overview of the main changes under GDPR and how they differ from the previous directive","The aim of the GDPR is to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches in today’s data-driven world. Although the key principles of data privacy still hold true to the previous directive, many changes have been proposed to the regulatory policies; the key points of the GDPR as well as information on the impacts it will have on business can be found below.","Increased Territorial Scope (extraterritorial applicability)\nArguably the biggest change to the regulatory landscape of data privacy comes with the extended jurisdiction of the GDPR, as it applies to all companies processing the personal data of data subjects residing in the Union, regardless of the company’s location. Previously, territorial applicability of the directive was ambiguous and referred to data process ‘in context of an establishment’. This topic has arisen in a number of high profile court cases. GDPR makes its applicability very clear – it applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. The GDPR also applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects in the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the activities relate to: offering goods or services to EU citizens (irrespective of whether payment is required) and the monitoring of behaviour that takes place within the EU. Non-EU businesses processing the data of EU citizens also have to appoint a representative in the EU.","Penalties\nOrganizations in breach of GDPR can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 Million (whichever is greater). This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements e.g.not having sufficient customer consent to process data or violating the core of Privacy by Design concepts. There is a tiered approach to fines e.g. a company can be fined 2% for not having their records in order (article 28), not notifying the supervising authority and data subject about a breach or not conducting impact assessment. It is important to note that these rules apply to both controllers and processors – meaning ‘clouds’ are not exempt from GDPR enforcement.","Consent\nThe conditions for consent have been strengthened, and companies are no longer able to use long illegible terms and conditions full of legalese. The request for consent must be given in an intelligible and easily accessible form, with the purpose for data processing attached to that consent. Consent must be clear and distinguishable from other matters and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.​","Data Subject Rights","Breach NotificationUnder the GDPR, breach notifications are now mandatory in all member states where a data breach is likely to “result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals”. This must be done within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach. Data processors are also required to notify their customers, the controllers, “without undue delay” after first becoming aware of a data breach.","Right to Access\nPart of the expanded rights of data subjects outlined by the GDPR is the right for data subjects to obtain confirmation from the data controller as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose. Further, the controller shall provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format. This change is a dramatic shift to data transparency and empowerment of data subjects.","Right to be Forgotten\nAlso known as Data Erasure, the right to be forgotten entitles the data subject to have the data controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data. The conditions for erasure, as outlined in article 17, include the data no longer being relevant to original purposes for processing, or a data subject withdrawing consent. It should also be noted that this right requires controllers to compare the subjects’ rights to “the public interest in the availability of the data” when considering such requests.","Data Portability\nGDPR introduces data portability – the right for a data subject to receive the personal data concerning them – which they have previously provided in a ‘commonly use and machine readable format’ and have the right to transmit that data to another controller.","Privacy by Design\nPrivacy by design as a concept has existed for years, but it is only just becoming part of a legal requirement with the GDPR. At its core, privacy by design calls for the inclusion of data protection from the onset of the designing of systems, rather than an addition. More specifically, ‘The controller shall… implement appropriate technical and organisational measures… in an effective way… in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects’. Article 23 calls for controllers to hold and process only the data absolutely necessary for the completion of its duties (data minimisation), as well as limiting the access to personal data to those needing to act out the processing.","Data Protection Officers\nUnder GDPR it is not necessary to submit notifications / registrations to each local DPA of data processing activities, nor is it a requirement to notify / obtain approval for transfers based on the Model Contract Clauses (MCCs). Instead, there are internal record keeping requirements, as further explained below, and DPO appointment is mandatory only for those controllers and processors whose core activities consist of processing operations which require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale or of special categories of data or data relating to criminal convictions and offences. Importantly, the Data Protection Officer:","Must be appointed on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge on data protection law and practices","May be a staff member or an external service provider","Contact details must be provided to the relevant DPA","Must be provided with appropriate resources to carry out their tasks and maintain their expert knowledge","Must report directly to the highest level of management","Must not carry out any other tasks that could results in a conflict of interest.​","​Disclaimer: This is not an official EU Commission or Government resource.

{"originalurl":"http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/","title":"GraphQL","text":["GraphQL","Current Working Draft","Introduction","This is the specification for GraphQL, a query language and execution engine originally created at Facebook in 2012 for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models for client‐server applications. The development of this open standard started in 2015.","GraphQL has evolved and may continue to evolve in future editions of this specification. Previous editions of the GraphQL specification can be found at permalinks that match their release tag. The latest working draft release can be found at facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/.","As of September 26, 2017, the following persons or entities have made this Specification available under the Open Web Foundation Final Specification Agreement (OWFa 1.0), which is available at openwebfoundation.org.","Facebook, Inc.","You can review the signed copies of the Open Web Foundation Final Specification Agreement Version 1.0 for this specification at github.com/facebook/graphql, which may also include additional parties to those listed above.","Your use of this Specification may be subject to other third party rights. THIS SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” The contributors expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non‐infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification.

Conformance requirements are described in this document via both descriptive assertions and key words with clearly defined meanings.","The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative portions of this document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119. These key words may appear in lowercase and still retain their meaning unless explicitly declared as non‐normative.","A conforming implementation of GraphQL may provide additional functionality, but must not where explicitly disallowed or would otherwise result in non‐conformance.","Conforming Algorithms","Algorithm steps phrased in imperative grammar (e.g. “Return the result of calling resolver”) are to be interpreted with the same level of requirement as the algorithm it is contained within. Any algorithm referenced within an algorithm step (e.g. “Let completedResult be the result of calling CompleteValue()”) is to be interpreted as having at least the same level of requirement as the algorithm containing that step.","Conformance requirements expressed as algorithms can be fulfilled by an implementation of this specification in any way as long as the perceived result is equivalent. Algorithms described in this document are written to be easy to understand. Implementers are encouraged to include equivalent but optimized implementations.","See Appendix A for more details about the definition of algorithms and other notational conventions used in this document.","Non‐Normative Portions","All contents of this document are normative except portions explicitly declared as non‐normative.","Examples in this document are non‐normative, and are presented to aid understanding of introduced concepts and the behavior of normative portions of the specification. Examples are either introduced explicitly in prose (e.g. “for example”) or are set apart in example or counter‐example blocks, like this:","Notes in this document are non‐normative, and are presented to clarify intent, draw attention to potential edge‐cases and pit‐falls, and answer common questions that arise during implementation. Notes are either introduced explicitly in prose (e.g. “Note: “) or are set apart in a note block, like this:","GraphQL is not a programming language capable of arbitrary computation, but is instead a language used to query application servers that have capabilities defined in this specification. GraphQL does not mandate a particular programming language or storage system for application servers that implement it. Instead, application servers take their capabilities and map them to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes. This provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful platform for tool‐building.","GraphQL has a number of design principles:","Hierarchical: Most product development today involves the creation and manipulation of view hierarchies. To achieve congruence with the structure of these applications, a GraphQL query itself is structured hierarchically. The query is shaped just like the data it returns. It is a natural way for clients to describe data requirements.","Product‐centric: GraphQL is unapologetically driven by the requirements of views and the front‐end engineers that write them. GraphQL starts with their way of thinking and requirements and builds the language and runtime necessary to enable that.","Strong‐typing: Every GraphQL server defines an application‐specific type system. Queries are executed within the context of that type system. Given a query, tools can ensure that the query is both syntactically correct and valid within the GraphQL type system before execution, i.e. at development time, and the server can make certain guarantees about the shape and nature of the response.","Client‐specified queries: Through its type system, a GraphQL server publishes the capabilities that its clients are allowed to consume. It is the client that is responsible for specifying exactly how it will consume those published capabilities. These queries are specified at field‐level granularity. In the majority of client‐server applications written without GraphQL, the server determines the data returned in its various scripted endpoints. A GraphQL query, on the other hand, returns exactly what a client asks for and no more.","Introspective: GraphQL is introspective. A GraphQL server’s type system must be queryable by the GraphQL language itself, as will be described in this specification. GraphQL introspection serves as a powerful platform for building common tools and client software libraries.","Because of these principles, GraphQL is a powerful and productive environment for building client applications. Product developers and designers building applications against working GraphQL servers -- supported with quality tools -- can quickly become productive without reading extensive documentation and with little or no formal training. To enable that experience, there must be those that build those servers and tools.","The following formal specification serves as a reference for those builders. It describes the language and its grammar, the type system and the introspection system used to query it, and the execution and validation engines with the algorithms to power them. The goal of this specification is to provide a foundation and framework for an ecosystem of GraphQL tools, client libraries, and server implementations -- spanning both organizations and platforms -- that has yet to be built. We look forward to working with the community in order to do that.","Clients use the GraphQL query language to make requests to a GraphQL service. We refer to these request sources as documents. A document may contain operations (queries, mutations, and subscriptions) as well as fragments, a common unit of composition allowing for query reuse.","A GraphQL document is defined as a syntactic grammar where terminal symbols are tokens (indivisible lexical units). These tokens are defined in a lexical grammar which matches patterns of source characters (defined by a double‐colon ::).","See Appendix A for more details about the definition of lexical and syntactic grammar and other notational conventions used in this document.","GraphQL documents are expressed as a sequence of Unicode characters. However, with few exceptions, most of GraphQL is expressed only in the original non‐control ASCII range so as to be as widely compatible with as many existing tools, languages, and serialization formats as possible and avoid display issues in text editors and source control.","Non‐ASCII Unicode characters may freely appear within StringValue and Comment portions of GraphQL.","The “Byte Order Mark” is a special Unicode character which may appear at the beginning of a file containing Unicode which programs may use to determine the fact that the text stream is Unicode, what endianness the text stream is in, and which of several Unicode encodings to interpret.","White space is used to improve legibility of source text and act as separation between tokens, and any amount of white space may appear before or after any token. White space between tokens is not significant to the semantic meaning of a GraphQL Document, however white space characters may appear within a String or Comment token.","GraphQL intentionally does not consider Unicode “Zs” category characters as white‐space, avoiding misinterpretation by text editors and source control tools.","Like white space, line terminators are used to improve the legibility of source text, any amount may appear before or after any other token and have no significance to the semantic meaning of a GraphQL Document. Line terminators are not found within any other token.","Any error reporting which provide the line number in the source of the offending syntax should use the preceding amount of LineTerminator to produce the line number.","Similar to white space and line terminators, commas (,) are used to improve the legibility of source text and separate lexical tokens but are otherwise syntactically and semantically insignificant within GraphQL Documents.","Non‐significant comma characters ensure that the absence or presence of a comma does not meaningfully alter the interpreted syntax of the document, as this can be a common user‐error in other languages. It also allows for the stylistic use of either trailing commas or line‐terminators as list delimiters which are both often desired for legibility and maintainability of source code.","Before and after every lexical token may be any amount of ignored tokens including WhiteSpace and Comment. No ignored regions of a source document are significant, however ignored source characters may appear within a lexical token in a significant way, for example a String may contain white space characters.","No characters are ignored while parsing a given token, as an example no white space characters are permitted between the characters defining a FloatValue.","GraphQL documents include punctuation in order to describe structure. GraphQL is a data description language and not a programming language, therefore GraphQL lacks the punctuation often used to describe mathematical expressions.","A GraphQL Document describes a complete file or request string operated on by a GraphQL service or client. A document contains multiple definitions, either executable or representative of a GraphQL type system.","If a Document contains only one operation, that operation may be unnamed or represented in the shorthand form, which omits both the query keyword and operation name. Otherwise, if a GraphQL Document contains multiple operations, each operation must be named. When submitting a Document with multiple operations to a GraphQL service, the name of the desired operation to be executed must also be provided.","If a document contains only one query operation, and that query defines no variables and contains no directives, that operation may be represented in a short‐hand form which omits the query keyword and query name.","For example, this unnamed query operation is written via query shorthand.","A selection set is primarily composed of fields. A field describes one discrete piece of information available to request within a selection set.","Some fields describe complex data or relationships to other data. In order to further explore this data, a field may itself contain a selection set, allowing for deeply nested requests. All GraphQL operations must specify their selections down to fields which return scalar values to ensure an unambiguously shaped response.","For example, this operation selects fields of complex data and relationships down to scalar values.","Fields in the top‐level selection set of an operation often represent some information that is globally accessible to your application and its current viewer. Some typical examples of these top fields include references to a current logged‐in viewer, or accessing certain types of data referenced by a unique identifier.","Example № 9# `me` could represent the currently logged in viewer.{\nme {\nname\n}}# `user` represents one of many users in a graph of data, referred to by a# unique identifier.{\nuser(id:4){\nname\n}}","Fields are conceptually functions which return values, and occasionally accept arguments which alter their behavior. These arguments often map directly to function arguments within a GraphQL server’s implementation.","In this example, we want to query a specific user (requested via the id argument) and their profile picture of a specific size:","Fragments allow for the reuse of common repeated selections of fields, reducing duplicated text in the document. Inline Fragments can be used directly within a selection to condition upon a type condition when querying against an interface or union.","For example, if we wanted to fetch some common information about mutual friends as well as friends of some user:","Fragments are consumed by using the spread operator (...). All fields selected by the fragment will be added to the query field selection at the same level as the fragment invocation. This happens through multiple levels of fragment spreads.","The profiles root field returns a list where each element could be a Page or a User. When the object in the profiles result is a User, friends will be present and likers will not. Conversely when the result is a Page, likers will be present and friends will not.","Fragments can be defined inline within a selection set. This is done to conditionally include fields based on their runtime type. This feature of standard fragment inclusion was demonstrated in the query FragmentTyping example. We could accomplish the same thing using inline fragments.","Strings are sequences of characters wrapped in double‐quotes (\"). (ex. \"Hello World\"). White space and other otherwise‐ignored characters are significant within a string value.","Unicode characters are allowed within String value literals, however SourceCharacter must not contain some ASCII control characters so escape sequences must be used to represent these characters.","Block Strings","Block strings are sequences of characters wrapped in triple‐quotes (\"\"\"). White space, line terminators, quote, and backslash characters may all be used unescaped to enable verbatim text. Characters must all be valid SourceCharacter.","Since block strings represent freeform text often used in indented positions, the string value semantics of a block string excludes uniform indentation and blank initial and trailing lines via BlockStringValue().","Since block string values strip leading and trailing empty lines, there is no single canonical printed block string for a given value. Because block strings typically represent freeform text, it is considered easier to read if they begin and end with an empty line.","Example № 27\"\"\"\nThis starts with and ends with an empty line,\nwhich makes it easier to read.\n\"\"\"","Counter Example № 28\"\"\"This does not start with or end with any empty lines,\nwhich makes it a little harder to read.\"\"\"","If non‐printable ASCII characters are needed in a string value, a standard quoted string with appropriate escape sequences must be used instead of a block string.","The first has explictly provided null to the argument “arg”, while the second has implicitly not provided a value to the argument “arg”. These two forms may be interpreted differently. For example, a mutation representing deleting a field vs not altering a field, respectively. Neither form may be used for an input expecting a Non‐Null type.","The same two methods of representing the lack of a value are possible via variables by either providing the a variable value as null and not providing a variable value at all.","Enum values are represented as unquoted names (ex. MOBILE_WEB). It is recommended that Enum values be “all caps”. Enum values are only used in contexts where the precise enumeration type is known. Therefore it’s not necessary to supply an enumeration type name in the literal.","Values for those variables are provided to a GraphQL service along with a request so they may be substituted during execution. If providing JSON for the variables’ values, we could run this query and request profilePic of size 60 width:","Query variables can be used within fragments. Query variables have global scope with a given operation, so a variable used within a fragment must be declared in any top‐level operation that transitively consumes that fragment. If a variable is referenced in a fragment and is included by an operation that does not define that variable, the operation cannot be executed.","Directives provide a way to describe alternate runtime execution and type validation behavior in a GraphQL document.","In some cases, you need to provide options to alter GraphQL’s execution behavior in ways field arguments will not suffice, such as conditionally including or skipping a field. Directives provide this by describing additional information to the executor.","Directives have a name along with a list of arguments which may accept values of any input type.","Directives can be used to describe additional information for types, fields, fragments and operations.","As future versions of GraphQL adopt new configurable execution capabilities, they may be exposed via directives.","The GraphQL Type system describes the capabilities of a GraphQL server and is used to determine if a query is valid. The type system also describes the input types of query variables to determine if values provided at runtime are valid.","The GraphQL language includes an IDL used to describe a GraphQL service’s type system. Tools may use this definition language to provide utilities such as client code generation or service boot‐strapping.","GraphQL tools which only seek to provide GraphQL query execution may choose not to parse TypeSystemDefinition.","A GraphQL Document which contains TypeSystemDefinition must not be executed; GraphQL execution services which receive a GraphQL Document containing type system definitions should return a descriptive error.","The type system definition language is used throughout the remainder of this specification document when illustrating example type systems.","Type system extensions are used to represent a GraphQL type system which has been extended from some original type system. For example, this might be used by a local service to represent data a GraphQL client only accesses locally, or by a GraphQL service which is itself an extension of another GraphQL service.","A GraphQL service’s collective type system capabilities are referred to as that service’s “schema”. A schema is defined in terms of the types and directives it supports as well as the root operation types for each kind of operation: query, mutation, and subscription; this determines the place in the type system where those operations begin.","A GraphQL schema must itself be internally valid. This section describes the rules for this validation process where relevant.","All types within a GraphQL schema must have unique names. No two provided types may have the same name. No provided type may have a name which conflicts with any built in types (including Scalar and Introspection types).","All directives within a GraphQL schema must have unique names.","All types and directives defined within a schema must not have a name which begins with \"__\" (two underscores), as this is used exclusively by GraphQL’s introspection system.","While any type can be the root operation type for a GraphQL operation, the type system definition language can omit the schema definition when the query, mutation, and subscription root types are named Query, Mutation, and Subscription respectively.","Likewise, when representing a GraphQL schema using the type system definition language, a schema definition should be omitted if it only uses the default root operation type names.","This example describes a valid complete GraphQL schema, despite not explicitly including a schema definition. The Query type is presumed to be the query root operation type of the schema.","Schema extensions are used to represent a schema which has been extended from an original schema. For example, this might be used by a GraphQL service which adds additional operation types, or additional directives to an existing schema.","Schema Validation","Schema extensions have the potential to be invalid if incorrectly defined.","The Schema must already be defined.","Any directives provided must not already apply to the original Schema.","Documentation is first‐class feature of GraphQL type systems. To ensure the documentation of a GraphQL service remains consistent with its capabilities, descriptions of GraphQL definitions are provided alongside their definitions and made available via introspection.","To allow GraphQL service designers to easily publish documentation alongside the capabilities of a GraphQL service, GraphQL descriptions are defined using the Markdown syntax (as specified by CommonMark). In the type system definition language, these description strings (often BlockString) occur immediately before the definition they describe.","All GraphQL types, fields, arguments and other definitions which can be described should provide a Description unless they are considered self descriptive.","As an example, this simple GraphQL schema is well described:","Example № 39\"\"\"\nA simple GraphQL schema which is well described.\n\"\"\"\ntype Query {\"\"\"\nTranslates a string from a given language into a different language.\n\"\"\"\ntranslate(\"The original language that `text` is provided in.\"fromLanguage: Language\n\"The translated language to be returned.\"toLanguage: Language\n\"The text to be translated.\"text: String\n): String\n}\"\"\"\nThe set of languages supported by `translate`.\n\"\"\"\nenum Language {\"English\"\nEN\n\"French\"\nFR\n\"Chinese\"\nCH\n}","The fundamental unit of any GraphQL Schema is the type. There are six kinds of named type definitions in GraphQL, and two wrapping types.","The most basic type is a Scalar. A scalar represents a primitive value, like a string or an integer. Oftentimes, the possible responses for a scalar field are enumerable. GraphQL offers an Enum type in those cases, where the type specifies the space of valid responses.","Scalars and Enums form the leaves in response trees; the intermediate levels are Object types, which define a set of fields, where each field is another type in the system, allowing the definition of arbitrary type hierarchies.","GraphQL supports two abstract types: interfaces and unions.","An Interface defines a list of fields; Object types that implement that interface are guaranteed to implement those fields. Whenever the type system claims it will return an interface, it will return a valid implementing type.","A Union defines a list of possible types; similar to interfaces, whenever the type system claims a union will be returned, one of the possible types will be returned.","Finally, oftentimes it is useful to provide complex structs as inputs to GraphQL field arguments or variables; the Input Object type allows the schema to define exactly what data is expected.","All of the types so far are assumed to be both nullable and singular: e.g. a scalar string returns either null or a singular string.","A GraphQL schema may describe that a field represents list of another types; the List type is provided for this reason, and wraps another type.","Similarly, the Non-Null type wraps another type, and denotes that the resulting value will never be null (and that an error cannot result in a null value).","These two types are referred to as “wrapping types”; non‐wrapping types are referred to as “named types”. A wrapping type has an underlying named type, found by continually unwrapping the type until a named type is found.","Types are used throughout GraphQL to describe both the values accepted as input to arguments and variables as well as the values output by fields. These two uses categorize types as input types and output types. Some kinds of types, like Scalar and Enum types, can be used as both input types and output types; other kinds types can only be used in one or the other. Input Object types can only be used as input types. Object, Interface, and Union types can only be used as output types. Lists and Non‐Null types may be used as input types or output types depending on how the wrapped type may be used.","Type extensions are used to represent a GraphQL type which has been extended from some original type. For example, this might be used by a local service to represent additional fields a GraphQL client only accesses locally.","Scalar types represent primitive leaf values in a GraphQL type system. GraphQL responses take the form of a hierarchical tree; the leaves on these trees are GraphQL scalars.","All GraphQL scalars are representable as strings, though depending on the response format being used, there may be a more appropriate primitive for the given scalar type, and server should use those types when appropriate.","GraphQL provides a number of built‐in scalars, but type systems can add additional scalars with semantic meaning. For example, a GraphQL system could define a scalar called Time which, while serialized as a string, promises to conform to ISO‐8601. When querying a field of type Time, you can then rely on the ability to parse the result with an ISO‐8601 parser and use a client‐specific primitive for time. Another example of a potentially useful custom scalar is Url, which serializes as a string, but is guaranteed by the server to be a valid URL.","A server may omit any of the built‐in scalars from its schema, for example if a schema does not refer to a floating‐point number, then it must not include the Float type. However, if a schema includes a type with the name of one of the types described here, it must adhere to the behavior described. As an example, a server must not include a type called Int and use it to represent 128‐bit numbers, internationalization information, or anything other than what is defined in this document.","When representing a GraphQL schema using the type system definition language, the built‐in scalar types should be omitted for brevity.","Result Coercion","A GraphQL server, when preparing a field of a given scalar type, must uphold the contract the scalar type describes, either by coercing the value or producing a field error if a value cannot be coerced or if coercion may result in data loss.","A GraphQL service may decide to allow coercing different internal types to the expected return type. For example when coercing a field of type Int a boolean true value may produce 1 or a string value \"123\" may be parsed as base‐10 123. However if internal type coercion cannot be reasonably performed without losing information, then it must raise a field error.","Since this coercion behavior is not observable to clients of the GraphQL server, the precise rules of coercion are left to the implementation. The only requirement is that the server must yield values which adhere to the expected Scalar type.","Input Coercion","If a GraphQL server expects a scalar type as input to an argument, coercion is observable and the rules must be well defined. If an input value does not match a coercion rule, a query error must be raised.","GraphQL has different constant literals to represent integer and floating‐point input values, and coercion rules may apply differently depending on which type of input value is encountered. GraphQL may be parameterized by query variables, the values of which are often serialized when sent over a transport like HTTP. Since some common serializations (ex. JSON) do not discriminate between integer and floating‐point values, they are interpreted as an integer input value if they have an empty fractional part (ex. 1.0) and otherwise as floating‐point input value.","For all types below, with the exception of Non‐Null, if the explicit value null is provided, then the result of input coercion is null.","Built‐in Scalars","GraphQL provides a basic set of well‐defined Scalar types. A GraphQL server should support all of these types, and a GraphQL server which provide a type by these names must adhere to the behavior described below.","GraphQL servers may coerce non‐integer internal values to integers when reasonable without losing information, otherwise they must raise a field error. Examples of this may include returning 1 for the floating‐point number 1.0, or returning 123 for the string \"123\". In scenarios where coercion may lose data, raising a field error is more appropriate. For example, a floating‐point number 1.2 should raise a field error instead of being truncated to 1.","If the integer internal value represents a value less than -231 or greater than or equal to 231, a field error should be raised.","Input Coercion","When expected as an input type, only integer input values are accepted. All other input values, including strings with numeric content, must raise a query error indicating an incorrect type. If the integer input value represents a value less than -231 or greater than or equal to 231, a query error should be raised.","Numeric integer values larger than 32‐bit should either use String or a custom‐defined Scalar type, as not all platforms and transports support encoding integer numbers larger than 32‐bit.","The Float scalar type represents signed double‐precision fractional values as specified by IEEE 754. Response formats that support an appropriate double‐precision number type should use that type to represent this scalar.","GraphQL servers may coerce non‐floating‐point internal values to Float when reasonable without losing information, otherwise they must raise a field error. Examples of this may include returning 1.0 for the integer number 1, or 123.0 for the string \"123\".","Input Coercion","When expected as an input type, both integer and float input values are accepted. Integer input values are coerced to Float by adding an empty fractional part, for example 1.0 for the integer input value 1. All other input values, including strings with numeric content, must raise a query error indicating an incorrect type. If the integer input value represents a value not representable by IEEE 754, a query error should be raised.","The String scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF‐8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free‐form human‐readable text. All response formats must support string representations, and that representation must be used here.","GraphQL servers may coerce non‐string raw values to String when reasonable without losing information, otherwise they must raise a field error. Examples of this may include returning the string \"true\" for a boolean true value, or the string \"1\" for the integer 1.","Input Coercion","When expected as an input type, only valid UTF‐8 string input values are accepted. All other input values must raise a query error indicating an incorrect type.","GraphQL servers may coerce non‐boolean raw values to Boolean when reasonable without losing information, otherwise they must raise a field error. Examples of this may include returning true for non‐zero numbers.","Input Coercion","When expected as an input type, only boolean input values are accepted. All other input values must raise a query error indicating an incorrect type.","The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as the key for a cache. The ID type is serialized in the same way as a String; however, it is not intended to be human‐readable. While it is often numeric, it should always serialize as a String.","Result Coercion","GraphQL is agnostic to ID format, and serializes to string to ensure consistency across many formats ID could represent, from small auto‐increment numbers, to large 128‐bit random numbers, to base64 encoded values, or string values of a format like GUID.","GraphQL servers should coerce as appropriate given the ID formats they expect. When coercion is not possible they must raise a field error.","Input Coercion","When expected as an input type, any string (such as \"4\") or integer (such as 4) input value should be coerced to ID as appropriate for the ID formats a given GraphQL server expects. Any other input value, including float input values (such as 4.0), must raise a query error indicating an incorrect type.","Scalar type extensions are used to represent a scalar type which has been extended from some original scalar type. For example, this might be used by a GraphQL tool or service which adds directives to an existing scalar.","Type Validation","Scalar type extensions have the potential to be invalid if incorrectly defined.","The named type must already be defined and must be a Scalar type.","Any directives provided must not already apply to the original Scalar type.","GraphQL queries are hierarchical and composed, describing a tree of information. While Scalar types describe the leaf values of these hierarchical queries, Objects describe the intermediate levels.","GraphQL Objects represent a list of named fields, each of which yield a value of a specific type. Object values should be serialized as ordered maps, where the queried field names (or aliases) are the keys and the result of evaluating the field is the value, ordered by the order in which they appear in the query.","All fields defined within an Object type must not have a name which begins with \"__\" (two underscores), as this is used exclusively by GraphQL’s introspection system.","Where name is a field that will yield a String value, and age is a field that will yield an Int value, and picture is a field that will yield a Url value.","A query of an object value must select at least one field. This selection of fields will yield an ordered map containing exactly the subset of the object queried, which should be represented in the order in which they were queried. Only fields that are declared on the object type may validly be queried on that object.","When querying an Object, the resulting mapping of fields are conceptually ordered in the same order in which they were encountered during query execution, excluding fragments for which the type does not apply and fields or fragments that are skipped via @skip or @include directives. This ordering is correctly produced when using the CollectFields() algorithm.","Response serialization formats capable of representing ordered maps should maintain this ordering. Serialization formats which can only represent unordered maps (such as JSON) should retain this order textually.

This selection set should be executed serially.","It is expected that the top level fields in a mutation operation perform side‐effects on the underlying data system.

See the section below on Supporting Subscriptions at Scale.","As an example, consider a chat application. To subscribe to new messages posted to the chat room, the client sends a request like so:","The “new message posted to chat room” could use a “Pub‐Sub” system where the chat room ID is the “topic” and each “publish” contains the sender and text.","Event Streams","An event stream represents a sequence of discrete events over time which can be observed. As an example, a “Pub‐Sub” system may produce an event stream when “subscribing to a topic”, with an event occurring on that event stream for each “publish” to that topic. Event streams may produce an infinite sequence of events or may complete at any point. Event streams may complete in response to an error or simply because no more events will occur. An observer may at any point decide to stop observing an event stream by cancelling it, after which it must receive no more events from that event stream.","Supporting Subscriptions at Scale","Supporting subscriptions is a significant change for any GraphQL service. Query and mutation operations are stateless, allowing scaling via cloning of GraphQL server instances. Subscriptions, by contrast, are stateful and require maintaining the GraphQL document, variables, and other context over the lifetime of the subscription.","Consider the behavior of your system when state is lost due to the failure of a single machine in a service. Durability and availability may be improved by having separate dedicated services for managing subscription state and client connectivity.","Delivery Agnostic","GraphQL subscriptions do not require any specific serialization format or transport mechanism. Subscriptions specifies algorithms for the creation of a stream, the content of each payload on that stream, and the closing of that stream. There are intentionally no specifications for message acknowledgement, buffering, resend requests, or any other quality of service (QoS) details. Message serialization, transport mechanisms, and quality of service details should be chosen by the implementing service.","A Source Stream represents the sequence of events, each of which will trigger a GraphQL execution corresponding to that event. Like field value resolution, the logic to create a Source Stream is application‐specific.","Unsubscribe cancels the Response Stream when a client no longer wishes to receive payloads for a subscription. This may in turn also cancel the Source Stream. This is also a good opportunity to clean up any other resources used by the subscription.","resultMap is ordered by which fields appear first in the query. This is explained in greater detail in the Field Collection section below.","Errors and Non‐Null Fields","If during ExecuteSelectionSet() a field with a non‐null fieldType throws a field error then that error must propagate to this entire selection set, either resolving to null if allowed or further propagated to a parent field.","If this occurs, any sibling fields which have not yet executed or have not yet yielded a value may be cancelled to avoid unnecessary work.","Normally the executor can execute the entries in a grouped field set in whatever order it chooses (normally in parallel). Because the resolution of fields other than top‐level mutation fields must always be side effect‐free and idempotent, the execution order must not affect the result, and hence the server has the freedom to execute the field entries in whatever order it deems optimal.","For example, given the following grouped field set to be executed normally:","A valid GraphQL executor can resolve the four fields in whatever order it chose (however of course birthday must be resolved before month, and address before street).","When executing a mutation, the selections in the top most selection set will be executed in serial order, starting with the first appearing field textually.","When executing a grouped field set serially, the executor must consider each entry from the grouped field set in the order provided in the grouped field set. It must determine the corresponding entry in the result map for each item to completion before it continues on to the next item in the grouped field set:","For example, given the following selection set to be executed serially:","Before execution, the selection set is converted to a grouped field set by calling CollectFields(). Each entry in the grouped field set is a list of fields that share a response key (the alias if defined, otherwise the field name). This ensures all fields with the same response key included via referenced fragments are executed at the same time.","As an example, collecting the fields of this selection set would collect two instances of the field a and one of field b:","Each field requested in the grouped field set that is defined on the selected objectType will result in an entry in the response map. Field execution first coerces any provided argument values, then resolves a value for the field, and finally completes that value either by recursively executing another selection set or coercing a scalar value.","Fields may include arguments which are provided to the underlying runtime in order to correctly produce a value. These arguments are defined by the field in the type system to have a specific input type.","At each argument position in a query may be a literal Value, or a Variable to be provided at runtime.","Add an entry to coercedValues named argumentName with the value value.","Otherwise:","If value cannot be coerced according to the input coercion rules of variableType, throw a field error.","Let coercedValue be the result of coercing value according to the input coercion rules of variableType.","Add an entry to coercedValues named argumentName with the value coercedValue.","Return coercedValues.","Variable values are not coerced because they are expected to be coerced before executing the operation in CoerceVariableValues(), and valid queries must only allow usage of variables of appropriate types.","While nearly all of GraphQL execution can be described generically, ultimately the internal system exposing the GraphQL interface must provide values. This is exposed via ResolveFieldValue, which produces a value for a given field on a type for a real value.","As an example, this might accept the objectTypePerson, the field\"soulMate\", and the objectValue representing John Lennon. It would be expected to yield the value representing Yoko Ono.","Let resolver be the internal function provided by objectType for determining the resolved value of a field named fieldName.","Return the result of calling resolver, providing objectValue and argumentValues.","It is common for resolver to be asynchronous due to relying on reading an underlying database or networked service to produce a value. This necessitates the rest of a GraphQL executor to handle an asynchronous execution flow.","After resolving the value for a field, it is completed by ensuring it adheres to the expected return type. If the return type is another Object type, then the field execution process continues recursively.","Return the result of evaluating ExecuteSelectionSet(subSelectionSet, objectType, result, variableValues)normally (allowing for parallelization).","Resolving Abstract Types","When completing a field with an abstract return type, that is an Interface or Union return type, first the abstract type must be resolved to a relevant Object type. This determination is made by the internal system using whatever means appropriate.","A common method of determining the Object type for an objectValue in object‐oriented environments, such as Java or C#, is to use the class name of the objectValue.","If an error is thrown while resolving a field, it should be treated as though the field returned null, and an error must be added to the \"errors\" list in the response.","If the result of resolving a field is null (either because the function to resolve the field returned null or because an error occurred), and that field is of a Non-Null type, then a field error is thrown. The error must be added to the \"errors\" list in the response.","If the field returns null because of an error which has already been added to the \"errors\" list in the response, the \"errors\" list must not be further affected. That is, only one error should be added to the errors list per field.","Since Non-Null type fields cannot be null, field errors are propagated to be handled by the parent field. If the parent field may be null then it resolves to null, otherwise if it is a Non-Null type, the field error is further propagated to it’s parent field.","If a List type wraps a Non-Null type, and one of the elements of that list resolves to null, then the entire list must resolve to null. If the List type is also wrapped in a Non-Null, the field error continues to propagate upwards.","If all fields from the root of the request to the source of the field error return Non-Null types, then the \"data\" entry in the response should be null.","When a GraphQL server receives a request, it must return a well‐formed response. The server’s response describes the result of executing the requested operation if successful, and describes any errors encountered during the request.","A response may contain both a partial response as well as encountered errors in the case that a field error occurred on a field which was replaced with null.","If the operation encountered any errors, the response map must contain an entry with key errors. The value of this entry is described in the “Errors” section. If the operation completed without encountering any errors, this entry must not be present.","If the operation included execution, the response map must contain an entry with key data. The value of this entry is described in the “Data” section. If the operation failed before execution, due to a syntax error, missing information, or validation error, this entry must not be present.","The response map may also contain an entry with key extensions. This entry, if set, must have a map as its value. This entry is reserved for implementors to extend the protocol however they see fit, and hence there are no additional restrictions on its contents.","To ensure future changes to the protocol do not break existing servers and clients, the top level response map must not contain any entries other than the three described above.","When errors is present in the response, it may be helpful for it to appear first when serialized to make it more clear when errors are present in a response during debugging.","The data entry in the response will be the result of the execution of the requested operation. If the operation was a query, this output will be an object of the schema’s query root type; if the operation was a mutation, this output will be an object of the schema’s mutation root type.","If an error was encountered before execution begins, the data entry should not be present in the result.","If an error was encountered during the execution that prevented a valid response, the data entry in the response should be null.","The errors entry in the response is a non‐empty list of errors, where each error is a map.","If no errors were encountered during the requested operation, the errors entry should not be present in the result.","If the data entry in the response is not present, the errors entry in the response must not be empty. It must contain at least one error. The errors it contains should indicate why no data was able to be returned.","If the data entry in the response is present (including if it is the value null), the errors entry in the response may contain any errors that occurred during execution. If errors occurred during execution, it should contain those errors.","Error result format","Every error must contain an entry with the key message with a string description of the error intended for the developer as a guide to understand and correct the error.","If an error can be associated to a particular point in the requested GraphQL document, it should contain an entry with the key locations with a list of locations, where each location is a map with the keys line and column, both positive numbers starting from 1 which describe the beginning of an associated syntax element.","If an error can be associated to a particular field in the GraphQL result, it must contain an entry with the key path that details the path of the response field which experienced the error. This allows clients to identify whether a null result is intentional or caused by a runtime error.","This field should be a list of path segments starting at the root of the response and ending with the field associated with the error. Path segments that represent fields should be strings, and path segments that represent list indices should be 0‐indexed integers. If the error happens in an aliased field, the path to the error should use the aliased name, since it represents a path in the response, not in the query.","For example, if fetching one of the friends’ names fails in the following query:","Example № 185{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":6,\"column\":7}],\"path\":[\"hero\",\"heroFriends\",1,\"name\"]}],\"data\":{\"hero\":{\"name\":\"R2-D2\",\"heroFriends\":[{\"id\":\"1000\",\"name\":\"Luke Skywalker\"},{\"id\":\"1002\",\"name\":null},{\"id\":\"1003\",\"name\":\"Leia Organa\"}]}}}","If the field which experienced an error was declared as Non-Null, the null result will bubble up to the next nullable field. In that case, the path for the error should include the full path to the result field where the error occurred, even if that field is not present in the response.","For example, if the name field from above had declared a Non-Null return type in the schema, the result would look different but the error reported would be the same:","Example № 186{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":6,\"column\":7}],\"path\":[\"hero\",\"heroFriends\",1,\"name\"]}],\"data\":{\"hero\":{\"name\":\"R2-D2\",\"heroFriends\":[{\"id\":\"1000\",\"name\":\"Luke Skywalker\"},null,{\"id\":\"1003\",\"name\":\"Leia Organa\"}]}}}","GraphQL services may provide an additional entry to errors with key extensions. This entry, if set, must have a map as its value. This entry is reserved for implementors to add additional information to errors however they see fit, and there are no additional restrictions on its contents.","Example № 187{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":6,\"column\":7}],\"path\":[\"hero\",\"heroFriends\",1,\"name\"],\"extensions\":{\"code\":\"CAN_NOT_FETCH_BY_ID\",\"timestamp\":\"Fri Feb 9 14:33:09 UTC 2018\"}}]}","GraphQL services should not provide any additional entries to the error format since they could conflict with additional entries that may be added in future versions of this specification.","Previous versions of this spec did not describe the extensions entry for error formatting. While non‐specified entries are not violations, they are still discouraged.","Counter Example № 188{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":6,\"column\":7}],\"path\":[\"hero\",\"heroFriends\",1,\"name\"],\"code\":\"CAN_NOT_FETCH_BY_ID\",\"timestamp\":\"Fri Feb 9 14:33:09 UTC 2018\"}]}","GraphQL does not require a specific serialization format. However, clients should use a serialization format that supports the major primitives in the GraphQL response. In particular, the serialization format must at least support representations of the following four primitives:","Map","List","String","Null","A serialization format should also support the following primitives, each representing one of the common GraphQL scalar types, however a string or simpler primitive may be used as a substitute if any are not directly supported:","Boolean","Int","Float","Enum Value","This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of what a serialization format may encode. For example custom scalars representing a Date, Time, URI, or number with a different precision may be represented in whichever relevant format a given serialization format may support.","Since the result of evaluating a selection set is ordered, the serialized Map of results should preserve this order by writing the map entries in the same order as those fields were requested as defined by query execution. Producing a serialized response where fields are represented in the same order in which they appear in the request improves human readability during debugging and enables more efficient parsing of responses if the order of properties can be anticipated.","Serialization formats which represent an ordered map should preserve the order of requested fields as defined by CollectFields() in the Execution section. Serialization formats which only represent unordered maps but where order is still implicit in the serialization’s textual order (such as JSON) should preserve the order of requested fields textually.","For example, if the request was { name, age }, a GraphQL service responding in JSON should respond with { \"name\": \"Mark\", \"age\": 30 } and should not respond with { \"age\": 30, \"name\": \"Mark\" }.","While JSON Objects are specified as an unordered collection of key‐value pairs the pairs are represented in an ordered manner. In other words, while the JSON strings { \"name\": \"Mark\", \"age\": 30 } and { \"age\": 30, \"name\": \"Mark\" } encode the same value, they also have observably different property orderings.","This does not violate the JSON spec, as clients may still interpret objects in the response as unordered Maps and arrive at a valid value.","A context‐free grammar consists of a number of productions. Each production has an abstract symbol called a “non‐terminal” as its left‐hand side, and zero or more possible sequences of non‐terminal symbols and or terminal characters as its right‐hand side.","Starting from a single goal non‐terminal symbol, a context‐free grammar describes a language: the set of possible sequences of characters that can be described by repeatedly replacing any non‐terminal in the goal sequence with one of the sequences it is defined by, until all non‐terminal symbols have been replaced by terminal characters.","Terminals are represented in this document in a monospace font in two forms: a specific Unicode character or sequence of Unicode characters (ex. = or terminal), and a pattern of Unicode characters defined by a regular expression (ex /[0-9]+/).","Non‐terminal production rules are represented in this document using the following notation for a non‐terminal with a single definition:","The GraphQL language is defined in a syntactic grammar where terminal symbols are tokens. Tokens are defined in a lexical grammar which matches patterns of source characters. The result of parsing a sequence of source Unicode characters produces a GraphQL AST.","A Lexical grammar production describes non‐terminal “tokens” by patterns of terminal Unicode characters. No “whitespace” or other ignored characters may appear between any terminal Unicode characters in the lexical grammar production. A lexical grammar production is distinguished by a two colon :: definition.","A Syntactical grammar production describes non‐terminal “rules” by patterns of terminal Tokens. Whitespace and other ignored characters may appear before or after any terminal Token. A syntactical grammar production is distinguished by a one colon : definition.","This specification uses some additional notation to describe common patterns, such as optional or repeated patterns, or parameterized alterations of the definition of a non‐terminal. This section explains these short‐hand notations and their expanded definitions in the context‐free grammar.","Constraints","A grammar production may specify that certain expansions are not permitted by using the phrase “but not” and then indicating the expansions to be excluded.","A symbol definition subscript suffix parameter in braces “SymbolParam” is shorthand for two symbol definitions, one appended with that parameter name, the other without. The same subscript suffix on a symbol is shorthand for that variant of the definition. If the parameter starts with “?”, that form of the symbol is used if in a symbol definition with the same parameter. Some possible sequences can be included or excluded conditionally when respectively prefixed with “[+Param]” and “[~Param]”.","This specification describes some algorithms used by the static and runtime semantics, they’re defined in the form of a function‐like syntax with the algorithm’s name and the arguments it accepts along with a list of algorithmic steps to take in the order listed. Each step may establish references to other values, check various conditions, call other algorithms, and eventually return a value representing the outcome of the algorithm for the provided arguments.","For example, the following example describes an algorithm named Fibonacci which accepts a single argument number. The algoritm’s steps produce the next number in the Fibonacci sequence:"],"isopubdate":""}

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn't authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook's unusual public explanation of the move wasn't clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company. For the \"avoidance of doubt,\" the spokesman said, none of Kogan's data was used in Cambridge Analytica's 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign.","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens.

Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Welcome to Messenger Kids | WIRED","text":["Facebook for 6-Year-Olds? Welcome to Messenger Kids","Share","Facebook for 6-Year-Olds? Welcome to Messenger Kids","David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images","Facebook says it built Messenger Kids, a new version of its popular communications app with parental controls, to help safeguard pre-teens who may be using unauthorized and unsupervised social-media accounts. Critics think Facebook is targeting children as young as 6 to hook them on its services.","Facebook’s goal is to “push down the age” of when it’s acceptable for kids to be on social media, says Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood. Golin says 11-to-12-year-olds who already have a Facebook account, probably because they lied about their age, might find the animated emojis and GIFs of Messenger Kids “too babyish,” and are unlikely to convert to the new app.","Facebook launched Messenger Kids for 6-to-12-year olds in the US Monday, saying it took extraordinary care and precautions. The company said its 100-person team building apps for teens and kids consulted with parent groups, advocates, and childhood-development experts during the 18-month development process and the app reflects their concerns. Parents download Messenger Kids on their child’s account, after verifying their identity by logging into Facebook. Since kids cannot be found in search, parents must initiate and respond to friend requests.","Facebook says Messenger Kids will not display ads, nor collect data on kids for advertising purposes. Kids’ accounts will not automatically be rolled into Facebook accounts once they turn 13.","DISCUSSION","Nonetheless, advocates focused on marketing to children expressed concerns. The company will collect the content of children’s messages, photos they send, what features they use on the app, and information about the device they use. Facebook says it will use this information to improve the app and will share the information “within the family of companies that are part of Facebook,” and outside companies that provide customer support, analysis, and technical infrastructure.","“It’s all that squishy language that we normally see in privacy policies,” says Golin. “It seems to give Facebook a lot of wiggle room to share this information.” He says Facebook should be clearer about the outsiders with which it may share data.","In response to questions from WIRED, a spokesperson for Facebook said: “It’s important to remember that Messenger Kids does not have ads and we don’t use the data for advertising. This provision about sharing information with vendors from the privacy policy is for things like providing infrastructure to deliver messages.”","Kristen Strader, campaign coordinator for the nonprofit group Public Citizen, says Facebook has proven it cannot be trusted with youth data in the past, pointing to a leaked Facebook report from May that promised advertisers the ability to track teen emotions, such as insecurity, in real-time. \"Their response was just that they will not do similar experiments in the future,\" says Strader. At the time, advocacy groups asked for a copy of the report, but Facebook declined.","On Thursday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Ed Markey sent a long list of questions about the app's privacy controls to Mark Zuckerberg. \"We remain concerned about where sensitive information collected through this app could end up and for what purpose it could be used,\" they wrote in a letter to the Facebook CEO.","Recommended","Tech companies have made a much more aggressive push into targeting younger users, a strategy that began in earnest in 2015 when Google launched YouTube Kids, which includes advertising. Parents create an account for their child through Google’s Family Link, a product to help parents monitor screentime. FamilyLink is also used for parents who want to start an account for their kid on Google Home, which gets matched to their child’s voice.","“There is no way a company can really close its doors to kids anymore,” says Jeffrey Chester, executive director for the Center of Digital Democracy. “By openly commercializing young children’s digital media use, Google has lowered the bar,” he says, pointing to what toy company Mattel described as “an eight-figure deal” that it signed with YouTube in August.","Chester says services such as YouTube Kids and Messenger Kids are designed to capture the attention, and affinity, of the youngest users. “If they are weaned on Google and Facebook, you have socialized them to use your service when they become an adult,” he says. “On the one hand it’s diabolical and on the other hand it’s how corporations work.”","In past years, tech companies avoided targeting younger users because of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection ACT (COPPA), a law that requires parental permission in order to collect data on children under 13. But, “the weakness of COPPA is that you can do a lot of things if you get parental permission,” says Golin. In the past six months, new apps have launched marketed as parent helpers. “What they’re saying is this is great way for parents to have control, what they are getting is parental permission,” says Golin.","Several children-focused nonprofit groups endorsed Facebook’s approach, including ConnectSafely and Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI). Both groups have received funding from Facebook and each has at least one representative on Facebook’s 13-person advisory board for Messenger Kids. The board also includes two representatives from MediaSmarts, which is sponsored by Facebook.","A Facebook spokesperson says, “We have long-standing relationships with some of these groups and we’ve been transparent about those relationships.” The spokesperson says many backers of Facebook’s approach, including Kristelle Lavallee of the Center on Media and Child Health, and Dr. Kevin Clark of George Mason University’s Center for Digital Media Innovation and Diversity, do not receive support from Facebook.","UPDATE 3:25 PM: This story has been updated with information about the advisory board for Messenger Kids.","UPDATE 4:25 PM 12/7/2017: This story has been updated with information about Sen. Blumenthal's and Sen. Markey's letter to Mark Zuckerberg.","Related Video","Security","How to Lock Down Your Facebook Security and Privacy Settings","The only way to be truly secure on Facebook is to delete your account.

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful U.S. watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident. The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap. As a result, the new probe carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant, which is facing similar investigations in Europe.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on two panels -- the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee – already have invited Zuckerberg to testify at two upcoming hearings. But lawmakers have not indicated if they would seek to subpoena the Facebook executive if he declined to attend or sought to send another company official in his place.","The Senate Judiciary Committee panel, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman.","Controversies","Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison","Photograph: The Washington Post","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The company, and Nix, are under pressure from politicians in the US and the UK to explain how it handled the data and what role the information played in its campaigns, if any.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham criticised Cambridge Analytica for being “unco-operative” with her investigation as she confirmed that her watchdog would apply for a warrant to help her examine the firm’s activities.","Cambridge Analytica has sold itself as the ultimate hi-tech consultant, winning votes by using data to pinpoint target groups and design messages that will appeal powerfully to their interests, although it denies using Facebook information in its work.","But in the undercover investigation by Channel 4 News, in association with the Observer, executives claimed to offer a much darker range of services.","In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques.","But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients.","When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation.","“Oh, we do a lot more than that,” he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. “Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true and make sure that that’s video recorded.","“You know these sort of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption.”","Nix suggested one possible scenario, in which the managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, Mark Turnbull, would pose as a wealthy developer looking to exchange campaign finance for land. “I’m a master of disguise,” Turnbull said.","Another option, Nix suggested, would be to create a sex scandal. “Send some girls around to the candidate’s house, we have lots of history of things,” he told the reporter. “We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I’m saying.”","He said these were hypothetical scenarios, but suggested his ideas were based on precedent. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying, because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done, what has been done.”","Any work may have stayed out of the spotlight partly because Cambridge Analytica works hard to cover traces of its operations, Nix said, using a shifting network of names and front groups.","“We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” Nix told the source in a first phone call.","Cambridge Analytica sometimes contracts under a different name, so that there are no records of its involvement, Turnbull said. That does not only protect the company, but also makes its work more efficient, he is recorded saying.","“It has to happen without anyone thinking it’s propaganda, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’ the next question is: ‘Who’s put that out?’”","He added: “It may be that we have to contract under a different name ... a different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.”","In a recent project in eastern Europe, the company sent a team but “no one even knew they were there, they were just ghosted in, did the work, ghosted out”, Turnbull said.","Covers include the setting up of fake academic projects, sometimes simply going in on tourist visas, as former employees have told the Guardian they did for US elections – apparently employed in violation of Federal law.","Nix also offered details regarding the services of professional ex-spies from Britain and Israel. “We have two projects at the moment, which involve doing deep deep depth research on the opposition and providing source ... really damaging source material, that we can decide how to deploy in the course of the campaign.”","Denham told Channel 4 News that she had issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica earlier this month. They were given until 6pm on Monday to respond to it, but she said the company had been “unco-operative” with the investigation and that she would be applying to the courts on Tuesday for a warrant. “We need to get in there. We need to look at the databases. We need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica. There are a lot of conflicting stories about the data,” she said.","It accused Channel 4 of setting out to entrap staff by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. It rejected any suggestion that the company used fake news, honey traps, bribes or entrapment.","It said: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Anlytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever … Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”","Of the suggestions they used honey trap techniques, the company said: “Our executives humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to further disclose his intentions.”","In a later statement Cambridge Analytica accused Channel 4 News of attempting to entrap its executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices, which it insisted the company did not use.","Admitting he misjudged the situation, Nix said: “In playing along with this line of conversation … we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks … I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff.

If the public’s media habits during the campaign are any indicator, it is likely that Trump and Hillary Clinton voters will be learning about the inauguration from very different media outlets. According to a new Pew Research Center survey, Americans who say they voted for Trump in the general election relied heavily on Fox News as their main source of election news leading up to the 2016 election, whereas Clinton voters named an array of different sources, with no one source named by more than one-in-five of her supporters. The survey was conducted Nov. 29-Dec. 12, 2016, among 4,183 adults who are members of Pew Research Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel.","When voters were asked to write in their “main source” for election news, four-in-ten Trump voters named Fox News.1 The next most-common main source among Trump voters, CNN, was named by only 8% of his voters.","Clinton voters, however, did not coalesce around any one source. CNN was named more than any other, but at 18% had nowhere near the dominance that Fox News had among Trump voters. Instead, the choices of Clinton voters were more spread out. MSNBC, Facebook, local television news, NPR, ABC, The New York Times and CBS were all named by between 5% and 9% of her voters.","What’s more, though Fox News tops the list of sources among Trump voters, only 3% of Clinton voters named it as their main source. And while MSNBC was named by 9% of Clinton voters, only 1% of Trump’s voters relied most on that network. The New York Times and NPR were also much more commonly named by Clinton voters than Trump voters.","These findings are consistent with past research revealing that those on the right and left have significantly different media diets, with Fox News in particular standing out among conservatives.","But some sources are about equally likely to be named by voters on both sides. This included two of the broadcast news networks (NBC and CBS) and Facebook, even though the social media site is not an organization that produces its own news. Nearly one-in-ten of both Trump (7%) and Clinton (8%) voters said Facebook was where they got most of their news about the campaign – though it is likely that the specific news outlets that filled their Facebook feeds differed substantially. Overall, 8% of voters named Facebook as their main source for election news, outpaced only by Fox News (19% of voters) and CNN (13%).","The “main news sources” mentioned by at least 3% of each voting group stand out in another way: they consist entirely of longstanding national news brands – cable and broadcast TV, newspapers, radio – along with local media and Facebook. The digital news publishers that played prominent roles in the campaign did not appear to serve as main news sources for either Trump or Clinton voters. This notably includes Breitbart (named by 1% of voters), an early supporter of Trump’s campaign; BuzzFeed, which broke a number of stories over the course of the election (named by no voters in our sample); and The Huffington Post, which added an editor’s note calling Trump a “liar” to any articles about the Republican candidate during the election – though it has since stopped the practice (named by 1% of voters).","Among Democrats, those who supported Clinton in primaries had somewhat different main sources than those who backed other candidates","The study also suggests that Democrats who backed Bernie Sanders or another Democratic candidate in the primaries prioritized, to some extent, different types of news media than those who supported Clinton – even once the general election had begun. There were fewer differences between those who did and did not support Trump in the Republican primaries.","(Note: Primary support was asked about in an earlier survey, conducted April 5-May 2, 2016; general election news sources were asked about in the current survey.)","Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters who supported Clinton in the primaries named MSNBC, local TV and Fox News at higher rates (13%, 12% and 4% respectively) than Democrats who did not support Clinton. Among Democrats who did not support Clinton during the primaries, on the other hand, 4% named Reddit – an online forum with a sizable presence of Bernie Sanders supporters and which, like Facebook, does not produce news – compared with no Democratic respondents who supported Clinton in the primaries.","These differences in media use between the primary supporters of Clinton and those of other Democratic candidates are consistent with the age profiles of both groups of supporters. On average, Clinton’s primary backers were older than Democratic voters who backed Bernie Sanders, and – on the whole – older Americans are more likely than younger Americans to turn to television and print sources as their main sources of news.","Among Republicans, the same sources rose to the top for both Republican voters who had supported Trump in the primaries and those who supported a different candidate. Only one source – Breitbart – differed in its usage between the two groups, and even it was not named as a main source very frequently. The 10-year-old digital news outlet was named by 3% of Republican voters who supported Trump in the primaries, but less than 1% of those who supported someone else in the primaries.","These intra-party differences were even more pronounced when it came to the platform through which Americans got most of their general election news. Republican voters were unified in where they got most of their news about the general election; voters who had supported Trump in the primaries and those who did not used TV, print, radio and digital sources at about the same rates.","Among Democrats, however, the differences were stark. Over half of Democratic voters who had supported Clinton in the primaries (56%) got most of their general election news from television. But this falls to 37% among Democrats who had supported someone else in the primaries. Instead, these Democrats were more likely to say they got most of their general election news from either news websites or social networking sites (48%, compared with 28% of Clinton-supporting Democrats) – though again, age played some role here.","Overall, the data also show the dominance of TV as a main source for campaign news. A majority (54%) of voters said they got most of their campaign news from television. This mirrors findings from early 2016, when Americans were most likely to name cable TV as the most helpful source for learning about the election. Television is also Americans’ most common source for news more generally.","Sharp divides between Clinton, Trump voters in regular use of some news websites","While no digital-native news publisher stood out on the list of voters’ main source of news for the 2016 election, it’s clear that some did turn to these sites as part of their overall news diet.","In addition to asking respondents about their “main source” of campaign news, the survey also asked respondents to look at a list of news outlets and identify any that they used “regularly” for news about the campaign. Included on this list were six digital news websites – a mixture of aggregators and original news publishers – whose audiences are situated at different points along the ideological spectrum, according to past research.2 Across these sites – Google News, Yahoo News, The Huffington Post, Breitbart, BuzzFeed and Drudge Report – Americans indicated modest levels of use. About one-in-five voters overall regularly got election news from Google News (18%) or The Huffington Post (17%), while 12% did so from Yahoo News. Less than one-in-ten regularly used BuzzFeed (7%), Breitbart (6%) or Drudge Report (6%) for election news.","However, some of these sources were more prominent among one candidate’s supporters than the other. The Huffington Post was used regularly for election news by nearly a quarter (24%) of Clinton voters, but only about one-in-ten (9%) of Trump voters. BuzzFeed also showed higher usage among Clinton (10%) than Trump voters (4%). Conversely, both Breitbart and Drudge Report reached 11% of Trump voters but a mere 1% of Clinton supporters.","In terms of primary support, a greater divide is again evident among Democrats than Republicans. Among the six digital-native sources asked about, Republicans only differ in their reliance on Breitbart: 16% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters who supported Trump in the primaries used Breitbart regularly for campaign news, compared with 8% of Republican voters who supported someone else in the primaries. But for Democratic voters, four of the six sites were more likely to be used by voters who didn’t support Clinton in the primary than those who did: The Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Google News, and even Breitbart (though only 3% of Democrats who supported another candidate in the primaries regularly got news from this site).","This was what researchers refer to as an “open-ended” question – that is, respondents were able to type in the name of whichever outlet was their main source. They were not given a pre-determined list of sources. ↩","While each of these sites were selected for study based on their audience’s ideological composition and high web traffic, they do not constitute by any means an exhaustive list of digital news outlets, but rather offer one window into the role these kinds of outlets play in an election cycle. ↩","About Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

{"originalurl":"https://marketranger.com/facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica-the-data-analysis-firm-that-worked-on-the-trump-campaign","title":"Facebook suspends Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm that worked on the Trump campaign - MarketRanger","text":["Facebook announced late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories, and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica — which used Facebook data to target voters for President Donald Trump’s campaign in the 2016 election. In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","TechCrunch has reached out to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica with additional questions about the timing of this disclosure and the data’s relationship, if any, to the Trump campaign and will update when we hear back."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Now it turns out that much of that data was obtained fraudulently.","The firm “harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission,” according to a major New York Times investigation published Saturday, “making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.”","Cambridge Analytica, which is backed by billionaire conservative donor Robert Mercer and has former Trump strategist Steve Bannon on its board, is already under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible connections to Russian interference in the election. It’s also under investigation by the UK Parliament for potential violations of data privacy and claims it did illegal work for the pro-Brexit campaign.","Now Facebook VP and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal has accused the firm of running “a scam and a fraud,” as he described it to the New York Times.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” Grewal, a former federal judge, explained in his statement.","Moreover, when Facebook learned in 2015 that Kogan, a Russian-American academic, had broken their rules, “we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","But that certification appears to have been a lie. The Times reported Saturday: “Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.” It added that “copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control,” but the paper was able to view “a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.”","The bottom line of the Times investigation, which it conducted with The Observer of London, is chilling: The data theft “allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate” for the purposes of electing the Trump campaign, which paid the firm millions of dollars in the last several months of the 2016 campaign.","Not only was that data used for microtargeting voters, but by tracking the response to those messages in real time on social media, the firm could advise the campaign where Trump should visit and what words would resonate most with voters in the region.","In fact, Breitbart executive board chair Steve Bannon, who became CEO of the Trump campaign in mid-August 2016, told Bloomberg in late October of that year, “I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine. Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power.”","The Facebook statement and New York Times investigations add important new information in our understanding of the shady role Cambridge Analytica played in the campaign. We also know that disgraced former national security advisor Michael Flynn had been an advisor to the firm, and as the Wall Street Journal reported in October, its CEO Alexander Nix had “reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing,”","The full story of Cambridge’s role is unlikely to be known until Robert Mueller finishes his investigation.","Think Progress is a project of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie.

We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

Mr. Trump said this past week that he had made up information during a conversation with Mr. Trudeau.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York Times","WASHINGTON — When President Trump told donors at a fund-raiser this past week that he had invented a fact during a conversation with Canada’s prime minister, the surprise was not that America’s leader makes things up, but that he openly admitted it.","Or maybe admitted is the wrong word. He actually seemed to boast about it.","In the furor that followed the disclosure of his remarks, attention focused on the impact on relations with Canada and whether the president was right or wrong in his assertion about trade. But the episode goes to the heart of a more fundamental debate about Mr. Trump: When does he know the things he says are false, and when is he simply misinformed?","Mr. Trump, after all, has made so many claims that stretch the bounds of accuracy that full-time fact-checkers struggle to keep up. Most Americans long ago concluded that he is dishonest, according to polls. While most presidents lie at times, Mr. Trump’s speeches and Twitter posts are embedded with so many false, distorted, misleading or unsubstantiated claims that he has tested even the normally low standards of American politics.","“His statement this week was another reminder of how cavalier he is with the truth,” said Bill Adair, the founder of PolitiFact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, nonpartisan fact-checking website owned by the Poynter Institute. “He seems so willing to say whatever suits him at that moment regardless of whether it’s true. In all the time that I was editor of PolitiFact and in the time since when I’ve worked with fact-checkers all over the world, I’ve just never seen any political figure distort the truth so recklessly.”","Mr. Trump’s presidency has been marked from the start with false or misleading statements, such as his outlandish claims that more people came to his inauguration than any before and that at least three million unauthorized immigrants voted illegally against him, costing him the popular vote. He has gone on to assert that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, a claim that his own Justice Department refuted, and that he would not benefit from his tax-cutting plan.","The lack of fidelity to facts has real-world consequences in both foreign affairs and domestic policymaking. Foreign diplomats and lawmakers of both parties say they do not assume anything he says is necessarily true. In a White House where one aide described the existence of “alternative facts” and another acknowledged telling “white lies,” staff members scramble to defend his claims without putting their own credibility on the line. News organizations debate when to use the word “lie” because it implies intent.","Since Mr. Trump became a presidential candidate, PolitiFact has evaluated more than 500 assertions and found 69 percent of them mostly false, false or “pants on fire” false. By comparison, it judged 26 percent of the statements by Mr. Obama that it evaluated as false and the same percentage for those by Hillary Clinton.","These are not scientific measurements, of course, because the selection of statements for examination is inherently subjective and focused on those that seem questionable, rather than a gauge of all public comments. Mr. Trump’s defenders say fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact are politically biased, which Mr. Adair and his counterparts adamantly deny. But even among Republicans examined by PolitiFact, Mr. Trump is an outlier.","While PolitiFact did not exist during most of President George W. Bush’s tenure, it has found that 42 percent of statements that it examined by Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, the two previous Republican presidential nominees, were false. The party’s congressional leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, judged on far fewer statements, were both at similar levels, 43 percent and 41 percent.","The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Mr. Trump’s supporters rarely defend him as a truth teller, but argue that all presidents lie and point to false statements made by his predecessors, like Bill Clinton (Monica Lewinsky), Mr. Bush (Iraq) and Mr. Obama (health care).","Advisers say privately that Mr. Trump may not always be precise but is speaking a larger truth that many Americans understand. Flyspecking, tut-tutting critics in the news media, they say, fail to grasp the connection he has with a section of the country that feels profoundly misled by a self-serving establishment. To them, the particular facts do not matter as much as this deeper truth.","“I think presidents, all of them, actually have a habit of thinking that they’re right, whether they’re right or not,” said Patrick H. Caddell, a political consultant who shared research with Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. “He’s more guilty of that than some sort of preplanned and mendacious statements.”","But Mr. Caddell, a strategist for Jimmy Carter when he was beaten up by the media as naïve for promising never to tell a lie, said Americans see Mr. Trump in context. “In Washington, D.C., facts don’t matter; people have narratives, including the media, and they just ignore anything that doesn’t fit that,” he said. “Why should the American people punish him when they think the entire political culture” is that way?","Mr. Trump’s reported conversation with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada occurred during a St. Louis fund-raiser on Wednesday for Josh Hawley, a Republican Senate candidate in Missouri. Reporters were not permitted in the room, but an audio recording was later obtained by The Washington Post.","As Mr. Trump told the story, the Canadian leader assured him that the United States did not have a trade deficit with Canada.","“I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do,’” Mr. Trump said, according to a transcript published by The Post. “I didn’t even know. Josh, I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’”","The president also asserted that Japan bars American cars from its market through an odd test. “They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car,” he said. “And if the hood dents, then the car doesn’t qualify.”","At a briefing the next day, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, acknowledged that the bowling ball anecdote was false. “Obviously, he’s joking about this particular test,” she said, “but it illustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets.”","And even though the United States trade representative’s office says the United States had a $12.5 billion trade surplus with Canada in 2016, she asserted that Mr. Trump was actually right because he was including items not included by the government agency. “Once you include those, it shows that there actually is a deficit,” she said. She later said on Twitter that the president was referring only to trade in goods, not trade in both goods and services, the common measurement.","But the point was that Mr. Trump acknowledged to the donors that he made the claim having no idea whether it was right or wrong. And it was not even the only time that day he made false statements.","In a public conversation at a Boeing factory in St. Louis, he lauded the number of jobs created on his watch and said “nobody would have believed that could have happened.” But in fact, 2.5 million new jobs were created in his first 13 months as president, almost exactly the same as the 2.6 million created in the 13 months before he became president and Mr. Obama was in the White House.","As a businessman, Mr. Trump often fabricated or exaggerated to sell a narrative or advance his interests. In his memoir, “The Art of the Deal,” he called it “truthful hyperbole” or “innocent exaggeration.”","When trying to lure investors to a casino project, he had bulldozers dig on one side of the site and dump the dirt on the other to give the impression that the project was making progress. He would call reporters and pretend to be a publicity agent for himself named John Barron or John Miller. He claimed to earn $1 million from a speech when it was $400,000. He claimed to be worth $3.5 billion when seeking a bank loan, four times what the bank eventually found.","“He’s a salesman and that’s not about telling the truth, that’s not the DNA about being a salesman,” said Gwenda Blair, the author of “The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President,” a biography of his family. “The DNA of being a salesman is telling people what they want to hear. And he’s got it.”","Jack O’Donnell, who was president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, recalled Mr. Trump telling New Jersey authorities that he had secured bank financing for a new casino and would not use junk bonds, only to turn around and then use junk bonds.","“In my experience with him, there are times when he just compulsively lies and there are times when he strategically lies,” said Mr. O’Donnell, who wrote a scathing book about Mr. Trump. “In both regards, after he says something, I do think he believes that whatever he says becomes his reality. That’s my experience with him. It doesn’t have to be anything big but it certainly can be.”","Mr. Trump continued his practice as president. The Washington Post’s fact-checker documented 2,140 false or misleading claims in Mr. Trump’s first year in office, a rate of nearly six a day, many of them repeated even after he was corrected.","A Quinnipiac University poll in January showed that only 35 percent of Americans consider him honest, while 60 percent do not. In their first terms, more than 50 percent considered Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama honest, although those numbers fell for both by their second terms.","Republicans as well as Democrats express concern. Amanda Carpenter, a former aide to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, has a new book coming out in May called “Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us.” On the cover is an illustration of Mr. Trump with a Pinocchio nose.","Her explanation is that Mr. Trump’s supporters do not see deception, they see a commitment to winning. “Donald Trump’s lies and fabrications don’t horrify America,” says the publisher’s summary of her book. “They enthrall us.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

(FB), according to one analyst on the Street. This week, Facebook saw billions of dollars wiped from its market capitalization after news broke that political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had used the personal information of more than 50 million users without their consent to help the Trump campaign in the 2016 U.S. presidential race.","In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves suggested that Zuckerberg's woes could be good news for blockchain technology. The RBC analyst indicated that decentralized blockchain will allow users to see exactly which data are being shared and with whom, but will not be able to prevent the misuse of data.","Instead of giving photos over to Facebook, Steves stated that with blockchain, people would instead share data like photos specifically with people, maintaining the ability to track it and make sure it is not shared with someone who gets access to their information. (See also: Bitcoin Will Become World’s ‘Single Currency’: Dorsey.)","Deception and Decentralization","\"You can 100% track all this stuff,\" said the RBC analyst. \"I think that's where we're going long term.\" Steves noted that while blockchain would solve the transparency issue, allowing users to keep tabs on their data and how it gets shared, it would not solve the control issue, failing to prevent misuse in the first place.","Steves expects cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology to skyrocket to a $10 trillion industry in the next 15 years, boosted by the proliferation of decentralized computing and open source software.","Perhaps ironically, Facebook banned cryptocurrency ads on its platform to curb \"deceptive promotional practices\" in January. Facebook's CEO and founder spoke out regarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal for the first time on Wednesday, indicating that he is \"really sorry\" and that he is \"happy\" to testify in front of Congress.","The decentralized nature and anonymity offered by the cryptocurrency space also comes with risks, causing governments around the world to double down on efforts to control the high flying space.

After making Kogan and Cambridge Analytica promise to delete the data the app had gathered, Facebook received reports (from sources they would not identify) which claimed that not all the data had been deleted - which led the social media giant to delete Cambridge Analytica and parent company SCL's accounts.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.” -Facebook","Of note, Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz and Ben Carson during the 2016 election before contracting with the Trump campaign. Cruz stopped using CA after their data modeling failed to identify likely supporters.","In response to the ban, Edward Snowden fired off two tweets on Saturday criticizing Facebook, and claimed social media companies were simply \"surveillance companies\" who engaged in a \"successful deception\" by rebranding themselves.","Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims. They are accomplices. https://t.co/mRkRKxsBcw","Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as \"surveillance companies.\" Their rebranding as \"social media\" is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.","Snowden isn't the first big name to call out Silicon Valley companies over their data collection and monitoring practices, or their notorious intersection with the U.S. Government.","In his 2014 book: When Google Met WikiLeaks, Julian Assange describes Google's close relationship with the NSA and the Pentagon.","Around the same time, Google was becoming involved in a program known as the “Enduring Security Framework” (ESF), which entailed the sharing of information between Silicon Valley tech companies and Pentagon-affiliated agencies “at network speed.” Emails obtained in 2014 under Freedom of Information requests show Schmidt and his fellow Googler Sergey Brin corresponding on first-name terms with NSA chief General Keith Alexander about ESF Reportage on the emails focused on the familiarity in the correspondence: “General Keith . . . so great to see you . . . !” Schmidt wrote. But most reports overlooked a crucial detail. “Your insights as a key member of the Defense Industrial Base,” Alexander wrote to Brin, “are valuable to ensure ESF’s efforts have measurable impact.” -Julian Assange","Kim Dotcom has also opined on social media's close ties to the government, tweeting in February \"Unfortunately all big US Internet companies are in bed with the deep state. Google, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc. are all providing backdoors to your data.\"","Because YouTube belongs to Google and Google is the biggest supplier of user data to the US Govt.

Privileges!","In 2013, the Washington Post and The Guardian revealed that the NSA has backdoor access to all major Silicon Valley social media firms, including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple - all through the notorious PRISM program which began in 2007 under the Protect America Act. PRISM's existence was leaked by Edward Snowden before he entered into ongoing asylum in Moscow. Microsoft was the first company to join the PRISM program.","The NSA has the ability to pull any sort of data it likes from these companies, but it claims that it does not try to collect it all. The PRISM program goes above and beyond the existing laws that state companies must comply with government requests for data, as it gives the NSA direct access to each company's servers — essentially letting the NSA do as it pleases. -The Verge","After PRISM's existence was leaked by Snowden, the Director of National Intelligence issued a statment which stated that the only people targed by the programs are \"outside the United States,\" and that the program \"does not allow\" the targeting of citizens within US borders.","In 2006, Wiredmagazine published evidence from a retired AT&T communications technician, Mark Klein, that revealed a secret room used to \"split\" internet data at a San Francisco office as part of the NSA's bulk data collection techniques used on millions of Americans.","During the course of that work, he learned from a co-worker that similar cabins were being installed in other cities, including Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles and San Diego, he said.","The split circuits included traffic from peering links connecting to other internet backbone providers, meaning that AT&T was also diverting traffic routed from its network to or from other domestic and international providers, Klein said. -Wired"],"isopubdate":""}

Separately, the attorneys general for 37 U.S. states and territories sought details Monday on how Facebook monitored what app developers did with data collected on Facebook users and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse.","Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing.","Facebook is also facing questions about reports that it collected years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and information about text messages from Android users.

Last week, a U.K. parliamentary media committee summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about how Facebook uses data, while U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is investigating how Cambridge Analytica got the data.","In addition, the state's attorney of Cook County in Illinois has sued Facebook and Cambridge Analytica for consumer fraud after revelations that the latter obtained data on millions of Facebook users. Facebook has not commented on the lawsuit.","The recent troubles follow Facebook's most difficult year yet, as the company dealt with fake news, \"filter bubbles\" that lead to increasing polarization, and congressional hearings over Russian agents' alleged use of social media to meddle with the 2016 presidential elections.","In January, Zuckerberg set fixing Facebook as his personal challenge for 2018.

Which is why they never let Facebook enter. Instead, they let WeChat and Weibo which is like Twitter, and other social media develop in their own country from local players. As a Communist government, they have far-reaching powers over local companies and can control them like no other democratic government in the world. Aadhar in spite of being a Government initiative seems so full of holes that one can read at least one newspaper report a day that data is being compromised on Aadhar. That would never happen in China.","China's Social Credit System","Does that mean China is not interested in personal data? Not at all. In fact, their own data on their citizens is so huge that it is almost sinister. If we think that 1984 is here and we are being watched by the likes of Facebook, Google, Cambridge Analytica and the rest, the amount of data that China is churning out makes it feel like Big, Big Brother. And Big Big Brother meets Big Big Data in China, in creating a social credit system like no other in the world.","You may ask what is the aim?","The aim is to judge the trustworthiness of its 1.3 billion citizens. If Nirav Modi was a Chinese citizen, his various financial crimes would perhaps be found out much earlier than India could have. Once the social credit system is implemented in 2020, every move you make will be monitored by the Chinese government. When you leave your home, what time your reach office, what you ate during the day, how much money you spent, how many hours you spent watching video or gaming, and which bills you paid or did not pay will all show up in the government It will make all the accusations in the daily newspapers about the Modi app having a server in the US look like kindergarten stuff.","For all your sins ( not paying bills ) and all the good that you have been doing whatever that good is, you will get a citizen score. So let's say my citizen score is 880 (The Sesame credit system will work on 3 digit scores ) because I have been a great citizen. Not only that my citizen score will become publicly available. Which means that if I know that you have a score of only 451 I might not want you to be my friend. For a classless society thanks to communism, the social credit system might just create a new kind of class system, where citizens actually wear their class on their sleeve for everyone to see. Brahmins obviously will be people with a score of 900 and above. Citizens who are in debt, are not paying their taxes, or have too many traffic offenses for breaking the red light as we do in India will be severely punished. And no, it won't be easy to escape to a distant island in the West Indies. Because your airline ticket won't go through and your passport won't work at immigration.","Now that makes what Facebook, Google and Cambridge Analytica is doing seem like child's play.

Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info - now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

While the revelations are concerning, they are “not surprising,” said Chaitanya Rele, VP Marketing - ‎Havmor Ice Cream.","One of the criticisms of social media platforms is that there is minimal governance on mediums, thus creating an ecosystem that can be exploited. “There is a liability on companies when they flout privacy laws, but the same fear is just not there on digital,” pointed out Meera Iyer, Head Marketing, big basket.","Advertisers and Facebook have both profited from profiling users and building consumer cohorts that can be targeted with advertising. The more granular the data, the better it is for advertisers. Speaking about the scandal, one digital media buyer who did not wish to be named joked that marketers might be curious to know how Cambridge Analytica pulled this off because it would benefit brands.","Advertisers that benefit from the platform need to be cognisant of their role as well some felt. Karan Kumar, Head of Brand & Marketing, FabIndia, pointed out that brands should introspect on their own requirements and ask what that they put on Facebook. He said, “Let brands not forget how much they have pushed Facebook to give away any even if little data when they wanted to plan their own campaigns.”","Facebook is no stranger to controversy., but maybe it has gone too far this time. Zuckerberg has faced harsh criticism for this data breach leading to Facebook’s value dropping by a whopping $50 million last week. Even as marketers who leverage the data Facebook has on its users, people like Iyer are concerned about “what money can get you.” Iyer said that as an advertiser on Facebook, “big basket has never gotten this kind of access to information but seems like if you have money, you can buy any data you want! That’s scary.”","Ad Spends to Stay","Rele said that he has personally reached out to his connections at Facebook to understand how the platform intends to ensure users feel secure. “While we’ve received some answers I can’t say that I’m fully satisfied,” he said. He further added that “Facebook and its team are taking this expose rather seriously and I hope to see significant changes to their privacy policies in the immediate future.” Iyer said that she will discuss the issue at the next meeting with the Facebook team.","All the marketers exchange4media spoke to said that they will not be cutting ad spends on the platform yet. Last year Facebook released a statement that they had computed video views incorrectly and so charged advertisers incorrectly. “That did not deter marketers from advertising on the platform. I don’t think this new controversy will either,” said Iyer.","Kumar said as a healthy debate goes on about privacy he is sure users will continue to grow on Facebook “making it impossible for brands to ignore this platform for brand campaigns.” Even if advertisers stay away from the platform in the short term, “advertisers will not stay away from Facebook for long,” he said.","“It would be far too impulsive to pull the plug on the platform altogether, but it is something that we will continue to monitor. If we don’t see dramatic changes very soon, we’ll have to consider different mechanisms to continue reaching customers. Our ethical code is not for sale,” said Rele.","Anshuman Goenka, General Manager-Marketing, Bacardi India, felt that it is premature to consider cutting spends on the platform. “We will take a call as the situation evolves,” he said.","Finally, spends on Facebook are also a function of the users on the platform. “As an advertiser the platform is only as strong as its user base, and so long as the users feel comfortable - we will see utility in the platform,” said Rele."],"isopubdate":""}

It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

Separately, Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi reiterated Apple’s stance on the need of having strong encryption, the kind that can’t have any backdoors like the US government asks for.","Cook made his remarks at the annual China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday, Bloomberg reports, which came at the end of a rough week for Facebook.","“I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,” Cook replied when asked whether the use of data should be restricted.","“The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view it shouldn’t exist.”","“We’ve worried for a number of years that people in many countries were giving up data probably without knowing fully what they were doing and that these detailed profiles that were being built of them, that one day something would occur, and people would be incredibly offended by what had been done without them being aware of it,” Cook added. “Unfortunately that prediction has come true more than once.”","Encryption is one critical way of protecting user data. That includes encrypted services, but also encrypted devices. The US, and other governments around the world, would love Apple, Google, and others to include backdoors in their devices and services, so that law enforcement agencies could access data tied to active investigations.","Apple has always opposed adding backdoors to iOS, and nothing has changed, even though the Justice Department is looking at ways to force device makers to unlock phones part of criminal investigations.","According to The New York Times found out that the FBI and Justice Department officials have been quietly meeting with security researchers who have been working on backdoors for encrypted devices. That’s called “extraordinary access” to encrypted devices. But, whatever they call it, it’s still a feature that reduces the security of a device.","Federighi stressed the importance of strengthening security for iPhone, not weakening it.","“Proposals that involve giving the keys to customers’ device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,” the exec said in a statement. “Weakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.”","Security researchers have been considering ways that would allow law enforcement to unlock smartphones. One idea that’s gaining steam would be that encrypted devices would also hold special unlock keys that could be used to unlock a device of interest. The process would still involve a court order, and only the phone’s maker would be able to unlock it. Therefore, the keys would not be handed to law enforcement. However, this universal unlock solution would be at risk of leaking, as multiple people inside a company would have to be able to access it to help with requests from law enforcement."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

They provided an email thread to the British news organization, detailing Kosinski’s worries over the proposal.","Kosinski wrote: “In my opinion his approach is highly unethical, but I am not sure if it is worth to stir before his plans are actually materialized (e.g. he receives the contract).”","“There is a large chance that he will either correct his ways or simply fail to get it anyway,” Kosinski said.","Facebook has been reeling in the face of accusations that it didn’t do enough to prevent 50 million users’ data from being harvested without their consent—and later allegedly used to micro-target voters by the Trump campaign.","The company has apologized, recently with full-page newspaper ads in the U.S. and U.K.. It has also seen some advertisers raise concerns and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been called to testify before lawmakers in Washington, D.C., something he has said he would be open to.","Cambridge Analytica says it deleted the data as soon as it was asked to by Facebook and that it did nothing wrong.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Just 22% said a small company or startup would be responsible for such a shakeup.","\"It talks to a confidence different from the past, when the assumption was that disruption was all coming from small, nimble startups that were going to break up basic business models,\" Mark Foster, a senior vice president at IBM, told Axios. \"Now its more a case of they are fighting back.\"","The big difference is data: The prevailing wisdom is that companies like Google, Facebook and LinkedIn have vacuumed up the majority of the world's commercializable data. But, according to the study, such Big Tech companies control only about 20% of it.","Instead, far older incumbents like Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Bank of America and the UK's Santander own about 80%of the world's data, the study said.","\"Your bank has records on you going back since you started banking with them,\" Foster said. \"They know a lot more about you than Google or Linked in are going to scrape from the Web.\"","\"And they will combine their own information with external information that's on the Web, like likes and dislikes,\" he said.","A crucial fact: There is a more level tech playing field.","AI — the key enabling technology for commercializing this data — is available to everyone and monopolized by no single or group of companies. No single company is in control of AI.","Therefore, incumbent companies can build platforms customized for their own industries, and, using AI, can monetize their proprietary data, the study said.","This doesnot mean Big Tech is in trouble, the study said.","Amazon, for instance, will continue to be a threat to the industries it is preying on, \"but there will be more competition going forward,\" Foster said."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-26"}

This allowed Cambridge to exploit the private social-media activity of these users in support of the Trump campaign.","\"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of the company's leaders, according to the Times. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\"","Referring to stories by the Times and the Guardian, Alex Stamos, Facebook's head of security, wrote in a Twitter message that \"it is incorrect to call this a 'breach.'\"","\"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,\" he wrote, calling the actions \"innapropriate\" in another tweet.","U.S. Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in an emailed statement that this is \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West.\" The Virginia Democrat has been critical of the technology companies for letting their networks be exploited by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, and has called on Congress to pass the Honest Ads Act, which would regulate online election ads.","\"Left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking transparency,\" he said.","Cambridge in its statement said it had hired U.S. project Global Science Research in 2014 for a U.S. project, but that it subsequently became clear that the data from GSR wasn't obtained \"in line with Facebook's terms of service.\"","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" it said.","'Misuse' data","Facebook wrote that Aleksandr Kogan, a professor at the University of Cambridge, built an app that used Facebook's login tools to obtain information about Facebook users and their friends, which the company's policies allow.

While you may not have heard of SCL, its political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica has made headlines in the last few years due to work for the Trump campaign and the Brexit initiative. According to former US Magistrate and current Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal, this move is occurring because an app \"thisisyourdigitallife\" pulled in personal information of the 270,000 people who used it as well as information from their friends. While this is allowed under its policy, its creator -- a Cambridge psych professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan -- passed the data onto other parties including Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook's stance is that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015, which Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, said they did. The social network disagrees, and said it has been informed that not all of the data was deleted. Now it's suspending their access while it investigates.","So who are these people and what did they do with that data? Last May The Guardian reported extensively on Cambridge Analytica, citing a source who said Wylie is \"the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica.\" That same article specifically pointed out Kogan's app and its link to the company, which combined psychological profiles with specific names, phone numbers and email address plus information it bought from consumer databases. One of the claims it makes is that as much as promoting one candidate, its objective was voter disengagement and to keep potential Democratic voters home.","Facebook's VP of consumer hardware and former VP of ads, Andrew Bosworth, tweeted \"We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies. They cannot buy ads or administer its clients' pages.\" Facebook also noted that in 2014, it changed its policies around how apps can pull information from someone's friends, and now puts apps through a review process to find out if they need all the information they're requesting. But as a report by The Intercept detailing how Kogan's program worked by signing up Amazon Mechanical Turkers notes, the information had already been obtained.","As Facebook continues to investigate, there will surely be more scrutiny from all sides over how internet companies are protecting their user's information. Oh, and there's one more thing you should know -- this announcement comes the same day that a lawsuit filed by a US professor against Cambridge Analytica has been filed. Mother Jones reports that David Carroll requested a copy of the data the company has compiled on him and says that what he received is incomplete.","Update: Cambridge Analytica has responded to the suspension. It claimed it \"fully complies\" with Facebook's terms of service and that its commercial and political wings don't use or hold on to data from Facebook. CA said it had contracted Global Science Research to collect data within the UK Data Protection Act and with consent, but deleted that data when it realized that GSR had collected info against Facebook policies. None of that info was used in the Trump campaign, it said.","We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies.

The personal information of approximately 50 million people was given to (apparently not stolen by) Cambridge, a political profiling firm that used the data to create highly detailed voter profiles for the 2016 Trump campaign. The fact that the Obama campaign did essentially the same thing in 2012 hasn’t muted the outrage.","Americans appear to be grasping, belatedly, that the voluminous data they voluntarily surrender to Facebook and other tech giants can be used by people they never heard of for purposes they never consented to. Maybe this realization will lead to another: that their children, busily engaged in “personalized learning” in school, may be similarly victimized.","Facebook itself is a major player in the digital revolution of the modern classroom. Not only do many schools and districts routinely use Facebook to communicate with students and parents, but the social-media site may be embedded as a key component of personalized learning (actually depersonalized learning, as it marginalizes teachers in favor of training students by machine).","As reported by Education Week, the enormous digital push from ed-tech developers and their cronies in the federal government has resulted in an avalanche of online lessons, frequently using Facebook as the platform. Moreover, students often can log into online platforms from other developers via their Facebook accounts. This creates the link to Facebook that can then be exploited by Cambridge Analytica or other companies with their own agendas.","This is a troubling example of why Facebook (and Google and Twitter and others) offer their services for “free.” In the No Free Lunch Department, Doug Levin of EdTech Strategies, LLC warned, “Privacy experts have long been concerned about schools pushing parents onto the third-party platforms that are based on selling advertising and user data.” Facebook and ed-tech companies view your child as an economic unit, no more, no less, and whether he actually masters any academic content from using their platforms is strictly secondary to how much money they can make from exploiting his personal data.","Levin also produced a report finding that Facebook, Google, and others are embedding their ad trackers in individual school websites. Thus, as Levin told Education Week, when a student or parent logs into the website, the tracker may obtain access to “what the user is interested in, who else they know, and even where they are.” His report also found that the districts’ website privacy policies usually didn’t reveal the existence of this sort of data sharing. “It’s likely not appropriate,” he said, “for school districts to be embedding those sorts of third-party trackers on their sites.”","Ya think?","For his part, boy billionaire Mark Zuckerberg professed himself shocked — shocked! — at the “breach of trust” that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. He promised a series of steps designed to better conceal Facebook’s privacy invasions — I mean, prevent such privacy invasions in the future. But none of those steps is likely to disrupt the mining of children’s data in an educational setting, for the profit of Facebook and its corporate partners.","Facebook is too deeply enmeshed in education data-mining to turn back now. For example, the company has joined the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to develop the Summit Learning Platform for depersonalized learning. Leonie Haimson of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy has chronicled parent dissatisfaction with the Summit Public Schools, especially with respect to their online privacy policy; nevertheless, the platform is used in over 300 schools nationwide. That’s a lot of data to be profited from.","Facebook also partners with the federally created entity Digital Promise to develop a system of “micro-credentialing” for adult students (HT to Cheri Kiesecker). By training students to earn “digital badges” in various aspects of social-media marketing, Facebook can not only mine these students’ data but train a whole new set of people for effective online snooping. It’s a win-win.","As quoted in the Education Week article, John Verdi of the Future of Privacy Forum observed that “this entire [digital] ecosystem in the education space is based on trust.” Perhaps parents will now stop trusting and start demanding answers about the online platforms – not just Facebook — their children are forced to use at school. What data is being collected, who has access to it, and what are they doing with it?","If the answers aren’t satisfactory, parents should demand that their children be taught without the technology that that creates such massive threats to privacy. Perhaps a teacher and a book?","Emmett McGroarty and Jane Robbins are senior fellows at the American Principles Project.","The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of The Daily Caller."],"isopubdate":""}

The company runs a smartphone app for Android and iOS that maps discounts on the basis of user location. Users can open the app and see cash-back deals displayed on a map, similar to the way Uber and Lyft show the locations of nearby drivers.","Customers get cash back directly from GetUpside, which extracts a small fee from each deal it facilitates.","An initial test-run that was limited to D.C.-area gas stations has worked well enough that the company recently expanded its app to include grocery stores and restaurants.","“We’re seeing early signs that this could work in a big way,” said GetUpside co-founder Wayne Lin.","The brains behind GetUpside come from Google and Facebook. Lin and fellow founder Alex Kinnier are former Google employees who also worked at Opower, a local tech firm that was bought by Oracle for $532 million. GetUpside got some of its first seed capital from Formation 8, a technology investment fund founded by Gideon Yu, the former chief technology officer of Facebook. And Hal Varian, a widely published academic who is Google’s chief economist, is an investor and close adviser.","The discounts GetUpside offers can be pretty steep: up to 35 percent off for some restaurants, up to 25 cents cash back per gallon of gas for people using the app.","Such large discounts are made possible by the way GetUpside plays retailers off each other. In its gasoline app, the firm offers its services to just one station within each competitive cluster (whichever signs up with GetUpside first), shutting out its street-corner competitors.","Each consumer gets a different cash-back deal for a given location, making it impossible for that retailer’s competitors to find out the average price the retailer is getting through the app. Retailers can effectively lower their prices without their competitors finding out by exactly how much they are being undercut — effectively allowing the chosen gas stations to sidestep natural price competition, obscuring the “true price” of gas through the app.","GetUpside is far from a household name, but there are initial signs that it is gaining market traction. In late 2016, for instance, the app had only 5,000 downloads. Deals were limited to a few hundred D.C.-area gas stations, and the firm’s user base was mainly Uber drivers.","Now the app has 100,000 downloads and claims a total of 257,000 users in 10 cities. It employs about two dozen people, most of them working from home or from a WeWork co-working space in Chinatown. Lin says the business is growing quickly, although he declined to share revenue figures.","GetUpside has also been courting a different sort of investor. It recently raised $11 million from a group of investors that includes an oil company and a large financial-services firm, Lin says, declining to name them because of nondisclosure agreements.","The undisclosed petroleum company gets “some preference, but the preferences aren’t very strong” in terms of choosing which gas stations get to sign onto the app, Lin says. The gas company does not have access to GetUpside’s trove of vendor and customer data, something that could be meant to allay competitors’ concerns.","“They’re seeing an opportunity for them where we can help their stations make money at a regional and local level,” Lin said.","As the firm expands to grocery stores, it plans to apply that competitive dynamic, picking winners on individual blocks when stores compete for the same customers.","So far, the firm’s foothold in the grocery market is small. Just 15 D.C.-area grocery stores, including Harris Teeter and Streets Market & Cafe, display on the app.","GetUpside’s founders say they want to differentiate themselves from the daily-deals business by sticking to products that people absolutely need, such as food and fuel. But the difference is really in the data, they say.","Because discounts are processed by GetUpside and not the retailers, the company is able to show retailers exactly how much extra money they made through the partnership, managers say.","“Every customer gives incremental profit and we can prove that through the data that we use,” Lin said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

Last year, he told Techcrunch of plans to publish a book about the company, provisionally titled ‘Mad men to maths men’.","The managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division is Mark Turnbull, who spent 18 years at the communications firm Bell Pottinger before joining SCL.","What are Cambridge Analytica’s links with Donald Trump?","Robert Mercer, a key Trump supporter and donor, gave $15m in funding to Cambridge Analytica. Mercer, who also funded the rightwing website Breitbart, was introduced to the firm by Steve Bannon. Bannon, who was on its board from 2014 to 2016, headed the last phase of Trump’s election campaign and then served as his chief strategist.","The company worked on three candidates’ campaigns for the presidency, including Trump’s.

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board.","The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","Tony Romm contributed to this report.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Only 16 months ago, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed Facebook’s influence on the US presidential election as a “pretty crazy idea”. He has apologized several times since, but the controversy has kept growing. As The Guardian and New York Times have revealed, Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 Million Facebook users and built a system to influence the American voters. Classic investigative journalism, when Channel 4 reporters caught Cambridge Analytica’s CEO Alexander Nix on video boasting about how they influenced the US election. Nix has since been suspended pending investigation.","Facebook now suffers in four different ways: users, government, advertisers and stock. Users have responded by quitting the social media platform (ironically often announcing it on… Facebook) under the #deletefacebook flag. Calls for regulation increase, which has pressed Zuckerberg to accept the idea. UK Parliament has summoned Zuckerberg for questioning. Advertisers threaten to pull out of the platform. But maybe worst, the share value has plummeted – down almost 50 Billion dollars. Do the math: that is $1000 lost stock value for every user profile Cambridge Analytica harvested. It appears top management saw it coming: in the weeks before the leak was revealed, five Facebook bosses (Zuckerberg included) sold $1,251,992,375 worth of shares. Impressive timing!","There used to be a time when many talked about Facebook as the bringer of democracy. Now, it looks more like its undertaker. How far will Facebook fall? Has it reached rock bottom yet? Or is there more to come? One thing is clear, the catch-all phrase against all kinds of criticism “we’re just a tech company” won’t fly anymore.","Netopia’s question is: when Facebook tells us it is free and always will be – is that really so? What happens if or when Facebook starts losing money? And what happens to the data they have on us if Facebook gets desperate? This will get worse before it gets better."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

The pressure may also foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network.","U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairperson of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, for public questioning.","In a letter Monday to Sen.

Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Sunday that Zuckerberg or another senior executive should appear in front of his committee because previous witnesses have avoided difficult questions, creating “a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.” He added in an interview on British radio Monday that Zuckerberg should “stop hiding behind his Facebook page and actually come out and answer questions about his company.”","The next few weeks represent a critical time for Facebook to reassure users and regulators about its content standards and platform security, to prevent rules that could impact its main advertising business, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.","“Changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote in a note to investors.","Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to explain that the mishandling of user data was out of its hands and doesn’t constitute a “breach” — a definition that would require the company to alert users about whether their information was taken, per U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules.","Menlo Park, California-based Facebook no longer allows app developers to ask for access to data on users’ friends.

Its shares fell a further 1.8 percent.","In London, the head of Britain’s cross-party Media parliamentary committee also wrote to Zuckerberg asking for more information. “We would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March,” lawmaker Damian Collins wrote.","In Dublin, Ireland’s privacy watchdog said it was following up with Facebook to clarify its oversight. The Irish body is the lead regulator for Facebook in the European Union because the network’s European headquarters are in Dublin.","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.","According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by the-then future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon.","Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also their friends’.","Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.","Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.","Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.","Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.","GRAVE VIOLATION","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica’s London office, among other companies. It was not clear which firm they were going to.","Slideshow (9 Images)","“We are not alone in using data from social media sites to extract user information,” Cambridge Analytica said. “No Facebook data was used by our data science team in the 2016 presidential campaign.”","Denham, head of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said on Monday she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after seeing an investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 news which secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections.","She said it would not take long to obtain the warrant.","“We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection,” Cambridge Analytica said.","Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data. The auditors were in Cambridge Analytica’s offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities.","The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds ($700,000) but will gain the power to fine an organization up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","“This story comes on the back of increasing scrutiny and societal unease with FB’s potential impact on kids as well as increasing concerns around the power of mega cap Internet names, setting the stage for deeper investigation,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note, keeping his “buy” rating on Facebook stock.","Walmsley said he was worried “about how scrutiny could ultimately impact Facebook’s ability to gather and deploy data for ad targeting, which has been critical to ad efficacy and budget growth”.","The company said last month it had 1.4 billion active daily users, up 14 percent from a year earlier. But the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in its history, dipping in the company’s home market by 700,000 from a quarter earlier to 184 million.","($1 = 0.7136 pounds)","Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu in Washington; editing by David Stamp; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and David Stamp"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

It helps you track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads based on collected data, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified leads—people who have already taken some kind of action on your website.","It works by placing and triggering cookies to track users as they interact with your website and your Facebook ads.","Benefits of using a Facebook pixel","There are several ways you can use data collected from Facebook pixel tracking to refine your Facebook advertising strategy.","Track conversions","The Facebook pixel allows you to monitor how people interact with your website after viewing your Facebook ad.","You can even track customers across their devices so you know, for example, if people tend to see your ads on mobile but switch to a desktop before making a purchase—or maybe it’s the other way around. This information can help you refine your ad strategy and calculate your return on investment.","Remarket","Pixel tracking data allows you to show targeted ads to people who have already visited your site. You can choose to get really granular here—for example, you can show people an ad for the exact product that they abandoned in a shopping cart or added to a wishlist on your website.","This capability is why you should create a Facebook pixel now, even if you’re not using Facebook ads yet—so you have retargeting capabilities from your very first Facebook ad.","Create lookalike audiences","Facebook can use its targeting data to help you build a lookalike audience of people who have similar likes, interests, and demographics to people who are already interacting with your website, helping you expand your potential customer base.","Run effective ads","Using a Facebook pixel can make your ads more effective by improving the quality of the ads you run, and by improving the targeting of the people who see them.","In addition to improving your ads based on tracking their effectiveness, you can use Facebook pixel data to ensure your ads are seen by the people who are most likely to take your desired action.","How to use a Facebook pixel","You can use Facebook pixel tracking to collect data on two different kinds of events: a set of nine standard events that Facebook has predefined, or custom conversions that you set up yourself. An “event” is simply a specified action that a visitor takes on your website.","Standard events","The nine standard Facebook pixel events for which you can simply copy and paste standard Facebook event code are:","View content: Someone lands on a page on your website.","Search: Someone uses the search function to look for something on your site.","Add to cart: Someone adds a product to their shopping cart on your site.","Lead: Someone signs up for a trial or otherwise identifies themselves as a lead on your site.","Complete registration: Someone completes a registration form on your site, such as for a subscription product.","Custom conversions","You can use custom conversion events in place of standard events, or to collect more details than Facebook pixel standard events can provide.","Custom conversions use URL rules based on specific URLS or URL keywords. So, for example, you could use Facebook pixel tracking to record views of a specific category of merchandise on your website, instead of tracking views of all content using the “view content” standard event—perhaps to separate dog owners from cat owners based on which sections of your pet supply website they viewed.","Before you can use Facebook pixel custom conversions, you’ll need to help Facebook understand the details of the conversion event you want to track. To do so, head to your Facebook Ads Manager, then go to Custom Conversions and click Create Custom Conversion to define your custom conversion event using URL rules.","You can also create Facebook pixel custom events by adding more details to standard events using additional bits of code called parameters.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The move has been massively criticized since the start, pointing out Facebook's long standing tradition of privacy invasions. Even the VPN app’s description states that all browsing data is actually collected by Facebook to improve its products and services, thus making the VPN obsolete.","According to Google Play, Android version of Onavo Protect alone has already been installed between 10M and 50M times. The popularity of Onavo and of other free VPNs - such as HotSpot Shield - shows many users might not fully understand what they are getting themselves into. After VPNspecial.com started a minor investigation of Onavo VPN’s Android application, we noticed a few worrying flaws, which might prove that Facebook's free VPN is doing much more than just collecting data for Facebook and Onavo service improvement.","After VPNspecial.com started a minor investigation of Onavo VPN’s Android application, we noticed a few worrying details, which might prove that Facebook's free VPN is doing much more than just collecting data for Facebook and Onavo service improvement.","After downloading the Onavo Android application .apk file, we de-compiled it and opened it with Android Studio. Soon, we noticed that Onavo uses HotKnot, which is mostly used to exchange data by touching two compatible devices one with the other. However, by doing that, a user is also able to make a payment and that information might be tracked. HotKnot is usually used by AMR processors in Chinese and Asian markets for collecting data and using it for market research:","We reported our findings to Facebook and were told that HotKnot was not being used with Onavo VPN. After we provided sufficient proof that the files are actually there, the response was more elaborate: \"While we did not use them (the functions are empty as you can see when decompiling), they have been removed and will not be included in new versions of Protect.\"","Considering that Facebook is inaccessible in China without VPN and that the majority of Chinese citizens are using one, it does not surprise that Facebook decided to access this steadily growing market. Facebook is simply doing what it always does - collecting the maximum possible amount of data, which it can sell or use afterwards.","The use of HotKnot, in addition to the usual Facebook tracking features, would allow Facebook to know its users’ shopping habits, and by correlating the purchase information with geo-location, would be able to gather much more in-depth information, such as psychological profiles and deeply personal preferences.","While Onavo might be helpful to some Facebook users who live in countries with oppressive governments and Internet censorship, others should steer away in order to protect their privacy.","Disclaimer: VPNSpecial puts great effort into maintaining reliable and accurate data on all of the offers on our website.

{"originalurl":"http://www.disordermagazine.com/culture/editorial-culture/nine-ways-big-data-is-sucking-your-soul","title":"Disorder Magazine","text":["Nine Ways Big Data Is Sucking Your Soul","The internet promised the world. Decentralised and governed only by imagination, its virtual filigree would empower individuals and galvanise communities. Instead this vision has faded into an absurd alternative dimension, a tangled web of twisted truths, trolls and Trumps. Replacing technutopia… political players and technogarcs lurk behind convincing masks of convenience productivity and entertainment, directing our digital consumption like modern-day Pied Pipers. What’s the opposite of transparency? A computer monitor. A phone screen. A scanner darkly. Which begs one big creepy question – like, who has access to our data? – and nine terrifying conclusions. Illustrations by Benji Roebuck","1. WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN?","The internet is vast, limitless, unbound. Except the internet is just five things: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. Yep, five giant tech companies all based in the western United States govern everything you see online, the channels where you see it, and the devices you use to access it. Imagine letting five guys you’ve never met – let’s call them Sundar, Tim, Satya, Mark and Jeff – control your eyes and fingers. And there’s nothing you or your elected representative can do to stop them. With great power comes great monopoly, as Uncle Ben offa Spider-Man and not offa packets of rice, might have warned. Thus Apple reroutes overseas profits via subsidiaries in Ireland, saving more on tax in a year than the UK spends on transportation. But, hey, you really need the distraction of your iPhone while stuck for 40 minutes on a Southern train in the sidings at Heyward Heath. Basically, the internet’s five leaping lords are unbridled as pagan gods and you should picture them peeking over your shoulder during every skanky “I was just curious!” internet search and peering through your laptop camera whenever you rattle your milkshake.","2. DUMB FUCKS","Mark Zuckerberg called Facebook’s early users “dumb fucks”. Here’s why. Any information you feed the internet, as innocuous even as a Like, is stored and collated and cross-referenced with other data to generate a profile… not your profile, their profile of you, which can describe and predict your behaviour more accurately than your live-in lover, brother or mother. Many websites host trackers that spy on your movements across devices: your private looks-at-porn-then-swastikas-then-shoes activity gets fed back to site owners plus, y’know those fives guys named Sundar, Tim, Satya, Mark, Jeff and the CIA. (Oh wait…) This data, when collected in large “anonymous” sets and mushed with other users gives life to algorithms, which organise the online world you see and slyly encourage you to engage and buy stuff, to stay in the curated maze. Facebook makes 80 per cent of its revenue through targeted advertising – ten billion dollars in 2016. And that’s not just pimping things, but ideas, carefully crafted ideas, typically about Mexicans. Privacy is no longer a \"social norm”, says Mark Zuckerberg, who maintains four empty properties around his home so he can’t be spied on.","3. I AM NOT A NUMBER!","Data is not very anonymous. Combined with other publicly available info – work, hobbies, address, birthday – your online habits are easily traced back to you. Just so you know. But let’s talk about a type of algorithmic process called scoring. Social media data, such as a user’s interests, writing style and friends list are used to create talent scores for employability, health scores for deciding insurance rates, recidivism scores for calculating the probability of reoffending. Stuff you didn’t know counted for anything, counts for something. Insurance, mostly, if you live in the UK and want a cheap deal. Text speak grammar and phonetic spelling will effect your premiums in this scenario. IBM, the computing behemoth, conducted an experiment where info from Twitter and stolen passports from the dark web (the truly massive web not controlled by Sundar & pals), plus media and humanitarian casualty reports, were combined to track Syrian refugees and predict if they were a “terrorist”. In 2017 a machine-learning Facebook algorithm returned “anti-Semites” as an advertorial target audience. Check out trackography.org for an overview of the companies tracking your movements.","4. PULL FOR PLEASURE","Americans paw their smartphones more than 2,600 times per day. Because they are hopelessly addicted. And probably so are you. Tech companies stuff their products with addictive design. Psychologists help give apps more pop than a tube of Pringles: pull down to refresh, endless scrolling, autoplaying videos. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain’s reward and pleasure centres. That little buzz from seeing the red dot of a new message? That’s dopamine in action. But social media is also more sinister, exploiting negative emotions such as frustration, loneliness and boredom to trigger engagement. Do you habitually, ritually, reflexively check for new notifications? They got you, baby.","5. SMARTPHONES, DUMB HUMANS","More than two billion of us carry smartphones and thus can access to the world’s total amassed knowledge in the time it takes to say “Kardashian”. What people used to call “memory” and “imagination” is out-sourced to Google. There’s just too much, there’s way too much info. And in an effort to suck it all up, we chop it into little bites of, say, 280 characters. Awesome: a negligible amount of knowledge about many, many things, and a deep understanding of next to nothing. But something else is at play. The phone itself is a distraction, calling us to the next dopamine hit – whether it’s in your hand, in your pocket, or even switched off. According to one study, its mere presence damages your cognitive capacity. The expectation that it could blink or vibrate at any moment limits our ability to focus and somewhat lowers the old IQ, a phenomenon called “continuous partial attention”.","6. NUKE 'EM ALL","Remember when people worried that mobile phones caused cancer and killed sperms (not necessarily in that order)! That was a real dumb time, right? Not a big part of the advertising: healthy, bouncy people with great teeth in phone marketing don’t get ushered off by a hastily-delivered caveat, like for pharmaceuticals. “Prolonged smartphone use may desecrate your balls.” But, in late 2017 the California Department of Health issued some guidelines to reduce the public’s risk to radiation emitted by their smartphones. These include: keep the phone away from the body, keep the phone away from the bed at night, remove headsets when not on a call. In summary, treat your phone like it’s your ex: lock it in a lead-lined box and bury it in the cellar. I mean, stay as far away as possible.","7. FAIR AND BALANCED","Emotional contagion is a group-mind phenomenon. Remember when everyone on Oxford Street got the fear because of a bomb that turned out to be one guy getting slapped at the tube station? That. On the internet, it’s when the nonsense you post matches the tone of the guff in your feed. For a week in 2014, Cornell University filtered half a million Facebook feeds: some only saw friends’ positive posts, while others were met with an onslaught of depressing vitriol. If all we see is Hallmark greeting cards, we start posting in the style of Hallmark greeting cards, is the conclusion. Replace Hallmark with Hitler and soon Poland’s gonna want to strengthen its borders. Cambridge Analytica is a private data mining company that specialises in leveraging personal info. Their modified messages elicit the sort of emotional response that is felt at the polls. Happy clients include Leave.EU and Elect Donald Trump. This is not a problem of the weak-minded. We are all being subtly influenced, every swiping minute.","8. BRAVE NEW WEB","The internet of things turns daily life into 1960s sci-fi. Self-driving car? Check. Delivery drones? Check. Inter-connectedness homes? Check. Robot hand to ease your tension? Probably. There’s a future being cooked where a holographic salesman pops up at any shop you’ve passed twice, where virtual worlds are as addictive as cocaine and government surveillance files are more detailed than a narcissist’s diary. Nothing takes place that isn’t documented for Instagram. Nothing real, anyway. We have replaced ourselves with glossy upgrades; unreal confections who show no fear. We have sub-let reality to little boxes of light. And in this gilded sociopathic state, shock-horror, mental health issues amongst young people are soaring.","9. THE WITHDRAWAL METHOD","Google powers 97% of all mobile searches. If school taught us anything it was, get more than one point of view. And don’t take candy from strangers, which feels relevant here, too. Break free of Google and use the search engines Qwant, DuckDuckGo or Startpage, which don’t keep records. Make anonymity a habit. Search in private mode on desktop or try Firefox Focus on mobile, which is private by default. Block ads with AdBlock Plus. Deny location permissions to apps you’re not currently using. Ditch apps you don’t open: they continue to collect data on you, especially the free ones, the creeps. Use unique passwords across different accounts, and have separate emails for different purposes. Like a damn spy. Flight mode is not just for aeroplanes, it’s get-back-to-your-life mode. Creativity mode. Me mode. And if you’re feeling really brave, leave your phone behind for a day. Make it a game. Let’s pretend it’s the 1980s! As the legend Ferris Bueller said: “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”"],"isopubdate":""}

Aside from hiding from the public the fact that Cambridge Analytica took hold of a treasure trove of user data from Facebook accounts sans their permission, new scathing discoveries now show that the company was collecting other stuff as well.","Facebook has been gathering call records and SMS data from Android devices for years. Several users on Twitter noticed this after acquiring their downloadable Facebook data record. Many users have been terrified of what Facebook might have on them amid the Cambridge Analytics scandal, pushing them to download their profile data. The results? It appears Facebook has been collecting types of data that it shouldn't.","Facebook Knows About Your Texts And Phone Calls","Twitter user Mat Johnson says his Facebook history record contains \"every single phone cellphone call and text I made for about a year,\" and another Twitter user, Dylan McKay, says his file contains the full call logs between him and his partner's mother. Others are finding similar patterns, wherein only close relatives are the only people tracked.","As Ars Technica reports, installing Facebook on Android requires these permissions: access to contacts, SMS, and calls. Facebook apparently needs this information to enhance the algorithm in charge of recommending which friends to add. The company also leverages that data to better determine which from a user's contacts are friends and which are merely colleagues.","Facebook collects those data via its stand-alone messaging platform, Messenger. Some users have this app set up as their default SMS client instead of something like, say, the stock Android Messages app.","Ars Technica stresses that Facebook has been practicing this data collection for years now. Facebook has addressed this issue, but it seems to suggest that data collection is a normal aspect of apps that let a user upload contacts.","iOS users seem to be unaffected.","#DeleteFacebook","Facebook, in a blog post on March 25, laid down its data collection practices and clarified that the feature is merely optional. However, the company failed to say exactly why it was gathering data on users and what it was being used for.","Suffice it to say that Facebook is in probably the worst pickle any social media company has ever been in. There's now even a movement called #DeleteFacebook that's encouraging users to get rid of their account so as to prevent it from collecting even more data. The company recently ran full-page apology ads in several high-profile newspapers, but it's not clear whether those will assuage public unrest."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows.

Specifically, the employee in question was told he was getting a promotion and led into a room to discuss it — only to find out the entire thing was a ruse and he was very much in the hot seat.","“It’s horrifying how much they know,” he told the paper. “You go into Facebook and it has this warm, fuzzy feeling of ‘we’re changing the world’ and ‘we care about things’. But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg’s secret police.”","Some companies pay external security agents to eavesdrop in cafes near their offices to see if employees are blabbing","And Facebook will go after you even if you leak things not directly related to the product. A prominent example came in 2016 when Gizmodo reported that Mark Zuckerberg had called out employees for crossing out \"Black Lives Matter\" from a company wall meant for writing physical messages and replacing it with \"All Lives Matter.\"","“We’ve never had rules around what people can write on our walls,” wrote Zuckerberg in an internal post obtained by Gizmodo. “We expect everybody to treat each other with respect.”","You can guess what happened next. According to Wired, Zuckerberg had the person who leaked his message about respect and tolerance found and fired.","“The counterbalance to giving you this huge trusting environment is if anyone steps out of line, they’ll squash you like a bug,” The Guardian's anonymous source told the paper.","With Facebook in particular, this isn't exactly news to those in Silicon Valley.

The Guardian further reported (and you should really read the entire story) that Google employs the services of a company called Pinkerton. What does Pinkerton do? Well, they send people to physically monitor and spy on employees outside of their office — like in coffee shops — for one.","That two of the most valuable companies in the world, who just so happen to have made their vast fortunes by collecting massive amounts of personal information about their users, also take a dim view of the privacy rights of their own employees should perhaps come as no surprise. Still, it's worth keeping in mind the next time you hear about those sunny Silicon Valley campuses. Because behind all the free food and wonderful perks lurk a few paranoid and powerful kings who see it as their right to squash any employee who dares to stand in their way.","And, perhaps, that should make you consider just what exactly the Zuckerbergs and Sundar Pichais of the world think of privacy for little old you.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

But it's a good bet that initiative will be overtaken by a fresh round of West Wing chaos, speculation about personnel shake-ups and revelations about the legal duel between the President and Stormy Daniels, a porn star who claims she had an affair with Trump more than decade ago.","But, far from being put off by the turmoil rocking his administration, Trump appears to be relishing a new chapter of his presidency, as he axes and undermines aides he distrusts and gives his impulsive personality free rein.","The result is that the President is leading Washington, the nation and the world into an even more unpredictable phase, testing the limits of his political power at home and putting the international system under extreme strain.","Trump spent the weekend gloating over the firing of McCabe, who he portrayed as the epitome of corruption at the tip of the bureau, and one of those responsible for what he sees as the unjustified investigation into allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia.","But sources familiar with the matter told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that as he phoned his outside advisers and allies over the weekend, Trump's growing irritation with special counsel Robert Mueller overshadowed his delight over McCabe's late-night dismissal. He escalated his assault on Mueller over the weekend in a way that made it look like an attempt to fire the special counsel, once thought impossible owing to its constitutional implications, is very much on his mind.","\"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" Trump wrote on Twitter Saturday night. He reiterated that point Monday morning, dismissing the investigation as a \"WITCH HUNT.\"","McCabe was fired at the recommendation of an FBI internal disciplinary process into his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But suspicions he was cast out for political reasons have been stoked by Trump's incessant public campaign for his ouster.","McCabe, however, hit back at his firing and complained that he had been pushed out hours before he was due to retire because Trump wanted to slander the FBI and the Mueller probe, in which he is a key witness.","Trump's fresh attacks on Mueller immediately renewed speculation that the President would try to dismiss the special counsel, potentially by replacing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is recused from any matter relating to the 2016 elections, and replacing him with an ally willing to do his bidding.","That prospect prompted some Republicans to warn that Trump was on the threshold of dangerous territory.","\"I think that people see that as a massive red line that can't be crossed,\" Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"","\"So, I hope that that's the case. And I would just hope that enough people would prevail on the president 'now, don't go there. Don't go there.'\"","\"As I have said before, if he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we're a rule of law nation,\" Graham said.","Trump's lawyer Ty Cobb however told CNN's Gloria Borger on Sunday night that nothing had changed in the White House's attitude to the special counsel.","\"In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller,\" Cobb said.","One reason why Trump may be lashing out at Mueller is the special counsel seems to be edging closer to the President by the day. Last week, it emerged that he had subpoenaed documents from the Trump organization -- including some that related to its business dealings with Russia.","But the Russia probe is not the only source of turmoil rocking Washington.","Who is next for the chop?","Many White House and Cabinet officials return on Monday with the axe hanging over them, after Trump said last week following the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that he was finally gathering the team he wanted around him.","Among those thought to be on the way out or on borrowed time include national security adviser H.R. McMaster, White House chief of staff John Kelly, and cabinet members including Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, who are like many colleagues fighting off scandals related to lavish spending.","The extraordinary legal showdown between the President and Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with Trump long before he ran for office is certain to escalate in the days ahead -- if for no other reason than the porn star's lawyer is determined to keep her case in the news.","On Friday, attorneys defending Trump and the company of his personal legal counsel, Michael Cohen, filed to move the lawsuit to federal court and claimed she could owe in excess of $20 million for violating a nondisclosure agreement.","The world outside the United States, reeling after several weeks of mind-boggling Trump behavior that matched the disruption his supporters had in mind when they elected him, will keep a close eye on Washington this week.","There remains no clarity on the administration's strategy heading into the President's planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un which the White House has said will take place as soon as May.","The fate of the Iran deal, that Trump is threatening to scrap by May but is strongly backed by America's European allies, will be in focus when the President welcomes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House on Tuesday.","And the reverberations from Trump's demand for import tariffs on aluminum and steel are still powering a frantic effort by US allies to win opt-outs.","A White House plan to crank up the heat on China's trade practices that is in preparation behind the scenes could drive a new nail into the coffin of the World Trade Organization and spark global economic turmoil."],"isopubdate":""}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Read on for some unexpected facts about the Facebook founder.","1. He nearly worked for Microsoft.When he was a senior in high school he co-created an app called Synapse Media Player, an MP3 player that kept track of the user’s favorite songs and made playlists based on their choices, essentially an early Spotify or Pandora.","Microsoft sought to acquire the company and its founders, but instead of working for the Seattle tech giant, Zuckerberg and co-creator Adam D’Angelo -- who went on to found Quora -- got a patent for the tech and went to college instead.","2. He was inventing in middle school.When Zuckerberg was 12, he created an instant messaging program that he called ZuckNet so his dentist father could know when patients arrived.","3. He has unexpected pop culture tastes.One of his favorite books is The Aeneid, and one of his favorite TV shows is The West Wing, which was created by Aaron Sorkin, the man who also wrote the movie based on the creation of Facebook, The Social Network.","4. He’s known for being frugal.Even though today he has a beautifully appointed home that is powered by an AI butler with Morgan Freeman’s voice, in an interview with The New Yorker in 2010, he said that he found all of his apartments on Craigslist.","5. His eyesight is the reason behind Facebook’s color scheme.Facebook’s logo is blue because Zuckerberg has red-green color blindness.","6. He wasn’t always a high-level coder.He first learned to code from a C++ for Dummies book.","7. He’s multilingual.He’s always been interested in ancient languages such as Latin, and he can speak Mandarin.","8. He turned down many offers to sell Facebook.Many big name companies wanted to see if he wanted to sell -- NewsCorp, MySpace, Viacom, Yahoo, NBC, Microsoft (again) and Google all put their hats in the ring -- but Zuckerberg held firm.","9. He and his wife’s first meeting was a little inauspicious.While Zuckerberg and his wife Dr. Priscilla Chan are now parents and major philanthropists, they met for the first time in line for the bathroom at a fraternity party at Harvard.","13. He’s a fitness buff.For 2016, Zuckerberg set a goal to run 365 miles during the course of the year. He met his goal midway through the summer.","14. He looks up to Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso.He has Einstein’s quote, \"Make things as simple as possible but no simpler,” and Picasso’s insight that, \"All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once you grow up,” as his favorites on Facebook.","15. His dog is a celebrity tooBeast, Zuckerberg’s Hungarian sheepdog, has his own Facebook fan page that has more than 2 million likes. His daughter’s a fan too -- he posted that Max’s first word was dog.","16. A dozen people held him manage his Facebook page.Zuckerberg reportedly has a team of 12 people that tend to his Facebook account to monitor the comments, write his posts and take the photographs that end up on his page.","17. He’s very protective of his privacy. Zuckerberg has made some considerable and litigious moves to ensure his privacy. He bought a $100 million plot of land in Hawaii in 2014, and is recently decided not to sue the people who own pieces of the property through generational ties. He also tried to tear down four houses in and around his home in Palo Alto, Calif.","18. He's buddies with Vin Diesel. In an interview with The New York Times, the action star shared what the unlikely duo's relationship is like. \"We were hanging out up at Facebook about two years ago, and I was excited about Fast 7. He said, 'You know what movie I’d most like to see is the return of Xander Cage.' It’s at a point where if Mark and I are together and if I quote a line from a character I played and I do it slightly wrong, he’ll correct me. It’s embarrassing!\"","19. He seems taller than he really is in photos.","Turns out, Zuckerberg is only around five feet and seven or eight inches, however he seems much taller in photos. And that’s because he apparently has some positioning tricks. A 2010 New Yorker profile reads, “He’s only around five feet eight, but he seems taller, because he stands with his chest out and his back straight, as if held up by a string.”","And according to Wired writer Graham Starr (and tested by Nick Douglas at Life Hacker), Zuckerberg has some photo tricks that help him look taller. One of his biggest tricks is standing closer to the camera or holding himself higher as others lean in closer.","Any day of the week, you can catch Zuckerberg in a grey T-shirt, a hoodie, a pair of jeans and some Nike sneakers. There’s a reason he wears the same thing every day. In a 2014 Q&A, when asked about his simple wardrobe, Zuckerberg said, \"I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community.”","Turns out, Zuck’s iconic grey T-shirt, made by Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli, costs a whopping $300 to $400. However, retailer Vresh Clothing studied the color, material and length of the shirt to create an affordable replica for those who want to copy the CEO’s style.","21. He can't be blocked on Facebook.As it turns out, you can only unfollow the mind behind the platform. Apparently blocking Zuckerberg or Priscilla Chan isn’t an option for users. If you attempt to block them, an error message will appear that reads, “this profile can’t be blocked for now.” As for the reason, a Facebook spokesperson told Quartz that “people trying to block a profile or Page may see an error message if it has been blocked many times within a short period.”","22. He has a substantial budget for security.It costs millions of dollars to keep Zuckerberg safe in 2017 -- $7.3 million to be exact. The figure was in a regulatory filing Facebook submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which noted that funds for his security plan -- including trips made on a private airplane -- made up 83 percent of his compensation package in 2017. The company spent $4.9 million on Zuckerberg’s security detail in 2016.","More from Entrepreneur","Are paying too much for business insurance? Do you have critical gaps in your coverage?

The authors found no corresponding link between assaults and rallies for Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.","“It appeared to be a phenomenon that’s unique to Donald Trump’s rally,” said Christopher Morrison, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and the lead author of the study.","Video","New York Times reporters have covered Donald J. Trump's rallies for more than a year. His supporters at these events often express their views in angry and provocative ways. Here are some examples.Published OnAug. 3, 2016","It may come as little surprise that the rallies were associated with increased violence, as the often volcanic clashes between Mr. Trump’s supporters and opponents were widely covered at the time.","The supporters also often aimed offensive and violent rhetoric at Mrs. Clinton, suggesting she be killed.","To determine whether those words and news reports corresponded with an actual shift in violence, the researchers compiled a list of 31 Trump rallies and 38 Clinton rallies held in cities with assault data available online.","They compared the number of assaults reported on the day of the rally to the number reported on the corresponding day of the week, for each of the four weeks before and after the event.","On a typical day, cities saw an average of 19.4 assaults, they found. On the day of a Trump rally, that number rose to 21.7.","The pattern held even when the researchers controlled for the influence of factors like population size, data sources and the day used for the comparison.","The researchers offered two explanations for the increase in assaults. Either they were the result of clashes at or near the rallies, or they occurred elsewhere in the cities after the aggressive mood on display by Mr. Trump, his supporters or his opponents had spread through “social contagion.”","There were some limitations to the findings, the authors noted. They may not apply to the rallies or cities that weren’t studied, and a greater police presence during the rallies may have made it more likely for an assault to be reported.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Violence Increased When Cities Hosted Trump Rallies.

It's right. What really happened is much worse.","On Saturday, an investigation by The New York Times, the Guardian, and its sister publication The Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that helped the Donald Trump presidential campaign had harvested the Facebook data of more than 50 million people in an effort to profile users and eventually target them with political ads.","In 2014, a researcher collected the data through an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. Around 270,000 people agreed to have their data collected through the test, which its creator, Aleksandr Kogan, defined as “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.” But thanks to Facebook’s terms of service and its API at the time, the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the researcher, who later handed the data to Cambridge Analytica, the raw information of more than 50 million people, according to the reports, which were largely based on the account of a former Cambridge Analytica data scientist.","The Observer called it one of Facebook’s “biggest ever data breaches.” The Times only referred to the incident as a “breach” once, using the term “leak” throughout the rest of the article. We at Motherboard believe the use of the expression “data breach” in this case is incorrect and may be confusing to readers.","As the news spread and echoed online, several websites and other publications called it a data breach. Manysecurityexperts and researchers—and Facebook itself—believe this is the wrong expression to refer to what happened here.","“It is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a deleted tweet.","Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false,” because the researcher who made the app obtained the data from “users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.”","Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzo@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzo@motherboard.tv","Saying that “everyone involved” consented seems misleading, given that only around 270,000 out of the 50 million people who got their data harvested reportedly signed up for the app. The others probably had no idea this app even existed. And since Facebook changes its privacy settings so frequently, we also don't know if the people who agreed to use the app fully understood what kind of data they were giving up. And no one at the time knew the data would later be handed out to a shadowy data analytics firm hired by the Trump campaign.","While we understand why some are describing the data Kogan handed to Cambridge Analytica as a breach, based on what’s been reported so far, we believe that describing this incident as a breach would, at least at the moment, mislead our readers.","We’ve been regularly covering data breaches for years. No one hacked into Facebook’s servers exploiting a bug, like hackers did when they stole the personal data of more than 140 million people from Equifax. No one tricked Facebook users into giving away their passwords and then stole their data, like Russian hackers did when they broke into the email accounts of John Podesta and others through phishing emails.","In 2014, when Kogan collected the data of 50 million people, he was playing by the rules. At the time, Facebook allowed third party apps to collect not only the data of the people who consented to giving it up, but also their friends’ data. The company later shut down this functionality.","Facebook says the data was misused because Kogan told Facebook he would use it only for academic research. But that might be the only anomalous thing about this case.","Facebook obviously doesn't want the public to think it suffered a massive security breach, like Yahoo did in 2013 and 2014. We agree not because we want to minimize the significance of the Cambridge Analytica story, but because the real story is far more troubling: This data collection was par for the course. In other words, it was a feature, not a bug. And while the process that Kogan exploited is no longer allowed, Facebook still collects—and then sells—massive amounts of data on its users.","As Zeynep Tufekci, the author of Twitter And Tear Gas, put it, Facebook’s vehement defense that this was not a data breach is itself actually a damning statement of what’s wrong with Facebook, and Silicon Valley’s ad industry in general.","“If your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used & misused,” Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote on Twitter. “There is no informed consent because it's not possible to reasonably inform or consent.”","Facebook’s security team, Tufekci concluded, can’t mitigate the company’s business model, which is predicated on collecting as much of our data, and our friend’s data, as possible.","We can condemn the misuse of this data, and Facebook’s data collection practices, without calling it a data breach, a term that may confuse readers and distract them from what we believe is the real problem here: Silicon Valley giants have built massive data collection machines with almost no guardrails on how they are used."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds | News | The Guardian","text":["The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook.","Facebook’s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company’s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.","The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analyticato determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.","The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.","The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.","On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.","“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.","The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.","Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.","Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.","Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.","Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”","The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.","“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”","Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The data, which was stored in a publicly accessible cloud server owned by Republican data firm Deep Root Analytics, included 1.1 terabytes of entirely unsecured personal information compiled by DRA and at least two other Republican contractors, TargetPoint Consulting, Inc. and Data Trust. In total, the personal information of potentially near all of America’s 200 million registered voters was exposed, including names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, and voter registration details, as well as data described as “modeled” voter ethnicities and religions.","This disclosure dwarfs previous breaches of electoral data in Mexico (also discovered by Vickery) and the Philippines by well over 100 million more affected individuals, exposing the personal information of over sixty-one percent of the entire US population.","The data exposure provides insight into the inner workings of the Republican National Committee’s $100 million data operation for the 2016 presidential election, an undertaking of monumental scope and painstaking detail launched in the wake of Mitt Romney’s loss in 2012. Deep Root Analytics, TargetPoint, and Data Trust—all Republican data firms—were among the RNC-hired outfits working as the core of the Trump campaign’s 2016 general election data team, relied upon in the GOP effort to influence potential voters and accurately predict their behavior. The RNC data repository would ultimately acquire roughly 9.5 billion data points regarding three out of every five Americans, scoring 198 million potential US voters on their likely political preferences using advanced algorithmic modeling across forty-eight different categories.","Spreadsheets containing this accumulated data—last updated around the January 2017 presidential inauguration—constitute a treasure trove of political data and modeled preferences used by the Trump campaign. This data was also exposed in the misconfigured database and had been for an unknown period of time.","UpGuard’s discovery — of perhaps the largest known exposure of voter information in history—is corroborated by technical evidence, as well as by the public statements of the responsible firms and political staffers.","The Discovery","In the early evening of June 12th, UpGuard Cyber Risk Analyst Chris Vickery discovered an open cloud repository while searching for misconfigured data sources on behalf of the Cyber Risk Team, a research unit of UpGuard devoted to finding, securing, and raising public awareness of such exposures. The data repository, an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket, lacked any protection against access. As such, anyone with an internet connection could have accessed the Republican data operation used to power Donald Trump’s presidential victory, simply by navigating to a six-character Amazon subdomain: “dra-dw”.","Upon inspection of the contents, “dra-dw” is shown to stand for “Deep Root Analytics Data Warehouse.” The concept of a “data warehouse” is common in modern business— essentially, it is a massive collection of data prepared specifically for complex analysis. Deep Root Analytics confirmed they owned and operated the dra-dw bucket, which was subsequently secured against public access the night of June 14th, shortly after Vickery notified federal authorities.","In total, 1.1 terabytes of data in the warehouse—an amount roughly equivalent to 500 hours worth of video—was fully downloadable. Among these files were clear indications of the repository’s political importance, with file directories named for a number of high-powered and influential Republican political organizations. As such, the exposed Deep Root Analytics warehouse contained a remarkable amount of fully accessible data.","Yet this was not all. An additional 24 terabytes of data was stored in the warehouse, but had been configured to prevent public access. Ultimately, the amount of data stored in the misconfigured database was equivalent in size to about 10 billion pages of text.","It would ultimately take days, from June 12th to June 14th, for Vickery to download 1.1 TB of publicly accessible files, which included two critical directories titled “data_trust” and “target_point.”","The Operation","Deep Root Analytics, the Republican data firm which created and maintained the exposed data warehouse, was co-founded in 2013 by Alex Lundry, a Republican campaign data scientist who had served as data director in Mitt Romney’s unsuccessful 2012 presidential campaign. The company bills itself as “the most experienced group of targeters in Republican politics,” offering media analytics services to corporations, lobbying groups, and GOP political campaigns seeking to reach specific target demographics. Deep Root claims to be able to more effectively reach these desired demographics by “microtargeting” using big data analytics, allowing clients to make better-informed decisions when purchasing advertising.","In order to win the election, the RNC would need to draw heavily upon the resources of several private firms specializing in data analytics. Among these private consultancies was Data Trust, a Washington-based firm that claims to “continually develop a Republican and conservative data ecosystem through voter file collection, development, and enhancement.”","Data Trust, “the GOP’s exclusive data provider,” was created by the RNC in 2011, per National Review, “to shoulder the cost of building and managing the GOP’s voter file”—its repository of detailed voter information crucial to any successful electoral advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts. As reported by Slate, Data Trust operates as a private-sector satellite of the RNC—“a hybrid, a private company that party bosses built but can’t formally run.”","Within the Deep Root Analytics database, the folder “data_trust” appears to contain nothing less than the full fruits of this RNC/Data Trust effort to house as comprehensive and detailed a repository of potential 2016 voter information.","Within “data_trust” are two massive stores of personal information collectively representing up to 198 million potential voters. Consisting primarily of two file repositories, a 256 GB folder for the 2008 presidential election and a 233 GB folder for 2012, each containing fifty-one files - one for every state, as well as the District of Columbia. Each file, formatted as a comma separated value (.csv), lists an internal, 32-character alphanumeric “RNC ID”—such as, for example, 530C2598-6EF4-4A56-9A7X-2FCA466FX2E2—used to uniquely identify every potential voter in the database. These RNC IDS uniquely link disparate data sets together, combining dozens of sensitive and personally identifying data points, making it possible to piece together a striking amount of detail on individual Americans specified by name.","Both Vickery and this reporter looked themselves up in these spreadsheets, confirming that the files contained accurate and sensitive personal information. Listed here are the .csv categories:","Starting with the potential voter’s first and last names—limiting even the barest possibility of the data sets masking the identities of those described—the files go on to list a great deal more data, including the voter’s date of birth, home and mailing addresses, phone number, registered party, self-reported racial demographic, voter registration status, and even whether they are on the federal “Do Not Call” list. Also included as data fields are the “modeled ethnicity” and “modeled religion” of the potential voter—particularly sensitive personal details that have historically been a source of controversy for data collection.","While not every field is populated for each individual, if the answer is known, it appears to have been included. A smaller folder for the 2016 election was also included in the database, but unlike the 2008 and 2012 folders, only included .csv files for Ohio and Florida - arguably the two most crucial battleground states. The entire “data_trust” folder, it bears repeating, was entirely downloadable by any individual accessing the URL of the database.","This exposure of the personal information of millions of Americans was not, perhaps, the most damaging pool of data exposed. To understand its significance, additional context is necessary.","“In this case, the people doing most of the data modeling and voter scoring – especially for field operations, voter contact and television advertising -- were from a collective of three data firms hired by the RNC: TargetPoint Consulting, Causeway Solutions, and Deep Root Analytics, which officially worked with the RNC through a new subsidiary called Needle Drop.”","Between January 2015 and November 2016, the RNC paid TargetPoint $4.2 million for data services, and gave Causeway around $500,000 in that time, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Deep Root, acting as Needle Drop, was paid $983,000 by the RNC.","Needle Drop principal TargetPoint Consulting—where Deep Root Analytics founder Alex Lundry was employed as “Chief Data Scientist” from 2005 to 2015—is referenced in the database with a folder titled “target_point.” TargetPoint, a GOP-aligned, Alexandria, Virginia-based “full service market research and knowledge management firm,” specializes in microtargeting key demographics on behalf of corporate and political clients—a tactic they claim to have pioneered “after President George W. Bush deployed our services for his successful 2004 campaign.”","TargetPoint is a trusted and well-established authority on data operations within conservative political circles, having worked in the past on Rudy Giuliani’s 2008 presidential bid, the 2008 McCain/Palin campaign, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s reelection efforts. TargetPoint founder Alexander Gage, a former polling and market researcher, explained to the Washington Post in 2007 his philosophy of data analytics while serving as presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s Director of Strategy:","“‘Microtargeting is trying to unravel your political DNA,’ [Gage] said. ‘The more information I have about you, the better.’ The more information [Gage] has, the better he can group people into \"target clusters\" with names such as ‘Flag and Family Republicans’ or ‘Tax and Terrorism Moderates.’ Once a person is defined, finding the right message from the campaign becomes fairly simple.”","While it may be better for data firms like TargetPoint to stockpile your most sensitive personal information, for the 198 million Americans whose sensitive identifying details and potential political inclinations were compiled on a public-facing cloud server lacking any security barriers, the view may be different.","The contents of the “target_point” folder were even more intrusive than those of the Data Trust repository, if less obviously intimidating at first glance: fourteen files saved in the Alteryx Database format (.yxdb), a file format designed specifically for large-scale data analysis. Most of the files were last updated in mid to late-January 2017, with several labeled as “Contact File,” with different dates signifying when they were updated.","Contained within these “Contact File” spreadsheets are the aforementioned 32-character alphanumeric RNC IDs for 198 million potential American voters, as well as the corresponding names and addresses of the voters. The clear linkage between every RNC ID and the name and identifying personal details of all 198 million people ensures all data using the RNC ID as an identifier can be tied back to the person’s real name.","The remaining files provide a rare glimpse into a systematic large-scale analytics operation being performed using a massive repository of 198 million potential voters, combining personal details, backgrounds, and political behavior to, paraphrasing Gage, “unravel their political DNA”. The result is a database of grand scope and scale, collecting the modeled personal and political preferences of most of the country—adding up to an unsecured political treasure trove of data which was free to download online.","The file dates and names indicate the other files largely concern post-election data analytics conducted in the run-up to and around Trump’s inauguration on January 20th, 2017. Some of the files align with public statements by RNC and TargetPoint officials about the kind of targeted analysis performed over the course of the campaign. A file titled “DRA Post Elect 2016 Reluctant DJT scores 1-6-17.yxdb,” for example, contains 69 million rows, and is illustrative of the kind of post-election analysis in the repository executed by the GOP data team. The likelihood of this analysis as a product of the RNC data team is corroborated by public disclosures in the press of similar microtargeting, such as TargetPoint’s analysis of \"’DJT Underperform’ voters, or Republicans still unconvinced about supporting Mr. Trump.”","In the 50 GB file titled “DRA Post Elect 2016 All Scores 1-12-17.yxdb,” each potential voter is scored with a decimal fraction between zero and one across forty-six columns. Each of the fields under each of the forty-six columns signifies the potential voter’s modeled likelihood of supporting the policy, political candidate, or belief listed at the top of the column, with zero indicating very unlikely, and one indicating very likely.","Calculated for 198 million potential voters, this adds up to a spreadsheet of 9.5 billion modeled probabilities, for questions ranging from how likely it is the individual voted for Obama in 2012, to whether they agree with the Trump foreign policy of “America First,” to how likely they are to be concerned with auto manufacturing as an issue, among others.","The spreadsheet is an impressive deployment of analytical might. However, while each potential voter is signified by their 32-character RNC internal ID, it is a one-step process to determine the real name associated with the modeled policy preferences, as the aforementioned “Contact File” also exposed in the database links the RNC ID to the potential voter’s actual identity.","This reporter was able, after determining his RNC ID, to view his modeled policy preferences and political actions as calculated by TargetPoint. It is a testament both to their talents, and to the real danger of this exposure, that the results were astoundingly accurate.","The Significance","This exposure raises significant questions about the privacy and security Americans can expect for their most privileged information. It also comes at a time when the integrity of the US electoral process has been tested by a series of cyber assaults against state voter databases, sparking concern that cyber risk could increasingly pose a threat to our most important democratic and governmental institutions.","That such an enormous national database could be created and hosted online, missing even the simplest of protections against the data being publicly accessible, is troubling. The ability to collect such information and store it insecurely further calls into question the responsibilities owed by private corporations and political campaigns to those citizens targeted by increasingly high-powered data analytics operations.","What is beyond debate in 2017 is the increasing inability to trust in the integrity of information technology systems, particularly at scale. As reliance on technology increases, so too grows the cyber risk surface; as more and more functions of life migrate onto digital platforms, more and more functions of life invite cyber risk. Beyond the almost limitless criminal applications of the exposed data for purposes of identity theft, fraud, and resale on the black market, the heft of the data and analytical power of the modeling could be applied to even more ambitious efforts - corporate marketing, spam, advanced political targeting. Any of these potential misuses of private information can be prevented, provided stakeholders obey a few simple precepts in collecting and storing data.","The fundamental problems which exposed this data are not rare, uncommon, or consigned to one side of the partisan divide; indeed, while those responsible for this exposure are of one party, the 198 million Americans affected span the entire political spectrum, their information revealed regardless of their political beliefs. The same factors that have resulted in thousands of previous data breaches—forgotten databases, third-party vendor risks, inappropriate permissions—combined with the RNC campaign operation to create a nearly unprecedented data breach.","Despite the breadth of this breach, it will doubtlessly be topped in the future—to a likely far more damaging effect—if the ethos of cyber resilience across all platforms does not become the common language of all internet-facing systems."],"isopubdate":""}

Cambridge Analytica, the data firm he worked with – which funded the project to turn tens of millions of Facebook profiles into a unique political weapon – also attracted interest from a key Russian firm with links to the Kremlin.","Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed “micro-targeting” individuals on social media during elections.","The revelations come at a time of intense US scrutiny of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, with 13 Russians criminally charged last month with interfering to help Donald Trump.","In Britain, concerns about Russian propaganda have been mounting, with the prime minister, Theresa May, recently attacking Russia for spreading fake news, accusing Moscow of attempts to “weaponise information” and influence polls.","Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, discussed with Cambridge Analytica the data company’s powerful social media marketing system, which was already being deployed for Republican Ted Cruz in the US presidential primaries and was later used to back Brexit and Trump.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, emailed colleagues after initial contacts to say that Lukoil wanted a clearer explanation of “how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business”.","“They understand behavioural micro-targeting in the context of elections (as per your excellent document/white paper) but they are failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers,” he wrote in an email seen by the Observer.","A slide presentation prepared for the Lukoil pitch focuses first on election disruption strategies used by Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, in Nigeria. They are presented under the heading “Election: Inoculation”, a military term used in “psychological operations” and disinformation campaigns. Other SCL documents show that the material shared with Lukoil included posters and videos apparently aimed at alarming or demoralising voters, including warnings of violence and fraud.","Discussion of services offered by Cambridge Analytica was apparently going right to the top of Lukoil, even though its retail operations in America are a very minor corner of the oil and gas giant’s empire. Asking for a detailed presentation of Cambridge Analyticas’s work in July 2014, Nix told his colleague the document would be “shared with the CEO of the business”.","The chief executive of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, is a former Soviet oil minister who has said the strategic aims of Lukoil are closely aligned with those of Russia. “I have only one task connected with politics, to help the country and the company. I’m not close to Mr Putin, but I treat him with great respect,” he told the New York Times.","Cambridge Analytica said an affiliate company had talked to Lukoil Turkey about a loyalty card scheme and proposed a pilot study with a small number of petrol stations there, but the project had not gone ahead. “[The talks] were about potential commercial work in Turkey and did not involve any discussion of political work,” a spokesman said. “Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate companies have not worked in Russia and have not worked for a Russian company or organisation.”","Last month Nix told MPs: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do no have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","That appears to contradict the company documents seen by the Observer, that list Russia as one of the countries where Cambridge Analytica and affiliate companies have clients.","Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who has come forward to talk to the Observer, said it was never entirely clear what the Russian firm hoped to get from the operation.","“Alexander Nix’s presentation didn’t make any sense to me,” said Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica soon after the initial meetings. “If this was a commercial deal, why were they so interested in our political targeting?”","Lukoil did not respond to requests for comments.","Kogan, a lecturer who worked with Cambridge Analytica on building up the database of US voters then at the heart of the company’s plans, said he had not had any connection to the Lukoil pitch.","But while he was helping turn Facebook profiles into a political tool he was also an associate professor at St Petersburg State University, taking Russian government grants to fund other research into social media. “Stress, health, and psychological wellbeing in social networks: cross-cultural investigation” was the title of one piece of research. Online posts showed Kogan lecturing in Russian. One talk was called: “New methods of communication as an effective political instrument”.","Cambridge University said academics are allowed to take on outside work but are expected to inform their head of institution, a rule Kogan had complied with. “We understand that Dr Kogan informed his head of department of discussions with St Petersburg University regarding a collaboration; it was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity,” a spokesman said.","Apart from that, Kogan appears to have largely kept the work private. Colleagues said they had not heard about the post in St Petersburg. “I am very surprised by that. No one knew,” one academic who asked not to be named told the Observer. Russia is not mentioned in a 10-page CV Kogan posted on a university website in 2015. The CV lists undergraduate prizes and grants of a few thousand dollars and links to dozens of media interviews.","One Cambridge Analytica employee mentioned Kogan’s Russian work in an email to Nix in March 2014 discussing a pitch to a Caribbean nation for a security contract, including “criminal psychographic profiling via intercepts”.","“We may want to either loop in or find out a bit more about the interesting work Alex Kogan has been doing for the Russians and see how/if it applies,” the colleague wrote.","Kogan told the Observer: “Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way. No data or models.” His recollection was that the Russia project had started a year after his collaboration with Cambridge Analytica ended.","He said the St Petersburg position emerged by chance on a social visit. A native Russian speaker, Kogan was born in Moldova and brought up in Moscow until he was seven, when his family emigrated to the US, where he later obtained citizenship.","However, he stayed in touch with family friends in Russia and visited regularly.

Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.

Britain’s information commissioner announced on Monday that she is seeking a warrant to search the company’s office and servers for any evidence of illegal activity.","It’s been an eventful few days for the data firm. The drama all began over the weekend with an internal whistleblower coming forward to say that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the personal data on 50 million Facebook users through a method that violated Facebook’s terms of service. Then, on Monday, the UK’s Channel 4 ran the second part of an ongoing investigation into Cambridge Analytica’s shady political practices.","Advertisement","The segment from Channel 4 featured undercover video of a man identified as Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, speaking with reporters he believed to be potential clients. From Channel 4:","In one exchange, when asked about digging up material on political opponents, Mr Nix said they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house”, adding that Ukrainian girls “are very beautiful, I find that works very well”.","In another he said: “We’ll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance, we’ll have the whole thing recorded, we’ll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the Internet.”","Offering bribes to public officials is an offence under both the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Cambridge Analytica operates in the UK and is registered in the United States.","Advertisement","After the segment aired, Britain’s Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, appeared for an interview with Channel 4's Jon Snow. Denham said that her office “has been carrying out an investigation into data analytics and political profiling and micro-targeting for several months now. And we have heard similar allegations during our investigation.”","The commissioner emphasized that Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are only one part of their investigation, which involves 30 organizations and was started with the intent of explaining to the public what happens to their personal data during political campaigning. Denham said that she issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica on March 7th and that she was not satisfied with its response. She said that her office will formally request the warrant tomorrow, and she is seeking access to the computers and property of the firm.","Facebook’s own forensic investigators will soon begin an independent review of Cambridge Analytica’s systems, according to an announcement today. Denham said that “Facebook has been cooperative with us and has provided a great deal of information about the 50 million profiles. We’re waiting on more information, but it’s Cambridge Analytica that has been uncooperative with our investigation.”","Advertisement","We’ve reached out to Cambridge Analytica for comment but did not receive an immediate reply. Considering how much emphasis the man identified as Nix in the video puts on client privacy, we’re going to go out on a limb and guess that the company isn’t very pleased.","The Washington Post reported on Monday that “Cambridge Analytica earned more than $16 million from 2014 to 2016 from nearly 20 Republican candidates and political committees.” The campaign to elect Donald Trump for president accounted for $5.9 million of that in 2016, according to FEC filings.","Update 6:50pm: Facebook has confirmed that auditors from Stroz Friedberg, the digital forensics firm it hired to conduct the probe of Cambridge Analytica’s servers, were asked to leave by UK authorities. “At the request of the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Stroz Friedberg auditors stood down,” Facebook said in a statement."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

Mercer has funded a wide range of conservative campaigns and causes, including Breitbart. Through the Mercer Family Foundation, he has funded a wide network of climate denialist groups including the Heartland Institute, the Manhattan Institute, the Media Research Center, and the Oregon Institute for Science and Medicine.","But several key directors at Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL Group, also have close ties to the fossil fuel industry, according to business records filed with the British government, fossil fuel company presentations obtained by Motherboard, and employee LinkedIn pages.","The connections show that, yet again, there is often crossover between fossil fuel interests and politically focused firms. SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment for this article.","Big Coal","Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of British company SCL Group, a former UK Ministry of Defence contractor which retains close ties to the British Foreign Office (FCO) and other elements of the UK political and financial establishment. SCL Group set up a subsidiary called SCL Elections in 2012 which, in turn, set up Cambridge Analytica as an incorporated venture with Mercer.","Media coverage to date has understandably focused on the persona of Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who is a director of the firm’s UK alter-ego, SCL Elections.","British company records, however, show that SCL Elections had another director, Christian Patrick Teroerde, who joined the company just months after it was incorporated. Teroerde went on to hold a one-year director role at SCL Elections from February 2013 to 2014.","Teroerde’s position coincided with a simultaneous role he held at another company, Hanson Asset Management, where he has been co-founding managing director since 2010.","One of the major contributors to Lord Hanson’s wealth was the burgeoning American coal industry.","Among Hanson’s major acquisitions, for instance, was the Peabody Holding Company, the largest coal producer in the United States in the 1990s. The firm was sold and grew into Peabody Energy—now the largest private-sector coal company in the world.","In April 2016, Peabody filed for bankruptcy due to plummeting coal prices. Trump’s election victory, which Cambridge Analytica helped target ads for, turned Peabody’s imminent collapse around. One day after Trump’s win, Peabody shares surged by over 50 percent, and six months later the global coal giant came out of bankruptcy.","Cambridge Analytica’s connection to Hanson’s wealth appears to have been close during that founding year. The company correspondence address for Teroerde’s directorship at SCL Elections was the same address as Hanson Asset Management, meaning he essentially fulfilled his duties to the company from the Hanson office.","Big Oil","Cambridge Analytica has other ties to fossil fuel interests. Julian Wheatland has been chairman of Cambridge Analytica parent company SCL group since 2009. During this period, Wheatland has simultaneously held a number of other directorships in companies with overlapping energy and military interests.","One such company is Phi Energy Group, a short-lived oil venture where Wheatland was a director from 2014 to 2016. According to an internal company presentation deck, Phi Energy’s focus was “exploring opportunities” in Libya, the US, Africa and Eastern Europe.","Image: a Phi Energy presentation","Wheatland is listed in the document as Phi Energy Group’s Chief Finance Officer; he also lists that position on his LinkedIn page. The document identifies the companies that Phi Energy worked with: Shell, Noble Group, Eni, Esso, BP, Statoil, Tamoil, Total and Saras—a veritable who’s who of international oil majors.","Since 2009, Wheatland has also been Chief Executive of Hatton International, a company about which almost no public information can be found. The Phi Energy document shows, however, that Hatton also overlapped with fossil fuel interests.","Image: Phi Energy presentation","Phi Energy’s presentation deck lists its then-Chief Commercial Officer as Tarick Kreimeia, who is described as “a Director of Hatton International” working under Wheatland.","According to Kreimeia’s LinkedIn profile, he was a “non-executive director” of Hatton International from 2012 to 2016. That profile not only refers to Hatton’s work “with defence and aerospace companies”, but further describes how Hatton “supports client companies, particularly in the energy industry, to develop financing strategies that will deliver the strategic objectives and help bring new products and propositions to market.”","The regions where Phi Energy/Hatton’s energy work was carried out include Iraq and Libya, both subjected to US-UK military interventions.","Kreimeia’s Phi Energy bio, for instance, depicts him as a key player in negotiating refining agreements in key Middle East countries, specifically assisting major EU refineries in negotiations with the Libyan National Oil Company (LNOC), the Iraqi State Oil Marketing Company and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG).","Climate denialism","An investigation by DeSmogUK reveals that Cambridge Analytica is also embedded in a web of power denying climate change. Besides the Mercer funding, Cambridge Analytica has numerous ties to Vote Leave, the official British campaign to leave the European Union, which was chock full of politicians who rejected climate science.","Vote Leave was run by Dominic Cummings, a former head of strategy for the Conservative Party. The Vote Leave campaign paid £3.5m for Facebook profiling and advertising to AggregateIQ, a Canadian firm which had secretly licensed its data tools to SCL Elections.","Cummings is also connected to SCL Elections and Hanson Asset Management director Patrick Teroerde, through Lord Hanson. From 1999 to 2002, Cummings had run the anti-EU ‘Business for Sterling’ business lobby, founded by Lord Hanson. Neither Teroerde nor Cummings could be reached for comment.","The pro-fossil fuels agenda of the Vote Leave campaign was no secret.","One senior Vote Leave committee member, Andrea Leadsom, currently Leader of the House of Commons and previously energy and climate minister, admitted to questioning climate change science when she first got her ministerial job. During the Brexit campaign, she was aligned with a pressure group agitating for more fossil fuels and less renewables.","Two other Conservative politicians who supported Vote Leave, Owen Paterson and Matt Ridley, are “well-known allies of the UK’s most prominent climate science denial campaign group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation,” according to DeSmogUK.","And so we come full circle. Cambridge Analytica’s political associations with the Trump campaign in the US, and the Brexit campaign in the EU, overlap directly with the firm’s ties to major oil and gas companies and anti-science campaigning to deny climate change.","The story of this firm’s massive breach of Facebook to manipulate public opinion is not just about the increasing impunity of giant technology companies, nor their capacity to allow nefarious entities to interfere in our fragile democracies from outside.","It is about how technology has been used to subvert democracy from within—not by foreign powers—but by increasingly unaccountable corporate power, including those tied to the rampant exploitation of oil, gas and coal. It’s power that continues to hold great sway over governments on both sides of the Atlantic."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

SCL had illegitimately obtained data about Facebook users, and had apparently not destroyed that data when Facebook ordered it to in 2015. Consequently, the company was no longer allowed access to Facebook’s platform. “We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook,” Grewal concluded.","The next morning, it became clear just why SCL and Cambridge Analytica had been suspended so abruptly, and at such an odd hour: because the New York Times and the Observer were prepping major investigative stories about the company’s use of Facebook data, based on documents and other information from a 26-year-old whistle-blower named Christopher Wylie.","Both stories are excellent, and help us better understand exactly what Cambridge Analytica did during the 2016 election (and the primaries before it). But there are a few points worth pulling out and emphasizing.","Facebook was being used as it’s designed, and that’s the problem.","In 2014, while working at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie hired a University of Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan to build a database of psychometric profiles. Cambridge Analytica — funded by the right-wing billionaire Mercer family and advised by then–Breitbart editor-in-chief Steve Bannon — hoped to use the data to target political advertising and influence voter behavior. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk freelance boards, Kogan hired around 270,000 people to fill out a survey in an app that they would install in their Facebook accounts.","Facebook apps, like FarmVille, extend the platform’s usability, but in installing them, users often give third-party developers like Kogan access to a significant amount of their own data. Worse, in 2014, when Kogan’s app was gathering data, Facebook’s terms of service allowed developers to request access to an app installer’s friends as well.","In other words, each of the 270,000 people who were paid to install the app also gave up a significant amount of data about their Facebook friends as well — meaning that from the original 270,000 subjects, Kogan managed to obtain as many as 50 million profiles, including information like locations, job and educational histories, and pages liked. Facebook has since changed privacy settings that mean you can’t be data-betrayed by your inconsiderate or careless friends. But at the time, there was nothing about what Kogan was doing with his app that broke any of Facebook’s rules. It wasn’t until he passed that data on to Cambridge Analytica that he put himself in violation of Facebook’s terms of use.","Facebook has therefore insisted that it was not party to a “breach” of user data. You could argue that this is a semantic argument, largely designed to protect the company from SEC regulations that would have required them to alert users that their data had been mishandled and distributed without explicit permission. Certainly, user trust has been breached, even if no particular server or database was illegally or maliciously accessed.","But I actually agree with Facebook on this point: It wasn’t breached; Kogan obtained profile data perfectly legitimately. I just don’t think that’s a good defense. As hardly needs stating at this point, Facebook’s business model is built on gathering data about its users. (“We … built models to exploit what we knew about [people] and target their inner demons,” Wylie tells the Observer. “That was the basis the entire company was built on.” He’s talking about Cambridge Analytica, but the statement is equally true of Facebook.) You can argue that it was a bad idea to allow a surveillance-advertising company to grow to the size and influence of Facebook. But everyone can agree that the data Facebook has gathered on its users should be better protected, and that users should have better knowledge of and control over that data. Kogan was able to access profiles of 50 million users by paying a mere 270,000 users to install an app — and able to pass that data on to a third party without Facebook’s knowledge — because Facebook made it remarkably easy to obtain information about its users, not because he did something particularly nefarious.","If this has happened once, it’s probably happened more than once.","Kogan ran afoul of the rules by passing the data he’d obtained to a third party — Cambridge Analytica. He’d presented the app to Facebook and to its users as a project gathering for academic research, but then had turned around and given it to a company that had not been named or identified, and which sought to use the data for political, not academic, purposes.","But it’s worth noting that the only reason any of us know that this happened is because of Cambridge Analytica’s prominence in the news. Facebook itself only seems to have become aware that Kogan’s data was being misused in late 2015, after a Guardian report outlined the company’s data-harvesting techniques. Having learned that millions of its users’ data was now in the hands of a company to whom no such permissions had been granted, Facebook demanded that Cambridge Analytica delete that data — and then never followed up.","The fact that all this data was obtained legitimately in the first place, and that the discovery that it had been mishandled was met with only token objection by Facebook, is not, to put it mildly, confidence-inspiring. If the Guardian had never reported on the Cruz campaign’s contract with Cambridge Analytica, would Facebook (or any of us) even know that profile data on so many users was out there? And given that, shouldn’t we be assuming that this same thing — shady mass data-harvesting of Facebook profiles, to be kept on third-party servers — has happened more than once?","Facebook has known about this for a long time, and has done nothing.","The Observer and Times stories are valuable for the level of detail they bring to Cambridge Analytica’s practices, and for the attention they draw to Facebook’s lax privacy protections. But much of the key information in both stories could also be found in an Intercept story from last year — and in the aforementioned Guardian story from December 2015.","It’s easy to be cynical about the sudden attention the story is now getting from the public, given that we’ve had two years to process Cambridge Analytica’s methods. And surely some of the attention is unwarranted — the result of sensationalized chatter about Cambridge Analytica’s overstated role in Trump’s victory. (More on that in a minute.) But Facebook has been silent over the course of those two years, too. To its credit, it’s changed app permissions so that developers can no longer access such a wide network of profiles. Yet even after it was aware that Cambridge Analytica was in possession of mishandled profile data, it did nothing beyond send a letter. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted,” Wylie told the Observer. It’s hard to square that with Facebook lawyer Grewal’s claim that “[p]rotecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do.”","The trouble is with Facebook, not (necessarily) Cambridge Analytica.","Trump’s victory in 2016 was so unexpected, and so close, that a whole cottage industry of explanations for his victory — from the prosaic to the conspiracy-driven — has emerged in its wake. Early coverage of Cambridge Analytica tended toward the sensational: Soon after the election, the Guardian called Cambridge Analytica’s influence “sinister,” and it was suggested in the woollier corners of Twitter that its “psychometric profiles” were not just a deciding factor in the election but a particularly dangerous one.","The truth is that there’s very little evidence that Cambridge Analytica’s particular methods have any different effect on voting behavior than any other digital political campaign efforts. Dave Karpf, a professor at Georgetown and expert in political advocacy on the internet, has called Cambridge Analytica the “Theranos of political data” — a company with “a tremendous marketing department, coupled with a team of research scientists who provide on virtually none of those marketing promises.”","Given the narrowness of Trump’s margins, could Cambridge Analytica have provided the extra nudge that pushed him across the finish line? Sure! And, yes, it’s awfully interesting that Cambridge Analytica employed a Russian-American professor who received funding from the Russian government. But until more reporting is done, that’s all it is — interesting. As Cambridge Analytica itself has resentfully pointed out, the Obama campaign was undertook similar Facebook data-gathering efforts. Those campaigns were aboveboard, and the uses of the data made clear to those who signed up — no small distinction — but they still used Facebook in much the same way. Focusing on Cambridge Analytica as a uniquely sinister actor in the election (or in the world of data acquisition or voter-targeting) ignores exactly how easy, and how mundane, their data-harvesting really was — and how vulnerable your Facebook data really is."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

In fact, whistle was blown about British consultancy Cambridge Analytica for having 'improperly accessed users' information to build profiles on American voters'. And, these were purportedly used to help elect Trump as US president in 2016.","With Zuckerberg himself saying that an app built by a university researcher \"leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014\", the enormity of Facebook's laxity strikes as appalling.","So Zuckerberg who had said 'sorry' only last week in US television interviews has had to issue a full page advertisement saying 'sorry' to Britons again last Sunday. The apologies came in the face of an unabated controversy over the vulnerability of personal data to abuse, let alone the tumbling of the share price value of Facebook. Since the allegations came forth, the social media platform has lost US$ 50 billion in market value. One wouldn't be surprised were there to be deserters among high-profile advertisers.","Thus, we see a full page newspaper advertisement reiterating the first apology which in a nutshell puts forward some self-corrective pledges preceded by a forthright admission of prevailing cracks in the system. Zuckerberg said, \"This was a breach of trust, and I am sorry, we didn't do more at the time,\" presumably in 2014 when the leak was being exposed at some level of the management. \"We have a responsibility to protect your information.

What character on “Downton Abbey” would you be? What breed of dog is best for you? Some enormous percentage of Facebook’s 2.13 billion users must have seen Facebook friends sharing results of various online quizzes. They are sometimes annoying, senseless and a total waste of time. But they are irresistible. Besides, you’re only sharing the results with your family and friends. There’s nothing more innocent, right?","You are being psychographically profiled","Most people have heard of demographics – the term used by advertisers to slice up a market by age, gender, ethnicity and other variables to help them understand customers. In contrast, psychographics measure people’s personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. They help advertisers understand the way you act and who you are.","Historically, psychographic data were much harder to collect and act on than demographics. Today, Facebook is the world’s largest treasure trove of this data. Every day billions of people give the company huge amounts of information about their lives and dreams.","This isn’t a problem when the data are used ethically – like when a company shows you an ad for a pair of sunglasses you recently searched for.","However, it matters a lot when the data are used maliciously – segmenting society into disconnected echo chambers, and custom-crafting misleading messages to manipulate individuals’ opinions and actions.","In 2015, Facebook gave permission to academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan to develop a quiz of his own. Like other quizzes, his was able to capture all of your public information, including name, profile picture, age, gender and birthday; everything you’ve ever posted on your timeline; your entire friends list; all of your photos and the photos you’re tagged in; education history; hometown and current city; everything you’ve ever liked; and information about the device you’re using including your web browser and preferred language.","Kogan shared the data he collected with Cambridge Analytica, which was against Facebook policy – but apparently the company rarely enforced its rules.","Going shopping for impressionable users","Analyzing these data, Cambridge Analytica determined topics that would intrigue users, what kind of political messaging users were susceptible to, how to frame the messages, the content and tone that would motivate users, and how to get them to share it with others. It compiled a shopping list of traits that could be predicted about voters.","This is how Facebook users’ relationships with family and friends are being exploited for monetary profit, and for political gain.","Knowingly putting users at risk","Facebook could have done more to protect users.","The company encouraged developers to build apps for its platform. In return, the apps had access to vast amounts of user data – supposedly subject to those rules that were rarely enforced. But Facebook collected 30 percent of payments made through the apps, so its business interest made it want more apps, doing more things.","People who didn’t fill out quizzes were vulnerable, too. Facebook allowed companies like Cambridge Analytica to collect personal data of friends of quiz takers, without their knowledge or consent. Tens of millions of people’s data were harvested – and many more Facebook users could have been affected by other apps.","Changing culture and politics","That’s exactly what Facebook enabled Cambridge Analytica to do. In 2017, the company’s CEO boasted publicly that it was “able to use data to identify … very large quantities of persuadable voters … that could be influenced to vote for the Trump campaign.”","A healthy dose of skepticism","U.S. history is filled with stories of people sharing their thoughts in the public square. If interested, a passerby could come and listen, sharing in the experience of the narrative.","By combining psychographic profiling, analysis of big data and ad micro-targeting, public discourse in the U.S. has entered a new era. What used to be a public exchange of information and democratic dialogue is now a customized whisper campaign: Groups both ethical and malicious can divide Americans, whispering into the ear of each and every user, nudging them based on their fears and encouraging them to whisper to others who share those fears.","A Cambridge Analytica executive explained: “There are two fundamental human drivers … hopes and fears … and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that evoked that reaction from you. Our job is … to understand those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion.”","The information that you shared on Facebook exposed your hopes and fears. That innocent-looking Facebook quiz isn’t so innocent.","The problem isn’t that this psychographic data were exploited at a massive scale. It’s that platforms like Facebook enable people’s data to be used in ways that take power away from voters and give it to data-analyzing campaigners."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Have you heard of Pepsi? Of course you have. Even if you’re not a soft-drink drinker you’re very familiar with Coke and Pepsi. You’re either a Coke person or a Pepsi person. You know what fast-food franchises sell which drink. They’re not just household words and a part of our culture, they’re ingrained into our psyches. You could be stranded in the most obscure, rural, backward place in a third-world country, and you will find a Coke or a Pepsi. And yet, they continue to advertise.","While it makes sense for Ford, Chevrolet, and Toyota to advertise as they change their product ever so slightly every year, Coke and Pepsi don’t (exception being that failed experiment Coke perpetuated upon us that nearly caused a nationwide riot in the early 1980s). They run commercials for a product with nothing new to add. Only Domino’s Pizza runs commercials saying their old pizza sucked, but now it’s better (and it’s not).","Why do these companies engage in advertising? Because they believe ads work. Advertising is meant to convince you to purchase their product. They’re designed to convince, persuade, and to put it more crudely, manipulate.","So, whenever I hear someone say Russian advertising and fake news on social media didn’t help Donald Trump win the presidency, I know that person is full of crap. How do you argue that the ads your campaign officially paid for worked, and the ads you supposedly weren’t responsible for didn’t?","Every political campaign coordinates an advertising campaign. It’s why the Trump campaign is running ads now for the 2020 presidential campaign. It’s why the Trump campaign worked with a firm like Cambridge Analytica, though now, they claim that company was not an influence on the election.","Cambridge Analytica (CA) is a data mining and analysis company that works on political campaigns. It was heavily involved in the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union, the Ted Cruz campaign, and then the Trump campaign. It’s partly owned by Robert Mercer, a very rich guy who supports extremely conservative causes and politicians. He’s been a major benefactor for Breitbart, and after the Cruz campaign failed, he switched allegiances to the Trump campaign and helped install Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway (who was on the Cruz staff) as heads of the Trump team. As you can tell, Mercer likes assholes.","Cambridge Analytica engaged in some very sketchy activities. The head of the company asked Wikileaks guru Julian Assange to help find Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 missing emails. The company may have used their microtargeting of individuals on social media to help Russia coordinate their propaganda campaign in favor of Trump.","Cambridge Analytica also collected personal data on individuals without their consent or their knowledge. Facebook was aware of this for two years but didn’t act on it until yesterday when they banned CA from advertising on their platform. According to the Trump campaign, CA was working side-by-side with representatives from Facebook and Twitter on their digital campaign.","You wonder how much of an effect CA had as the presidential election was decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in three swing states and the EU referendum by two percent of UK voters.","Collecting personal data on social media users allows the company to learn who is susceptible to certain kinds of advertising and who can be manipulated. For example: Who can be tricked and conned by fake news, who only wants confirmation bias, and who will really believe Pizzagate and that the Pope endorsed Donald Trump? Russian ads and propaganda convinced millions of people the absurdity of Trump being more honest than Hillary Clinton, just like Coca-Cola ads have you convinced penguins and polar bears are on the same continent.","It gets worse. Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica was caught on tape talking to who he believed were prospective clients (but were actually undercover reporters for the UK’s Channel Four), where he described strategies of filming opponents in compromising situations with Ukrainian sex workers. Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, was caught explaining that plausible deniability was a crucial element and said it was vital that people seeing false rumors online never discovered where they were coming from. I discovered it doesn’t matter if people find out where it’s coming from. They’ll still post it and call you a liar when you point out the facts.","Turnbull said, “We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again. Like a remote control. It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda,’ because the moment you think, ‘That’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?'” That sounds very similar to the Russian Troll Farm strategy.","Nix said on the tape, “We do incognito very well indeed, in fact we have many clients who never wish to have our relationship with them made public. We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you.”","Christopher Wylie, a whistle-blower with a guilty conscience from Cambridge Analytica claims CA had used a few hundred thousand people’s Facebook accounts to reach out and scale up through their social networks to touch “most of America.” The company used harvested information from the accounts ‘friends’ profiles as well as updates, likes, and in some cases private messages.","Investigators in the UK are now seeking warrants to enter CA’s offices and seize evidence, and Facebook personnel have been ordered to vacate those offices, and lawmakers are calling for investigations into both companies. The European Union, which has stronger laws about it, is also launching an investigation into the misuse of private data.","Facebook lost $40 billion yesterday as this news hit Wall Street and American lawmakers were demanding investigations.","I believe we make it easy for companies like Cambridge. We believe what we want to believe, thus making it easier to become trolls for a Russian troll farm. Conservatives are better targets as facts don’t support their beliefs to begin with, and people who spread lies associate with other people who spread lies. Facts are not important. Conservatives don’t care if their beliefs are based on lies. They don’t care if spreading those lies makes them traitors. They just want their bias confirmed.","In fact, Nix said on the tape, “It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion.” That’s true. No Trump supporter can tell you why Trump is doing a great job, just that he is. It’s all emotion and a lot of times, their emotions are hatred.","We’ve come down to fighting emotion with facts. I pride myself on only using facts, and I’m losing. The liars and traitors are winning.","Here’s the video.","Please consider making a donation to keep the cartoons, columns, and videos coming.

The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Perhaps some of that relief came from the fact that Wall Street already knew and was comfortable with Larry Kudlow, his replacement.","But likely more than that, markets also noticed that the Trump administration has carved out a \"special place\" for both Canada and Mexico as far as those much-hyped steel and aluminum tariffs are concerned. (Or at least Canada and Mexico will get special treatment for as long as NAFTA negotiations drag on.)","Of course, the spotlight will continue to shine ever more brightly on trade as players watch how President Trump approaches China and protection of U.S. intellectual-property rights. Many clearly placed bets on this last week, as EPFR Global reported that U.S. equity inflows hit a record $43.3 billion for the week ended last Wednesday.","Equity inflows are now running ahead of bond inflows for the first time in roughly five years. But don't look for that in Monday morning's equity-index futures, as S&P 500 futures seem to have rolled off of a cliff after European markets (also trading in the hole) opened for business.","However, how the week plays out will have less to do with Monday's trading and more to do with the Federal Open Market Committee's forward-looking guidance this Wednesday. (Not to mention how new Fed chair Jerome Powell presents himself at his first post-FOMC press conference.)","Yes, there's near certainly among players that the FOMC will tack on another quarter point to the Fed funds rate. That's already priced in. As of December, the famous Fed \"dot plots\" indicated a consensus of three Fed rate hikes this year.","However, Chicago futures traders have flirted for weeks with a roughly one-in-three chance of a fourth rate hike by year's end. For now, that's the key market variable to watch.","Order in the Court","A trial over the proposed merger of AT&T (T) and Time-Warner (TWX) finally starts Monday, and just about everyone who invests in media or telecom stocks will be watching. The U.S. Department of Justice and AT&T will present their respective cases before U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon in response to the DOJ's lawsuit blocking AT&T's intended $85 billion takeover of Time Warner.","What's at stake? More than you think -- for one thing, the question of just who's a competitor and who's not in today's media market.","Does the government recognize the impact of cord-cutting upon cable TV? If so, then this deal isn't quite as significant as it would otherwise seem.","In my opinion, why would you not consider Netflix (NFLX) , Amazon Prime from Amazon (AMZN) and other so-called \"over the top\" streaming services to be part of the modern TV world? That's how many of us watch everything other than news and sports these days.","Of course, if the court views these services as a different type of business altogether, that would mean the merger of AT&T's DirecTV and Time Warner Cable would create a much more dominant player in the TV marketplace. (A dominant position in a dwindling business, if you ask me, but I don't get a say in this.)","If the DOJ successfully blocks the AT&T/Time-Warner merger, what will that say about the 2011 merger of NBC Universal and Comcast (CMCSA) ? Will that deal need modification?","And what about the plan by 21st Century Fox (FOXA) to buy the portion of Sky Plc (SKYAY) that it doesn't already own? Or the $31 billion bid that Comcast has already made for Sky? And what about the agreement by Walt Disney Co. (DIS) to buy much of Fox -- an agreement that prevents Disney from preparing its own bid for Sky?","Who are the potential winners and losers here? I think the winners will be whoever comes away with the most content and the most potential client exposure.","There will be short- to medium-term movement based on how the DOJ defines the TV business. But over the long term, does anyone really see demand for cable-like entertainment making a comeback as my generation withers in numbers and is replaced by Millennials who cut the cord upon adulthood?","Has anyone noticed how NFLX's stock price has risen since the company released its latest earnings report? It doesn't take a genius to see why Disney chief Bob Iger has take DIS in that direction.","At the end of the day, Disney is the king of content in my opinion. And after placing one foot in each part of the TV world (old media and new), DIS might be one of the few companies in the business with any pricing power left.","Things Just Get Messier and Messier for Facebook","Facebook (FB) is down some 3.6% in premarket trading on Monday as I write this.","The company has suspended U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica amid suggestions over the weekend that the British firm had lied about deleting user data that it had gained through the use of a psychology-test application posted on Facebook.com. FB has also suspended Cambridge Analytica parent Strategic Communications Laboratories.","Cambridge Analytica reportedly used the data while doing work in Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, but denies that it misused or even held onto information that it gained from up to 50 million Facebook users.","The company also claims to have fully complied with Facebook's terms of service, and Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal insists that there was no breach of those terms. He claims that Cambridge Analytica \"requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up ... and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","However, both U.S. and U.K. lawmakers made noise about this over the weekend. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey indicated through online posts that she would investigate. British Parliament member Damian Collins also expressed interest in having Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify about the possibility that social-media manipulation impacted the 2016 Brexit vote.","Facebook is outperforming the S&P 500 so far this year -- up about 5% vs. 2% for the broad market -- but badly lags the other FANGs. That might not be a fair comparison given the incredible year that both NFLX (+65%) and Amazon AMZN -- which is up 34% -- seem to be having. But FB lags despite being debt free and boasting the FANGs' best profit margins.","What gives? Do these concerns weigh on the stock's performance?","Zuckerberg has already laid out plans to improve security and slow down the prevalence of \"fake news\" even if that impacts ad revenue. But believe it or not, that commitment could be putting a dent in investor perception of the firm's direction.","Let's go to the chart to explain why I won't buy Facebook if it gaps down Monday.","Chart of the Day 1: Facebook","Those who bet against the FANGs tend to get hurt, so I won't be so bold as to short FB. But I might just take a pass when it comes to a likely dip on Monday.","There are only two things that I see on this chart:","First, the Fibonacci Fan is telling us that the stock will have to reach prices in the $210 area within a couple of weeks for FB to regain trend. If it takes longer than that, Facebook will have to attain considerably higher prices on the same trajectory. One can also easily see a flattening of the stock's ascent so far 2018.","But the second thing that I see is a positive for Facebook. The stock has found help at the fan's first line of support twice now.","That said, the negative is that coming off of January's highs and through the lows of the stock market's February correction, FB has twice been rejected at a 61.8% retracement of that move.","On top of that, the fan's first line of support will likely face a third test on Monday morning. A prudent investor might want to watch this open before taking any action.","Chart Of The Day 2: Oracle","Oracle (ORCL) reports fiscal-third-quarter earnings Monday after the close, and Wall Street is looking for 72 cents in earnings per share (+4%) on $9.77 billion of revenues (+6%).","Oracle disappointed in December with its outlook for the company's all-important cloud-computing business. But let's not forget that the competition there from Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT) , and Salesforce (CRM) is tough.","We've seen lots of volatility in ORCL following the past few quarters' earnings releases. On top of that, we can see here that the name continues to make higher highs and lower lows (although not really in such a tidy pattern):","This broadens the range of potential outcomes following Monday evening's earnings report. So, let's say you're long the name heading into Monday's release. Do you just hope for the best? Maybe, if that's worked for you before.","But while I'm long Oracle as well, I've cut my exposure in half. I'm looking for a move of $3-ish overnight on Monday night.","According to my handy dandy Fibonacci levels, there could be some support in the $50.50 area, although a February pullback reached a 100% retracement of ORCL's previous rise. That said, that was during February's \"flash correction\" for stocks, so I don't know how trustworthy the move is.","So, this is what I'm looking at instead. March 23 $50.50 puts went out at $0.45 on Friday, while March 23 $55 calls ended at $0.36. If I were to sell (write) both, I'd drag in $0.81 worth of revenue and at least my calls would be covered.","The risk would be in having to pay $50.50 for shares (or buying back the puts) when ORCL is trading lower. Now, that $50.50 is well above my current cost basis, but at least this would reduce my shares' net to something like $49.69 thanks to the premium that I'd receive on my options trading.","Of course, Oracle's last sale price will impact the relevant strike prices and premiums offered after options markets open Monday morning, but I think you get the idea.","Sarge's Trading Levels","These are levels to watch Monday for where I think that the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 might either pause or turn:","SPX: 2771, 2763, 2757, 2750, 2742, 2731","RUT: 1608, 1601, 1593, 1586, 1576, 1566","Monday's Earnings Highlights (Consensus EPS Expectations)","After the Close: ORCL ($0.72)","(An earlier version of this column incorrectly referred to trading Oracle options with a Feb. 23 expiration date rather than the correct March 23 one.)","Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money.

What does it contain? Who has access to it? Will it make me feel old?","The idea popped into my head among mounting headlines around the alleged misuse of personal Facebook user data by analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. I wanted to know what, exactly, those potentially in possession of my data might know about me -- so despite the trepidation, I downloaded it anyway.","The results were not exactly encouraging.","This file had everything -- I mean, everything -- from personal contact records that I don't even have stored on my iPhone anymore, to every single image I had sent someone over Messenger. As the title suggests: Things got weird, fast.","And if you're understandably hesitant about downloading your own data, or just considering it, here's what you can expect -- and what the results mean.","I Downloaded My Facebook Data and Things Got Weird","A Snapshot","When you first download a copy of your data archive and unzip it the compressed file (here's a quick how-to), it'll look something like this:","Open the general \"index.htm,\" and you'll see a quick snapshot of all the data available on you, ranging from your general profile to advertisers who have your contact information. Here's what the \"profile\" section of mine looks like, with a few sections removed for the sake of -- this old thing -- privacy.","Granted, what was available on this page was largely information I voluntarily supplied to Facebook by way of putting it on my profile, like where I went to school or my birthday.","But it was in the other sections and file folders where things started to get weird -- and where I started wondering what potential advertisers or others might be doing with it.","The 'Ads' Section","The \"Ads\" section of my data index file largely consists of an exhaustive list of ad topics that would be of interest to me. Some of them made sense, as they were brands whose Pages I already Liked.","But some of the topics were downright irrelevant and, therefore, befuddling -- like \"fishing bait\" and \"organic compound.\"","But there was also a section for advertisers with my contact information, many of whom were brands and musical artists whose Pages I hadn't Liked.","I had to wonder, why do the Smashing Pumpkins and Beck have my contact information? I hadn't listened to either, really, since my first year of college when -- at risk of dating myself -- Facebook didn't exist yet.","It raises questions about just how accessible this information is, and how widespread the availability of our data might be. While likely a bad actor, I'm inclined to believe that Cambridge Analytica isn't alone in the way it allegedly synthesized Facebook user data to get to the root of what sort of promoted content and messaging would resonate most with people.","It's also unclear how to selectively remove that data, if at all -- which could be a valuable next step for Facebook, says HubSpot Product Lead Daria Marmer.","\"Facebook now needs to take the next step and make data deletion from its platform as easy as data access,\" she explains. \"After all, shouldn't it be at least as easy to remove your history/personal information as it is for advertisers to access it?\"","Messenger Records","That became particularly salient when I discovered that my Facebook data includes a transcript of every Messenger interaction I've had, replete with any photo or video files I may have shared in those conversations.","Again, this might not be new. In an April 2014 earnings call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that as part of the social network's ongoing efforts to personalize any content seen by a given user, it would take \"a couple of different approaches towards more private content as well.\"","In the context of the full remarks, it would appear that Zuckerberg was referring to content promotion in these private conversations -- namely, those taking place on Messenger and WhatsApp (also owned by Facebook).","Those plans are increasingly coming to fruition as of late, by way of in-app ads on Messenger (see below image) and the proposed Messenger Broadcast feature.","At the time, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg positioned these efforts as going strictly towarddisplaying Facebook content that users would be \"genuinely happy to see.\"","But to this day, and among recent events, it remains unclear as to which data is, was, or would be used to help target the \"private content\" Zuckerberg alluded to. However, some believe that any user data authorization, including the kind that eventually led to the alleged misuse by Cambridge Analytica, would include Messenger data and files, too.","This personal revelation comes among recent allegations that, on Android devices, Facebook may have been scraping data on calls made and text messages sent from users' mobile devices -- through the device itself, not the Messenger platform.","Here's what that logged activity looked like for one Android user who discovered this record in his own data file:","Facebook's response to this allegation is that users must explicitly opt into allowing Messenger to access contacts and, it seems, log call and text activity. According to a statement published Sunday:","\"When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history. For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’.\"","But according to Ars Technica writer and editor Sean Gallagher, that's not the experience shared by all Android Users.","Even though he never installed Messenger on the Android devices he's used, Gallagher says that after installing Facebook on his Nexus tablet and Blackphone 2 in 2015, his own archive includes call data from between 2015 and 2016. That's after, he says, never receiving \"an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data.\"","Where We Go From Here","If nothing else, it seems that no one is quite sure how, exactly, personal Facebook user data is being leveraged, in whose possession it might be, and how much information those who have it might be privy to.","\"Tech companies have access to an insane amount of our data -- you can even see for yourself on Facebook and Google exactly what they collect,\" says Henry Franco, HubSpot's social campaign strategy associate. \"My guess is there are a ton of Cambridge Analyticas out there, and people would be horrified to realize how many companies are using their data to gently nudge their decision-making processes.\"","This is why Facebook's own investigations might not be enough.","After several days of silence on the initial Cambridge Analytica data misuse allegations, Zuckerberg finally issued a statement on the matter last Thursday, and has been on an active interview and apology circuit since then.","Case in point: Full-page mea culpa ads in the Sunday editions of the New York Times, Washington Post, and Observer (which is published by Guardian, an outlet Facebook threatened to sue before it first reported on the Cambridge Analytica scandal).","But there have been a few key, repetitive themes underlying Zuckerberg's remarks. The first is an emphasis on the words \"I'm sorry,\" which were notably absent from his official written statement released last week.","The second is Zuckerberg's suggested willingness to appear before lawmakers and other authorities to testify on user data and privacy -- if, as he told Recode, he's \"the person who has the most knowledge on it.\"","And because the Federal Trade Commission confirmed today that it is non-publicly investigating Facebook among its \"substantial concerns about the privacy practices,\" Zuckerberg should be prepared to testify -- especially since he's been called upon to do so by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee (along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter).","It all leads to an increasingly likely outcome: that Facebook and its big tech counterparts will have to bow to the external regulation that it's been visibly dodging for some time.","For example, after allegations first came to light that Facebook was weaponized by foreign agents to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election, many wondered if the network instituted its own onslaught of new rules to avoid facing those from lawmakers.","Zuckerberg says he's not entirely opposed to that outcome, saying in an interview with CNN last week that \"I’m not sure we shouldn’t be regulated.\" But if that is the end result, Facebook likely won't be alone in facing that new level of oversight, as implied by the aforementioned invitation to appear before lawmakers alongside executives from Google and Twitter.","And where such regulation is going to have the greatest ripple effect, according to HubSpot Director of Strategic Partnerships Kevin Raheja, is advertising.","\"Facebook, Twitter, and Google will be subjected to, and also adjust to the regulations, likely at the expense of some revenue,\" he says. \"They will likely have to be selective with advertisers, particularly politically-charged messaging ... not just to protect users, but also their own integrity and their own perceptions.\"","The timing also closely aligns with the GDPR coming into force in May. \"With Zuckerberg being asked to testify in front of Congress,\" says Franco, \"one could wonder if we'll see similar data regulation in the U.S.\"","This is a developing story that I'll monitoring as it unfolds.

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements.\"","\"Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices,” read the statement.","Amid allegations of Cambridge Analytica data misuse, Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg last week finally broke his silence over the issue and said his company committed 'mistakes' in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users.","He also explained the various measures his government will take to restrict developers’ access to such information in future.","\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it,\" Mark said in a Facebook post.","Speaking on the Cambridge Analytica isue, Mark said: \"In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends' data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends' data.\"","\"In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the data apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan's could no longer ask for data about. a person's friends unless their friends had also authorized the app. We also required developers to get approval from us before they could request any sensitive data from people. These actions would prevent any app like Kogan's from being able to access so much data today,\" he said.","\"In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data. They provided these certifications,\" he said.","\"Last week, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified. We immediately banned them from using any of our services. Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to confirm this. We're also working with regulators as they investigate what happened,\" Mark said.","He said a 'breach of trust' has been committed.","Mark said he will take steps to 'fix' the trouble.","\"This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that,\" he said.","Stories about US President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign doesn't seem to die down. The latest to have emerged from that controversial election is the role of Trump campaign’s data consultant, Cambridge Analytica, accused of using Facebook data wrongfully to influence the polls, even as the company Tuesday suspended its CEO Alexander Nix after a sting operation caught him discussing potential bribery and entrapment.","According to reports, the UK-based firm used data of millions of Facebook users without their consent to influence the 2016 US elections.","The Board of Cambridge Analytica had announced that it has suspended CEO Alexander Nix with immediate effect, pending a full, independent investigation.","\"In the view of the Board, Mr. Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.","\"We have asked Dr. Alexander Tayler to serve as acting CEO while an independent investigation is launched to review those comments and allegations,\" the company said in a release.","\"We have asked Julian Malins QC to lead this investigation, the findings of which the Board will share publicly in due course,\" it said.","\"The Board will be monitoring the situation closely, working closely with Dr. Tayler, to ensure that Cambridge Analytica, in all of its operations, represents the firm’s values and delivers the\nhighest-quality service to its clients.\"","The statement was released ahead of airing of the expose by Channel 4 News in the UK.","Even though several other apps on Facebook uses user data, Cambridge Analytica has been accused of breaking the rules as it obtained the said data under a veiled motive, telling users that it was for academic use."],"isopubdate":""}

REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo","Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it.","The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.","Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation.","Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers.","“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data.","Pasquale said Facebook’s response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users.","“It amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that’s all they have left,” he said.","Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West.”","“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","With Republicans controlling the Senate’s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.","The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015.","Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.","Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.","Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.","Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.","Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. “We must do better and will,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that “our business depends on it at every level.”","Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.","Nuala O’Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.","Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. “That’s a long time,” she said.","Britain’s data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.","“It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey’s office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Please continue your work because im telling you, there is NO WAY I setup a corp cloud based voice listener.\nYour's is the only way i'm doing it. Might use a small snips gear as next xmas gift(s) :)","That looks fantastic, thanks for pointing it out. I had been entertaining the idea of running my own STT server alongside mycroft to keep everything local ... snips.ai could be a much more simple solution.","Ohh that's exciting. I was excited about Snips when it came out for similar reasons but was really annoyed when they advertised custom trigger words so hard and then withheld it in the premium version.","On first glance, hmmm: why does this open source AI require that I create an account on their webpage before trying it out?","> Mycroft AI, Inc. maintains a device and account management system known as Mycroft Home. Developers may sign up at: https://home.mycroft.ai","By default, mycroft-core is configured to use Home. By saying \"Hey Mycroft, pair my device\" (or any other request verbal request) you will be informed that your device needs to be paired. Mycroft will speak a 6-digit code which you can entered into the pairing page within the Mycroft Home site.","[...]","> If you do not wish to use the Mycroft Home service, you may insert your own API keys into the configuration files listed below in configuration.","Thanks for the info. I was told \"We currently provide custom hotwords only in our enterprise offer.\" so I just equated that to a premium version. Looking forward to seeing the simple device-only trained words. I have a local-only setup so cloud connections of any kind are deal-breakers for my personal use case.","Looks like it can all be done offline + OSS except for Speech-To-Text. But I think the key idea is even if it's using cloud for processing, you can at least trust it isn't listening when it shouldn't be (as long as always-on, wake word detection is offline).","I’ve only played around with mycroft a bit, but I’m pretty sure the language processing occurs via cloud (home.mycroft.ai). As it’s open source, you can plug it into a local STT if you want to. The Snips.ai platform seems like it was designed for keeping everything local out-of-the-box, which is why I’m going to try it out this afternoon! After all, I really only want it to understand a handful of commands, mainly around audio and lights.","It's extremely good. I've been using it for a few years now in multiple locations and it's really incredibly powerful. Turn an old boiler into a smart furnace with a $5 MCU and a relay? Done. Full security system with email notifications containing snapshots from your webcam? Done. Turn old IR remote control into a full-house controller with a $1 IR receiver? Done. Man I love home-assistant.","Do you have any tutorials, docs, code or anywhere you can send me for helpful tips on doing this with an IR remote/receiver? I want to automate a garage door and a gate because I accidentally leave them open all the time and they aren’t easy to see from the house so it would be nice to have a notification or state manager on my phone.","I do something similar, I have an ESP8266 microcontroller hooked up to an IR sender/receiver that I can use to send and receive codes from Home Assistant to control some stuff. The module I use takes care of encoding and decoding the IR and simply dumps it to serial, which the micro reads and forwards to Home Assistant via MQTT (and vice versa). It's this one","but it's not hard to do it with a bare IR emitter and receiver. Unfortunately I haven't had have much time lately to document many of my projects for other people, but you can learn a lot from Youtube and Google these days.","Here's a blog post where the original LIRC component in Home Assistant was developed along with some info about how to use it [1]. In here an A/C unit, a TV, and a stereo are all controlled with one little IR LED.","With a little z-wave door sensor (just a magnetic reed switch), you could have Home Assistant run an automation that says \"If gate is open at 9:30am, close it.\" so then you don't even have to log in to click it.","I use an ultrasonic sensor to detect when the door is open or closed. It's very reliable.","I even wired up Home Assistant to contact me (over sms by sending an email to my number@carrier) if the door has been open for >5 minutes, because I was precisely in your position of forgetting to close it.","> Full security system with email notifications containing snapshots from your webcam?","I've been wanting to add this to my setup. Do you have any more details on what you have done? My main hurdles would be choosing decent cameras that can be used by Home Assistant... Cameras that don't want to phone home all the damn time.","An initial setup (on an older version of HASS) is shown here [1]. That has the basics. I've had good luck with Amcrest cameras actually, which even have a component in HASS [2]. They never phone home (check default settings though, I think they want to at first) and I access the whole thing through a OpenWRT-hosted OpenVPN server hosted on my router(s). I also really want to make sure nothing phones home ever. You can set router-level firewall rules to block WAN access if need be.","There's an \"official\" raspberry pi camera module with mature libraries already written, and I believe it comes in both a regular IR and a No-IR version for night-ish vision.","There are also a ton of different 3D-printable mounts and jigs for them on sites like thingiverse and instructables.","My favorite[1] comes as a kit with the jig, 3 servo motors, and an add-on board for a raspi. Using this I have a live-feed camera that can rotate up to 180 degress on 3 axis that I can control from anywhere in the world using my phone as long as my internet connection is up at home. All hosted locally, even the live feed frontend. It's not hard to build or set up either, took me a lazy day and I'm far from a good coder.","I remembered incorrectly, that PiMoroni kit does not include the 3 servo motors, you need to buy those separately along with the RPi camera module. Luckily the servos required are super common little blue servos that are all over eBay and such for dirt cheap.","OpenVPN yes. I have my router hosting the openvpn, but I think you could do that on the RPi as well. I can't say for _sure_, as I haven't tried it personally, but I think there's more than enough juice on an RPi to host all of that, especially if it's only ever going to handle 1 or 2 simultaneous connections.","I see this argument all the time, but these things are less dangerous than smartphones. First off, they ride off your own network so it is easy to see when they are sending data back home unlike phones which can transfer data over harder to monitor 3rd party networks. They are cheaper and lower powered machines so they can't do a lot of processing on device and can't store a large amount of data for later transfer. They are stationary in your home and therefore likely spend a majority of the time listening to nothing unlike phones which might be at their owners side 24/7. They also only have one source of data which is audio as opposed to the other various sensors phones have like GPS. Finally, if you believe that these companies are shady enough that they are lying to their customers about what these smart speakers are doing, why do you think they aren't lying about what their mobile OSes or apps are doing?","All that said, I believe Apple, Amazon, and Google all have worlds more trust in this area than Facebook.","> they ride off your own network so it is easy to see when they are sending data back home unlike phones which can transfer data over harder to monitor 3rd party networks","…if you use a VPN, then you can check for traffic here as well.","> They are cheaper and lower powered machines so they can't do a lot of processing on device and can't store a large amount of data for later transfer.","HomePod has an Apple A8 processor, and Google Home has some sort of ARM SoC.

Yes you can still sneak data past home networks but it's harder than 3rd party networks. Yes they can be more overlooked, but they still have access to less data than smartphones.","None of the points you make prove that home speakers are as bad or worse than smartphones. The original comment wasn't arguing that smart speakers are safe, they were just pointing out the hypocrisy over owning a smartphone and being against smart speakers.","The main issue with smart speakers is that they're in your home and they have access to continuous power, so they're always on. Sure, they might not have all of the processing power of your flagship smartphone, and you can check their traffic, but this doesn't mean that they aren't less dangerous. With smartphones, you can tell pretty quickly if someone's been recording audio in the background: just check to see if your battery is depleting quickly.

Google and FB are all advertising companies that they relies on reselling your data for targeting, with FB being the more aggressive one for you know, growth.","Neither FB nor Google \"resell\" your data. They use your data to put you into categories. Advertisers choose which categories to advertise to, and if your data puts you into one of those chosen categories then you're shown the ad.","3+ years ago, their Graph API provided much more information than it does today. App developers (CA, in this case) used that open API to get information about the app user's friends, and then stored that data on their own servers (which is and always was against Facebook's Terms of Service).","To the GP's point, the fact that Facebook has stated recently that it will reduce the information provided to third party apps shows that there was still a bigger leak than it cared to admit all along.","That's the right order though I am not sure about the last two. I once listened to a Microsoft exec give a talk on privacy issues regarding Bing, etc. He admitted that for privacy conscious folks Apple was best followed by MS, followed by Google, then FB. He described how there were intense fights within Microsoft regarding whether they should show targeted ads based on email content on Hotmail and the side that wanted to show targeted ads lost out. A large part of the reason was that even though it was a free service, any hint that MS was contemplating going through emails could mean a backlash from giant corporate customers using MS's email products. For Apple, leveraging data has never been a major aim. They do as much as possible locally unlike Google/Amazon which do as much as possible on the cloud. Again, differing cultures of companies born in different eras.","People who use these seem completely oblivious to the fact that you're wiring your home. The important part is these things are always on, always recording, and often sending data back home. You can't monitor all of that, and your phone doesn't do that. Stop with the disingenuous phone argument.","I'll wager with you that if we randomly stopped individuals on the street with Android phones we'd be able to find a significant portion of individuals who have \"Ok Google\" enabled. (I'll concede that this piece of functionality can be disabled.) That said, I'll also wager that for those with the \"Ok Google\" functionality disabled that at least one application on their phone has the microphone permission enabled. I'll even wager that if you own an Android phone you have at least one application with the microphone permission enabled.","Additionally, I can disable the microphone on my home device if I wish with the push of a button. If I'm in public I can't walk around asking every stranger within earshot to \"disable their phone's microphone\".","Now, explain to me, in the case where \"Ok Google\" is enabled; how isn't the phone always recording if \"Ok Google\" works (or \"Hey Siri\" for that matter)?","Given everything covered, is it still \"disingenuous\" to say that a cell phone is minimally as risky as putting any of the devices mentioned in a home if not more due to the inability to control the devices of others?","I can only imagine the SNL fake commercials for this. People are already half-convinced that Facebook is listening through the existing app; every couple of weeks I see friends posting weird coincidences between real-life conversations and Facebook ads.","That's exactly what the Facebook app is on a mobile phone, though. Has access to the microphone to listen whenever it wants (even if it doesn't do it, it has access). Is always on, not just in your home but everywhere you go. Knows who you talk to and where you are and how long you spend there and often what you're doing quite exactly to the details.","There's not much difference between having the Facebook app installed on your phone and this device, in terms of creepiness and data collection capability. Probably their smartphone app creeps me out more, actually.","It would never happen because FAA. Taxis on the other hand are regulated on a state by state and even town by town basis.","Anyway, not much blood to squeeze out of that stone. A 747 fits about 400 passengers and only needs 2 pilots. Doubling or halving the pilot salary will not make a noticable difference in ticket prices.","I'm not sure what the main costs of air travel are, but unlike taxis, it ain't the drivers. I would guess fuel?","It needs many more than that. Depending on the workload it could be 10 or more per plane.","Consider a daily shuttle between LAX-NRT, a 11h40m flight. This will usually require 3 pilots, as pilots cannot legally fly more than 8-9 hours per day. When they arrive, the plane is turned around in a few hours and comes back - but the original crew needs rest, so at least 3 pilots have to be waiting at the other end, ready to go. And when the plane arrives back in LAX, who's going to take it back to tokyo? Those 3 are resting! So straight up that's 9 required, at an absolute minimum, with no margin for sickness or holiday.","Longer segments can require 4 pilots, so again that's 12 at an absolute minimum. Realistically speaking, depending on a whole bunch of factors, airlines would aim to actually have about 15-20 pilots per plane in a long haul heavy scenario.","And we haven't even mentioned cabin crew, which would be 12 or so on our hypothetical 747. So again, multiply that by 3 at a minimum and you've got something like 40 cabin crew per aircraft.","So 15 highly paid pilots (say 150k/yr) and 45 slightly less paid cabin crew (50k/yr) - that's close to $4.5m/yr just on crew. For ONE airplane. You've got to be making $12k/day on that plane just to pay flight staff, let alone ground staff and everything else.","In the world of narrowbodies the economics are even more brutal. If a plane's on the ground it's not making money, so say you try to have the plane in the air 10 hours a day. Due to flying limits over extended periods you would need 8 pilots to fill that with no margin, and probably 8 or so crew for a 737 with 4 active. Realistically you're looking at a crew bill of $2m/yr, or ~$35 per seat per day. Even if you manage to squeeze 7 segments out of the plane per day with 100% load factor that's $5 per ticket just on crew in a market where every single dollar counts.","Now obviously I'm grossly oversimplifying and pretty much every number I mentioned can vary - but not by all that much. I'd say those numbers are at least in the ballpark for a full service carrier and if anything the long haul estimate is probably too low - I've heard up to 24 pilots per plane for long haul carriers like the ME3. So finally the point is, crew wages absolutely make a difference!","Well thank you but actually you are right. Pilots are NOT paid rest. Per regulation they can work 1000 hours per year and they will ensure this is fully utilised. Airlines cannot just hire and not use pilots or, of course, they will jump ship to someone who can.","Attracted by the smell of fresh new data, all the usual suspects are present on this field. More and more smart home speakers/assistants really just look like to me the new 2018 widespread trojan horse way for collecting large amount of new data on users. Pass.","I'd say no, but I have no desire for a home assistant. Aside from the security concerns, the thought of talking to my devices just makes me reflexively gag. I mean, the main thing I like about them is that _I don't have to talk to them_.","I've got some Google Home Minis and I didn't realize how much I use them until I decided to make note of it: I use it to control my TV every night (Play bob's burgers, next episode, pause) and in the morning I ask for the weather and while drinking we ask it random questions we happen to be discussing. At night I say \"bedtime\" and it turns off the TV and lights and my dog knows that means it's time to go to bed and gets up as well. All stuff we used to do on our phones but now ask verbally - I guess I'm saying I find it more convenient now than bringing out my phone and having to type stuff. It becomes way less weird after like a week.","I don't find turning off the tv to be particularly challenging; it's one button on the remote. Maybe this works for you, and fine if it does. I don't really care if it's 'convenient'. I don't want to do it.","I was going to say that I couldn't even imagine the selling point of this to the average consumer, but I'm not someone who uses my Echo for social uses (i.e. calling, or sending/receiving messages). For the FB/Instagram-addicted crowd, I guess I could see the appeal of being able to do voice-activated messaging, and to look at photo albums. And it's not something FB should want to give API access for to Alexa/Google/Siri.","That said, I think as popular as Echo devices are, people already have a bit of paranoia about them, and that's before considering the controversy FB is now undergoing. Unless the hardware is best-in-class, hard to see how this will fare any better than Facebook's failed attempt at its own phone with HTC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_First","I wonder if the disembodied voice projection via Non-Lethal Laser Induced Plasma Effects discussed the other day[1] could be used to trip Alexa and such into recording --but at that point, maybe just putting a surreptitious piggybacking bug into Alexa might be a better alternative.","It's an official-branded skill, \"Amazon STorytime\" that is a built-in for Alexa, e.g. you can invoke it by saying something informal, such as \"Tell me a bedtime story\" or \"Tell me a story\", rather than the way other skills are more narrowly namespaced.","It says the app \"contains curated stories from the Amazon Rapids app library as well as a selection of Audible short stories\". It's pretty good, as it features actors and sound effects. Can't say any of the stories were interesting to me (was hoping for Aesop Fables type stories, which is about all I remember growing up myself).","I couldn't care less about the downvotes - I'm wondering if it's ability to start a multi-question conversation with someone who can't pronounce \"Alexa\" properly is not worth being paranoid about, at what point would you become concerned?","Not remotely an expert on how those algorithms work - but that's kinda what I'm talking about. If I can be confident it won't activate until someone clearly says, \"Alexa\", then I'm not too worried because the older kids understand they're not supposed to mess with it in ways we haven't taught them. If my 2-year-old can activate it when he doesn't remotely say it properly, I'm worried about what he can accidentally do on it, what else activates it accidentally, etc.","Yep, like it's not enough that Facebook already knows a ton of information about your online life, these greedy monsters want to inject a spying device into your offline life. I am not an expert, but I guess that this Facebook product has pretty slim chances to be a hit.","\"\"Facebook has been playing fast and loose with their data ever since they started. ... It was only a matter of time before that data was misused, and I think that advertisers knew that,\" said Andy Amendola, senior director of connections strategy at agency The Community. \"We know there was this line that verges on creepy because we know the consumers' data, but I think that's what makes the advertising work so well.\"","For the most part, agencies are skeptical many people are going to leave Facebook - or at least enough to make a difference for advertisers. The public's attention span is fleeting, noted one executive, and even massive data breaches that affected Yahoo, which included 3 billion accounts, and Equifax - 147.9 million accounts - haven't turned people off those services.","...","In addition, the public already held Facebook in low regard leading up to the scandal. According to app analytics firm Sensor Tower, sentiment about the company during the the two weeks leading up to the Cambridge Analytica stories was already 83 percent negative - and people were still on the platform.\"","\"3.

While Facebook currently produces the majority of its revenue from advertising, that's only the tip of the iceberg. Facebook can do many things to begin diversifying its revenue stream including entertainment or e-commerce.","...","So far Wall Street's opinion on Facebook has not been altered by the data scandal. According to MarketWatch, 37 out 44 analysts rank the stock as a \"buy\".

Over the same interval, the S&P 500 lost 5.1% [3]. (Facebook is in the S&P 500 [4]; the rest of the S&P 500 did better than -5.1%.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The “behavioural microtargeting” company has also received around $2.5m over the past two years from conservative Super Pacs to which Mercer or members of his family have donated.","In an interview with the Guardian last month, Cruz said his funding and outreach apparatus “is very much the Obama model – a data-driven, grassroots-driven campaign – and it is a reason why our campaign is steadily gathering strength”.","Cruz is increasingly seen as a leading Republican contender, uniting factions within the party beyond his evangelical and Tea Party base. In Iowa – the first state to vote in the presidential primary, in less than two months – the outspoken Texas senator dethroned Trump in a poll for the first time this week as the mogul became ensnared in yet more controversy.","Cambridge Analytica has also worked with the Republican candidate Ben Carson, receiving $220,000 from his campaign earlier this year. But the company is more closely involved in Cruz’s presidential bid, with a team of its data scientists currently working at Cruz campaign headquarters in Houston.","Having donated $11m to the main pro-Cruz Super Pac, Keep the Promise I, Mercer is Cruz’s top financier – and the largest individual donor to Super Pacs or outside groups during the presidential election cycle thus far, according to data compiled by the political transparency website Open Secrets.","Mercer’s connections to both the Cruz campaign and the data firm that is apparently helping to power the senator’s advantages were previously reported by Politico and Bloomberg. But political strategists and privacy advocates agreed that Mercer’s parallel funding channels, combined with concerns over the surreptitious, commodified Facebook data – reported here for the first time – represented an intensified collision of billionaire financing and digital targeting on the campaign trail.","“If people begin to be turned off by Trump, the Cruz campaign will probably have a better strategic understanding of the implications and how to capitalize upon them,” said Bud Jackson, a Democratic specialist in digital grassroots campaigning, when asked to review the relationships. “Where a candidate’s campaign may be afraid to go outside the boundaries of ethical behaviour because of a potential public backlash, an outside group may be less afraid.”","In an interview, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said the campaign had contracted Cambridge Analytica “because they’re a market leader and best in the field” but that officials had “done our due diligence”.","“My understanding is all the information is acquired legally and ethically with the permission of the users when they sign up to Facebook,” he said, referring questions about previous research to Cambridge Analytica.","The Guardian contacted Cambridge Analytica prior to publication via email with its findings and a list of detailed questions. Repeated calls were also made to its offices in Washington and New York, as well as its parent company in London. A representative in New York refused to speak with the Guardian and hung up the phone.","After this article was published, Facebook said the company was “carefully investigating this situation” regarding the Cruz campaign.","“[M]isleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do, including banning those companies from Facebook and requiring them to destroy all improperly collected data,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement to the Guardian.","Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist and senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, described the Guardian’s findings as “troubling” and highlighted shortcomings by the FEC to adequately regulate campaigns’ use of data.","“What it essentially means is there is no one regulating campaigns’ privacy data and security practices,” he said. “So it means you have a wild west, where the campaigns can do whatever they want and get away with it.”","Research that seeded data on millions","Documents seen by the Guardian show Cambridge Analytica’s parent, a London-based company called Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL), was first introduced to the concept of using social media data to model human personality traits in early 2014 by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at Cambridge University’s renowned psychology department.","Kogan established his own company in spring that year and began working with SCL to deliver a “large research project” in the US. His stated aim was to get as close to every US Facebook user into the dataset as possible.","The academic used Amazon’s crowdsourcing marketplace Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to access a large pool of Facebook profiles, hoovering up tens of thousands of individuals’ demographic data – names, locations, birthdays, genders – as well as their Facebook “likes”, which offer a range of personal insights.","This was achieved by recruiting MTurk users by paying them about one dollar to take a personality questionnaire that gave access to their Facebook profiles. This raised the alarm among some participants, who flagged Kogan for violating MTurk’s terms of service. “They want you to log into Facebook and then download a bunch of your information,” complained one user at the time.","Crucially, Kogan also captured the same data for each person’s unwitting friends. For every individual recruited on MTurk, he harvested information about their friends, meaning the dataset ballooned significantly in size. Research shows that in 2014, Facebook users had an average of around 340 friends.","Kogan assured the MTurk users their Facebook data would “only be used for research purposes” and remain “anonymous and safe”.","However, the Facebook data was then used to generate sophisticated models of each of their personalities using the so-called “big five” personality traits and characteristics – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism (known as the OCEAN scale).","By summer 2014, Kogan’s company had created an expansive and powerful dataset. His business partner boasted on LinkedIn that their private outfit, Global Science Research (GSR), “owns a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles”.","Documents show SCL agreed to a contract with GSR, whereby it would pay its data collection costs in order to improve “match rates” against SCL’s existing datasets or to enhance GSR’s algorithm’s “national capacity to profile capacity of American citizens”.","In an email, Kogan said he was unable to explain in detail where all the data came from, as he was restricted by various confidentiality agreements. He said SCL is no longer a client.","He said that while GSR often used MTurk for data collection, it “never collected more than a couple thousand responses on MTurk for any one project, or even across all projects for a single client – the vast majority of our MTurk data collection as a company is in the form of surveys only”. He said GSR stores Facebook data anonymously.","Kogan explained that separate from his university role, his private company undertook various commercial ventures relating to data analysis. He said that when GSR collect Facebook data, the terms detail the use that information collected will be put to and make clear to participants that they are giving GSR full permission to use the data and user contribution for any purpose.","He said Cambridge University had “no knowledge of the clients or projects GSR had worked on” and that GSR has never used any data collected as part of his university activities.","‘Packaging voters like they’re consumers’","Today, Cambridge Analytica’s central offering to US politicians is to enable them to use the OCEAN scale in shaping highly targeted campaign messages. This allows candidates like Cruz to campaign on specific issues, but communicate them in multiple ways to different audiences depending on the personal information the company holds about them.","As the company’s CEO, Alexander Nix, explains in a promotional video: “The more you know about someone, the more you can align a campaign with their requirements or their wants and needs.” He did not respond to a request for comment.","Michael Zimmer, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he specialises in privacy and internet ethics, described this as a “particularly problematic” kind of voter targeting that raised broader concerns in the US about “packaging voters like they’re consumers”.","“It’s one thing for a marketer to try to predict if people like Coke or Pepsi,” he said, “but it’s another thing for them to predict things that are much more central to our identity and what’s more personal in how I interact with the world in terms of social and cultural issues.”","Prior to its relationship with Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with a handful of 2014 midterm candidates, according to FEC filings. The firm also secured hundreds of thousands of dollars of business with John Bolton’s Super Pac, formed by the hawkish former UN ambassador to support conservative candidates campaigning on national security issues.","Last week, the Cruz campaign launched a combative TV ad timed to air during a major college football game in Iowa. In the 30-second ad, Cruz vows: “We’ll rebuild our military, we’ll kill the terrorists and every Islamic militant will know – if you wage jihad against us, you’re signing your death warrant.”","Tyler, the Cruz spokesman, said Cambridge Analytica did not work on television advertising for the campaign. “They’re helping with online targeting and messaging, and that’s how we find people online,” he said.","It remains unclear when Mercer’s involvement with Cambridge Analytica began, but FEC filings show the company started working with Super Pacs that the secretive conservative donor has backed during the second half of 2014.","On Wednesday in Washington, Cruz was the only member of the Senate armed services committee to skip a hearing on US strategy to combat the Islamic State. Instead, he travelled to attend a fundraising luncheon in New York hosted by the president of Keep the Promise I, the Super Pac funded by Mercer that, one day earlier, had announced a $600,000 digital advertising strategy to be rolled out via social media in early voting states."],"isopubdate":"2015-12-11"}

It is an arresting ensemble of installations and animations, prints and architectural models.","In the light of recent events, it’s a phrase to stop you in your tracks. Langlands points out, though, that he and Bell felt it was sinister when they read it the first time, on Zuckerberg’s Facebook profile a few years back. Langlands mentions The Circle, Dave Eggers’ satire of the tech industry, and the Orwellian idea therein that privacy is theft – that people who are unwilling to share their most intimate details are somehow depriving other people.","“They’re made to feel guilty about not giving people access into their innermost thoughts or desires,” says Langlands. “When Zuckerberg said this, he must have known exactly what he was talking about. He’s saying, ‘You can’t withhold information from me, I want to have access to all information about you.’ He’s not being transparent about his motives.”","If Zuckerberg’s response to what he called the Cambridge Analytica “situation” was characteristically zealous (he concluded his Facebook post by thanking “believers” in his mission, and pledging to work harder and be better), its tone was not surprising to Langlands and Bell – they have been making work about the tech industry’s quasi-religious shtick for years. The “situation” hasn’t surprised them.","“It was entirely predictable,” says Langlands, “and I don’t mean that in a blase kind of way. We’ve felt the increasing disquiet that everybody else feels about the power these companies have. Five years ago, unless you were reading specialist tech journals or websites, you very rarely saw articles about these issues. Then gradually you saw one every three months, then one a month, then one a week and now there are dozens every day. It’s now a really big issue for public discussion.”","Langlands and Bell’s inquiry into big data behemoths began in 2011. Defining architecture as “the most tangible and enduring record of the way we live”, they embarked on a series of perspectival architectural models of the most emblematic buildings of our time. The Pakistani compound where Bin Laden lived was the first, followed by the Doughnut – the clunky Gensler-designed headquarters for GCHQ in Cheltenham.That set them on a path of discovery of those other, altogether more private enterprises and their so-called campuses: Norman Foster’s glass-ring spaceship for Apple, the Thomas Heatherwick pile for Google, Frank Gehry’s oversized cube for Facebook.","Questioning whether these buildings might define our era in the way that cathedrals defined the middle ages, and factories and stations the industrial revolution, Langlands and Bell’s white bas-relief models are mounted in brightly coloured circles, like specimens. Made from a floating point of view, and with a confusingly compressed perspective – they hover between 2D and 3D – the sculptures are designed to feel unreal. They are intended to make you wonder what you’re looking at, but also just what these companies are up to.","“What they do is intangible and opaque,” says Langlands, “so these huge buildings represent a very big step – they’re making a solid commitment to some kind of programme or agenda which is readable by the public, or at least, which should be. These buildings will become symbolic entities, the focus for attention, for discontent even.”","Of course big data already has perfectly good focal points for that, in the form of the sector’s ever-visible CEOs. When researching the buildings, Langlands says, they noticed how photographs of the company heads would often depict them in poses reminiscent of Byzantine saints: hands clasped or pointing skywards, eyes raised to the heavens, the figures back-lit with a blue or orange glow, “like a halo of some kind”.","“We realised,” Langlands says, “that these people – billionaires in T-shirts and trainers – were employing timeless tropes to present themselves as individuals who could deliver new knowledge and innovation. Like leaders of a cult, I suppose.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

But data’s transformative nature also raises important questions around how the benefits are shared, privacy, public security, openness and democracy, and the institutions that will govern the data revolution.","The delicate interplay between these considerations means that they have to be treated jointly, and at every level of the governance process, from local communities to the international arena. This series of essays by leading scholars and practitioners, which is also published as a special report, will explore topics including the rationale for a data strategy, the role of a data strategy for Canadian industries, and policy considerations for domestic and international data governance.","Subscribe","Footer","This site uses cookies to provide the best online experience.

Nor is there evidence it wasn't. It was simply left accessible to the public for an unspecified period of time.","In a phone interview, Chris Vickery, Upguard's director of cyber risk research, said AggregateIQ had installed a custom version of the open source GitLab software version control and collaboration system.","\"For whatever reason, they configured it to allow registration of new accounts by the public,\" he said.","About a week ago, on March 20, Vickery found the code repo, hosted on a GitLab subdomain of AggregateIQ.com, gitlab.aggregateiq.com.","AggregateIQ GitLab Repository","Explanation of Primary Data Storage","Accessing the URL allowed him to register simply by providing an email address. After that, he was able to see the firm's tools and data.","Vickery said he informed federal authorities of his findings but declined to name the specific agency, per the agency's request. He also said he informed AggregateIQ, and the biz shut down access 11 minutes later.","Upguard suggests the material found – apparently used to support US Senator Ted Cruz's failed 2016 presidential campaign – raises questions about the firm's alleged ties to Cambridge Analytica, which received $5.8 million for services rendered from the Cruz campaign.","US Senator Ted Cruz's VoiceMail Script: Ripon_canvas","Ripon_dialer utilizing phonebanking utility.","Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based data analytics firm, stands at the center of the current Facebook privacy scandal, a consequence of the biz obtaining about 50 million Facebook profiles from a researcher who took advantage of the social media site's former policy of letting app devs gather info on app users and all of their friends.","AggregateIQ has been linked to Cambridge Analytica in press reports; Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix (currently suspended after undercover video of him discussing his company's tactics) has acknowledged using AggregateIQ in the past to develop software applications.","A Guardian/Observer report from May 2017 alleges that Wylie, the whistleblower who helped bring the Facebook data scandal to the fore, brought AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica together.","The report asserts that at one point, AggregateIQ’s address and phone number were the same as the address and phone listed for SCL Canada on Cambridge Analytica’s website.","On Saturday, AggregateIQ issued a statement to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL and to assert that it has never knowingly been involved in illegal activity.","\"AggregateIQ has never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL,\" the Canadian company said. \"Aggregate IQ has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica. Chris Wylie has never been employed by AggregateIQ.\"","I find it hard to believe that there would be such a non-relationship as they describe,\" he said. \"I've seen compelling evidence the to contrary.","Upguard says it discovered \"a set of sophisticated applications, data management programs, advertising trackers, and information databases that collectively could be used to target and influence individuals through a variety of methods, including automated phone calls, emails, political websites, volunteer canvassing, and Facebook ads.\"","The security biz also said it found various credentials, keys, hashes, usernames, and passwords to access AggregateIQ accounts, which would allow hackers who obtained the information to compromise accounts. Vickery clarified that the databases were not directly exposed.","These are the tools used to interact with the data,\" he said. \"These aren't the databases themselves.","The credentials to access the databases through these tools were available but he said he did not use them – using someone else's credentials to login without authorization carries a potential legal risk.","But, said Vickery, there's mention of the Republican National Committee and a significant data store.

{"originalurl":"http://thepolitics.in/blog/post/facebook-cambridge-analytica-row-raises-questions-about-regulation-privacy","title":"ThePolitics.in","text":["Just like mass media, social media too has the power to amplify a message. But unlike mass media it is not governed by laws of defamation, libel at all.","Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook shared data with a Cambridge-based Russian researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, in 2013. He in turn sold the data on approximately 50 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica (CA), a political consulting firm that works on elections in several countries across the world.","That, in short, is the crux of the Facebook-CA fracas which lopped nearly $50 billion from the social media giant’s market capitalisation last week. That is a body blow for a firm that has hardly any physical assets (about $14 billion). Its entire business is built on the perception of its value. Facebook’s bread, butter and jam or $39.9 billion of its $40.6 billion revenues in 2017 came from advertising targeted at its 2.1 billion monthly active users. The more they reveal of themselves, their preferences, the more they share, the sharper advertisers can target them and the more the revenues Facebook makes.","Much of the hullabaloo then raises two questions from the Indian perspective.","One, should we finally acknowledge the power of social media/search firms to aid and harm democracy just like mainstream media firms and start treating them as such? There are several arguments against this—the most important being that these are “tech platforms” and cannot be treated like, say, The Times of India or Dainik Jagran. That is not entirely correct.","Just like mass media, Facebook, Google or Twitter too try to get audiences and monetise them—either though advertising, search or pay revenues. If there weren’t 2.1 billion people on Facebook opening up their hearts advertisers would not be interested in it. Just like mass media, social media too has the power to amplify a message. But unlike mass media it is not governed by laws of defamation, libel et al. The result is fake news. Many recent riots, lynchings and conflicts in India have turned out to be the result of a fake video or WhatsApp message.","There are murmurs about self-regulation. But it doesn’t always work, especially in a largely ad-supported ecosystem. In newspapers, self-regulation works but not hundred per cent. In news television it is a mess, surmises a report from The Hoot earlier this week.","That is not surprising given the texture of the medium. There are 389 24-hour news channels in India. The pressure to fill those hours makes them create news, opinions, history or even embellish the truth. To avoid a similar situation it is time for digital publishers to come together and work on a punitive, actionable code of conduct that applies to anyone putting out content online.","The second question the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica controversy raises is of privacy. The Aadhaar case is still being heard in the Supreme Court. Once a judgment comes many of the questions about state or private collection of citizens’ data should get clarified. But here is a not-so-popular point of view. When you sign up and discuss your feelings, thoughts, ideology on a public platform, share pictures of yourself, your family and friends, do you wonder or worry about who is paying for this privilege? More than 2.1 billion people talk about everything online without paying a cent. If the company that offers that service monetises the content why should it be a surprise? To use a quote that Scott Goodson, co-founder of New York-based marketing agency Strawberry Frog used in a book—“If you’re not paying for it; you are the product.”","Don’t get this wrong. To my mind privacy is a fundamental right. But with it comes the responsibility to guard it—a caveat emptor of sorts. It is unrealistic to expect a large corporation, set up to deliver returns to shareholders, to","guard your privacy. To be profitable and grow Facebook has to monetise what is on its platform. Yet Facebook wouldn’t be Facebook without its 2.1 billion users. They both feed off each other in a loosely defined ecosystem that has no precedent.","There is an inherent conflict in our voracious use of social media and digital platforms and our need for privacy. Till that conflict is resolved episodes like Cambridge Analytica will not go away.","Disclaimer:","This article was published in Business Standard and authored by Vanita Kohli Khandekar, she is independent media consultant and writer.

(Facebook did not immediately reply to request for comment.)","On Wednesday, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg finally released a statement. “In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way,” he wrote on Facebook. “But there’s more we need to do.” Zuckerberg pledged to be more vigilant with third party apps from accessing user data.","“While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn’t change what happened in the past,” he said. “We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.”","Facebook has been widely criticized over the mishandled data, but the company didn’t do anything illegal, said Jamie Court, president of consumer protection group Consumer Watchdog — and that’s part of the problem.","“Unfortunately, under federal law these companies are often not held accountable for privacy violations,” he said. “They have been able to fend off legal accountability regarding the actions of third parties even when they essentially conspire with them.”","He said it is up to the Federal Trade Commission to enforce existing regulations on these companies and to Congress to pass better laws protecting consumers. (The FTC did not respond to request for comment.)","A bill passed by the House in February aims to hold websites accountable for what third parties host on their platforms. It’s one of the first to chip away at the protections big tech companies have in the U.S. Another ballot measure proposed in California for the 2018 elections requires companies to disclose exactly what data they collect and how it is handled.","Here are some measures you can take to minimize the hold it has on your privacy:","Revoke access from connected apps","When you give permission for games and other apps to access your Facebook account, third-party companies can often crawl your phone for more data, including your friends’ contact information. That’s how Cambridge Analytica allegedly retrieved the information of 50 million users from just a few hundred thousand people who opted to take a free personality quiz on Facebook.","• Click the “X” on the right of each app to revoke access to your data.","• Confirm “remove” when the window prompts you to do so.","You can also disable Facebook’s “platform” feature, which stops Facebook from integrating with games and other apps for login purposes in the future.","See what Facebook knows about you and opt out","If you live in the U.K. or the European Union, Facebook is required to let you see what information is collected on you. You can find the option to download data under settings. Even if you don’t live in a place with strict privacy laws — like the U.S., for example — Facebook lets users see what is collected on them in other ways.","Under “Facebook Ads,” users can see what information Facebook thinks it knows about them. This will include pages you’ve actually liked as well as interests the algorithm has inferred you have based on your behavior (including card games, thriller movies, and romance novels). You can remove these ads by clicking the “x” in the top right corner of each image. Although it does not stop companies from tracking you, it will make your ads less personalized.","Facebook says you can opt out of these ads under “ad settings,” but the program only allows you to opt out of around 100 specific companies, it also relies on cookies and — as privacy organization the Electronic Frontier Foundation has noted — “does not actually stop tracking,” including that allegedly carried out by Cambridge Analytica.","An example from the author’s Facebook page.","Limit visibility","Under “privacy settings and tools,” you can limit who sees future posts, who can send friend requests, who can see your friend list, and who can look you up using the email or phone number linked to your account. (This is especially advisable for friends who you don’t know very well.) Of course, this won’t stop Facebook from mining data from you but will limit the amount of information other users can see about you online. You can also opt out of “face recognition” under “face recognition settings.”","Turn off location services","You may want to consider opting out of location-stamping posts, especially if they are public. This won’t limit what Facebook collects on you, but can limit your visibility on the internet. Simply click the “X” next to the name of the city on your status avoid revealing where you are. Facebook’s main app as well as its Messenger app also track user location. You can turn this off on iOS under ”settings,” “location services,” and toggling them “off” for Facebook. On Android, it is under “settings,” “app,” “permissions.”","Call your elected officials","Few consumer privacy protection laws exist in the U.S., Court of Consumer Watchdog said, and those that do center on identity theft and require proof of financial damage due to an identity crime. To change that, consumers need to demand more.","“The public needs to rise up if Congress is ever going to challenge Facebook,” Court said. “The problem is politicians are elected by the same privacy violations consumers are against.”","The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy organization, sends out email updates on how to take action against laws that threaten consumer privacy, or use the site to look up your representative’s contact information.","Delete your account","The only way to truly get Facebook to stop tracking you is to delete your account entirely.","“If you use Facebook, the price you pay is your data,” said B.J. Mendelson, author of ‘Privacy: And How to Get it Back’ “You can’t really avoid these leaks. The change has to come through Facebook itself (and the other tech companies) or through regulation of those companies.”","Facebook allows users to deactivate an account temporarily or delete it permanently, although it does not say it will delete the data it holds on users after they go.","Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

It was at the time the most expensive U.S. Senate race in history with total spending of more than $121 million.","Cambridge Analytica put a page about Tillis’ race on its website, touting its work and listing the race as a case study.","“Our telecanvassing program contacted 123,138 individuals, resulting in an increase in turnout of 12.57% among those called, which is equivalent to over 15,478 voters,” Cambridge Analytica says.","Tillis won by 48,511 votes.","Cambridge Analytica’s data told Tillis to highlight Hagan’s absences on the Senate Armed Services Committee to reach a certain group of voters. Tillis hammered Hagan in ads and debates on her absences and the rise of ISIS and jumped on her acknowledgement that she skipped a national security meeting to attend a fundraiser.","“We were able to design and deploy messages tailored to these audiences according to their particular psychographic profiles. This was done through a telecanvassing program and a large scale direct mail campaign that demonstrably increased their likelihood of voting, and voting Republican,” Cambridge Analytica said on its site.","Tillis’ campaign committee paid the firm $10,000 on Oct. 21, 2014, and $20,000 on Nov. 6, 2014.

After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement.","Facebook is investigating Cambridge Analytica’s claims that all the data was deleted, the social media giant said.","“This Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign; personality targeted advertising was not carried out for this client either. The company has made this clear since 2016.”","The North Carolina Republican Party paid Cambridge Analytica $215,000 in 2014 and 2015, according to the Federal Elections Commission. The payments were “microtargeting consulting fees.”","Dallas Woodhouse, the NC GOP’s executive director, said the company was one of many hired to work on direct mail. Woodhouse said he could not find a contract the party signed with the company.","Cambridge Analytica did not do social media work for the party, said Woodhouse, who was hired as state executive director in September 2015.","Even though federal filings show a June 2015 payment to the company of more than $57,000, Woodhouse said the company’s work for the party ended with the 2014 election cycle.","“There are no plans to use them again,” he said.","Rep. Patrick McHenry, a Republican from Denver in western North Carolina, paid Cambridge Analytica $15,000 for “polling and research” work in 2014, according to FEC filings. A spokesman for McHenry’s campaign couldn’t be reached Monday.","Wayne Goodwin, the chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, said the reports about Cambridge Analytica make him “wonder whether North Carolina was used as a trial run in 2014.”","Goodwin is also concerned about Russian ties to those involved in handling the data.","“Given we’re talking about foreign intervention in our national and state elections, it would seem highly reasonable for anybody to avoid using Cambridge Analytica,” he said. “There are too many unanswered questions, too much we don’t know yet.”","Get today’s top stories right in your inbox.

The Observer said it was headed at the time by Steve Bannon, a top Trump adviser until he was fired last summer.","“In 2015, we learned that … Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe,” Facebook said in a posting late on Friday by its vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal.","Kogan also improperly shared the data with Wylie, it said.","AdvertisementAdvertisement","Kogan’s app, thisisyourdigitallife, offered a personality prediction test, describing itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","Some 270,000 people downloaded the app, allowing Kogan to access information such as the city listed on their profile, or content they had “liked.”","“However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong,” the Observer reported.","Facebook later pushed back against the claim of a data breach, issuing a fresh statement on Saturday that suggested the misused data was limited to those who voluntarily took the test.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” Grewal said.","Cambridge Analytica meanwhile said it was in touch with Facebook “in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible .”","It blamed the misuse of data on Kogan and said it has since deleted all the data it received from a company he founded, Global Science Research (GSR).","“No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,” it said.","‘TARGETING THEIR INNER DEMONS’","But Wylie, who later became a whistleblower, told the Observer: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles.

OK, for the people who know me that's not really a secret, but I still need to put that out there because it's true. I would gladly pay for anything with dollars than data, and that includes Android or Chrome or any of Google's other services. Not because I think my data would be handled better if I were to exchange money, but because I'd rather not share it at all. Having said that, I know that I have to if I want to be able to use products or services that are worth a damn.","That's because of the same things that got Facebook into its latest privacy mess. The same data that can be used to allegedly influence voters by lying to them is also used to make life easier through personalization. The difference is not the data itself or how it's being collected; the difference is the company that is doing it and how honest it is. Unfortunately, that's hard to measure, and companies that do snatch up our information are all over the map when it comes to transparency and integrity.","I'd rather pay for Android updates with dollars than data, but inevitably the services wouldn't be nearly as good if I could.","By now I imagine everyone is tired of hearing about Facebook. Well, too bad because I know me and plenty of other people are never going to stop talking about its practices and why it doesn't deserve your trust. I also won't bother telling anyone to delete Facebook since the people that actually care about what Facebook did and what it will do again if given a chance already did the thing. No number of hashtags or witty sayings will make a difference, nor will being that guy who says \"I told you so!\" then remarks on how he deleted Facebook before it was cool. But I'll always have plenty to say when it comes to companies that use our data to make their millions, what we get in return, and what we need to know about all of it.","I want to start by clearing up some misconceptions about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Facebook did not sell your data to anyone, and seeing people who know better claiming it did is disheartening. What Facebook did was worse — it sold access to your data. And because of how Facebook tracks you across its platform and the web itself, it sold access to my data as well even though it doesn't have any of it. That's the most important distinction; Facebook tracks and keeps enough data that if you talk to me and someone else talks to me, it can build a profile on me based on the things we talked about. Then it lets someone else have access to that data without your or my approval.","Facebook isn't the only company that collects huge amounts of data about us each and every day. The elephant in the room here is Google, of course, but every other company that provides a service to you, whether that service is free or paid, also collects data. The amount and type of data can vary; I use Signal for messaging and know it collects some user data, but not nearly as much or as sensitive as the data Google collects. I also use products and services from Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Valve, Ubisoft, and the list goes on and each and every one of them collects user data from me. Some of them are more transparent about what they collect and how than others are, but so far none of them have sunk to the Facebook level of dishonesty about what they have on me and what they plan to do with it.","Did I trade my email address for a free copy of FarCry 5 when it launches in a few days? You bet I did, and now I need to hope Ubisoft is cool and doesn't abuse my trust.","I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that most everyone reading this is familiar with Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. Each of these smart assistants has a level of personalization that changes what it is capable of, and if you've used them all it's easy to say something like Google Assistant knows more about you and can do more for you than Siri, for example. That's because Google collects and uses more pertinent data than Apple does. Both companies collect the same types of data, both inform you about what they collect and how they will use it, but Google has to retain and aggregate more of it to offer the personalization that makes you want to use its product because that's how Google makes money. It makes you want to use a thing, and by using it you provide an even better profile of yourself that it can anonymize and use to target advertisements. Apple makes money by selling you a physical product. Microsoft is somewhere in the middle.","What's important is to realize that these personalized services are built using the same methods that Cambridge Analytica allegedly used to profile people it thought were low-information voters and influence an election. Collect enough information about a person and it's almost like you know their likes and dislikes well enough to manipulate them. Maybe you want to convince them to vote a certain way, or maybe you want to show them products they will want to buy. At some basic level, there's little or no difference and data collection itself isn't the bad guy. It can be, but it can also be the good guy who reminds you that your anniversary is coming up or that you have a doctor appointment next Tuesday at 1:50.","If Google were to follow Facebook's playbook the results would be far worse than potentially influencing an election. Let's hope it never happens.","The \"bad guy\" can only be the company that uses this data in ways that aren't clear to its users. The really bad guy is the company that not only mistreats its customers but has means for third parties to jump in and molest our data for a fee. Facebook has thrown red flags when it comes to privacy for years by doing things like changing privacy settings when features are added, or playing loose with developer agreements and breaking rules about how they send app updates out. 'Dishonest' is really the only word I can find that describes my opinion of the company as a whole.","In contrast, Google is parked atop a mountain of the very same types of sensitive data from over one billion people. So is Apple. So is Microsoft. The difference is that they aren't doing things with it that expose it to others or something even worse. Each company has had its share of mishaps, and those mishaps correlate against the amount of data they collect; Apple has had privacy issues, Microsoft has had a few more, and Google has had even more. But so far they haven't been found to be doing anything malicious and privacy blunders are the result of bad decisions or bugs in the giant machines.","And that's the distinction that's not being made when we read someone saying we are a product and not a customer when we use free services in exchange for giving up our precious data. That's lazy and people need to stop saying it and start talking about it instead.","Jerry Hildenbrand","Jerry is Mobile Nation's resident nerd and proud of it. There's nothing he can't take apart, but many things he can't reassemble.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}
{"originalurl":"https://hbr.org/2016/03/psychographics-are-just-as-important-for-marketers-as-demographics","title":"Psychographics Are Just as Important for Marketers as Demographics","text":["Psychographics Are Just as Important for Marketers as Demographics","Marketers are used to thinking and speaking in demographics, since slicing a market up by age, gender, ethnicity and other broad variables can help to understand the differences and commonalities among customers. Think “our target audience is 14- to 34-year-olds” or “we are launching a campaign aimed at urban Latinos.” But psychographics, which measure customers’ attitudes and interests rather than “objective” demographic criteria, can provide deep insight that complements what we learn from demographics.","Until recently, however, it was a lot harder to get psychographics than demographics, and even if you had psychographic data, it wasn’t always obvious how to make it actionable. The internet has changed the relative importance of demographics and psychographics to marketers in three key ways: by making psychographics more actionable, by making psychographic differences more important, and by making psychographic insight easier to access.","To see the value of psychographics, let’s look at the case of the family tech market and what exactly gets missed when we assess that market through demographics alone (the subject of my presentation at SXSW). Yes, families with different incomes, or with younger and older kids, make somewhat different technology purchases. But their reasons for purchasing are much more closely tied to parent psychographics.","Parents who trust their kids to make their own tech decisions (whom I call “enablers”) tend to evaluate their tech purchases in terms of fun and entertainment value. Parents who focus on minimizing screen time (“limiters”) gravitate towards software and devices that support their kids’ literacy, math, and academic skills. Parents who actively guide and encourage their kids’ technology use typically look for purchases that offer a balance of fun and educational value, and that offer ways to engage and play as a family.","When you understand these kinds of psychographic differences, online marketing tools will make your insight actionable in a way that was nearly impossible before the heyday of Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Using psychographics allows you to do smarter keyword targeting – for example, targeting one message about your programming game to parents who are searching for “kids programming” and another message to parents who are searching for “kids videogames fun.” Once you know the key differences in what your customers care about, you can target Facebook ads to parents who’ve liked specific pages or identified particular interests; you can figure out the hashtags that different psychographic groups use on Twitter, and target different tweets (or even different accounts) to those groups.","The internet has made these kinds of psychographic differences much more apparent and relevant to both consumers and marketers alike. It also makes it easier to find like-minded souls, so people spend more and more time engaging with people who share their particular interests and attitudes, even if they’re from a different community or country: those online tribes help to consolidate psychographic differences, and lead people to identify more and more with their communities of interest or value rather than their geographic or demographic community.","At the same time — as anyone who’s ever read a YouTube comment thread can attest — online discussions are often intense and polarizing. The psychographic identities that develop and deepen online can erupt into active conflict between groups, which provides both opportunities and challenges for marketers. Conflicts can help you identify key psychographics: the Facebook arguments between pro- and anti-screen parents inspired my research into parents’ tech attitudes. But conflicts can also make it difficult to speak to your audience, since a marketing strategy that extolls the play value of a tech device would turn off some parents, while delighting others.","That’s exactly why psychographic data is so essential: it gives you a roadmap for navigating these types of divisions and sensitivities. Here, the latest generation of online research tools is a tremendous asset. Online customer communities let you ask about a range of consumer attitudes: my own data on 10,000 North American parents was gathered from two such communities. Social media analytics let you identify trends in interests and attitudes, and even use sentiment analysis to help dig a little more deeply into psychographic attitudes. Social media monitoring is hugely valuable, too, since the organic conversations that emerge online may help you spot emerging issues or psychographic clusters.","While the internet has made psychographics more important than ever, today’s research, analytics, and ad targeting make it newly possible to turn those psychographics into the foundation of a robust market research and marketing strategy. Indeed, in the best-case scenario, thoughtful use of psychographics will help you develop not only the messages and campaigns but also the products and services that specific customers want and need."],"isopubdate":"2016-03-11"}

Around 270,000 people agreed to take the test, but Facebook's terms of service and API at the time allowed the firm to also collect the data of the participants' friends - or the information of more than 50 million people.","The company's shares closed down nearly 7.0 percent on Monday, wiping nearly US$40 billion off its market value following the revelation.","Cambridge Analytica said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data.","The scrutiny presents a fresh threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway US voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","\"We do have some concerns,” said Ron Bates, portfolio manager on the US$131 million 1919 Socially Responsive Balanced Fund, a Facebook shareholder.","“The big issue of the day around customer incidents and data is something that has been discussed among ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) investors for some time and has been a concern.”","Bates said he was encouraged by the fact that the company has acknowledged the privacy issues and was responding, and thinks it remains an appropriate investment for now.","Facebook on Monday said it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, and the company had agreed to comply and give the forensics firm complete access to their servers and systems.","“What would be a deal-breaker for us would be if we saw this recurring and we saw significant risk to the consumer around privacy,” Bates said.","New York City comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees US$193 billion in city pension fund assets, on Monday said that “as investors in Facebook, we’re closely following what are very alarming reports\".","Sustainalytics BV, a widely used research service that rates companies on their ESG performance for investors, said it was reviewing its Facebook rating, which is currently “average.”","“We’re definitely taking a look at it to see if there should be some change,” said Matthew Barg, research manager at Sustainalytics.","“Their business model is so closely tied to having access to consumer data and building off that access. You want to see that they understand that and care about that.”","Wall Street investors, including ESG funds, have ridden the tech sector to record highs in recent months, betting on further outsized returns from stocks including Facebook, Apple and Google parent Alphabet.","Jennifer Sireklove, director of responsible investing at Parametric, a money manager with US$200 billion in assets, said an increasing number of ethics-focused investors were avoiding Facebook and other social media companies, even before the most recent reports about privacy breaches.","“More investors are starting to question whether these companies are contributing to a fair and well-informed public marketplace, or are we becoming all the more fragmented because of the ways in which these companies are operating,” she said.","New EU privacy rules","Facebook is also facing substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May.","Privacy experts said the data harvesting scandal was a prime example of the kinds of practices the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.","The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.","Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it “would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue”, said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems.","Because a UK company (Cambridge Analytica) was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, the GDPR would have applied.","Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.","“The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn’t adequately monitoring what third parties were doing,” said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.","Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.","Facebook on Monday said it changed its policies in 2015 to “to give much less data, especially about friends\".","“We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,” the company said.","“We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”","Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook’s overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.","The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.","“If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,” Deutsche Bank warned.","The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.","GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans’ consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.","Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.","“There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,” she said.","Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.","For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.","The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.","Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented “in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language\".","In other words, the days of extensive “terms of service” agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, according to privacy lawyers.","In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more “permissions screens” and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.","That could depress usage, Facebook CFO David Wehner said at an investor conference last month.","“Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there’s some potential that people decide they’re not going to use the product,” Wehner said.","\"We don’t think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.”","All rights reserved.

His departure reportedly comes as a result of disagreements over how to handle the spread of misinformation on the social network. As part of Stamos leaving, Facebook has reportedly broken down and reassigned his security team. Almost all of the 120 employees have now been reassigned to product and infrastructure teams, according to the report; it’s unclear if Facebook maintains some other dedicated security team, or if this means security teams are now integrated into other departments.\nStamos’ departure was reportedly decided on last year, but the company decided to keep him on until August to help transition his duties to others — and so that it wouldn’t look quite as bad for Facebook amid continued discoveries about Russia’s abuse of the platform during the 2016 US election. With the news breaking days after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it actually looks worse.\nThe report indicates that Stamos wanted to be more open about security issues than other executives inside Facebook. He reportedly began investigating Russian activity in July 2016 and later pushed the company, sometimes unsuccessfully, to be open about its findings. According to the report, Facebook executives appear to be unhappy with Stamos’ approach and seem to blame much of the recent backlash against the company on the decision to disclose information about Russian election tampering, rather than stay quiet.","In a tweet, Stamos said his role has changed inside of Facebook but that he remains “fully engaged.” However, he did not deny that he would be leaving. “I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security,” Stamos wrote. Reuters also reported that he would be departing in August and that his responsibilities had been “taken away.”\nFacebook said in an emailed statement that Stamos remains the company’s chief security officer, without acknowledging any change in his role. But like Stamos’ tweet, the statement doesn’t deny that he’ll be leaving. “Alex Stamos continues to be the Chief Security Officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a spokesperson said. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”\nStamos started at Facebook in 2015. Prior to that, he was the chief information security officer at Yahoo. According to Reuters, he resigned after a year after discovering that Yahoo had secretly built a program to scan all incoming email for the NSA or FBI.\nIn recent months, Stamos has been among the Facebook executives willing to talk about the company and its ongoing problems on Twitter. Over the weekend, he took issue with the characterization of Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook info as a “data breach,” since hackers did not penetrate any systems. In fact, Facebook was set up to allow third parties to misuse data without any such difficulty."],"isopubdate":""}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Known as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, it is the largest marine oil spill in the world, and also the largest environmental disaster in US history, which is still haunting the world.","2018 witnessed yet another spill, this time it is not oil, but data which is termed as the new oil of industrialized internet economy. Yes, I am talking about the facebook and Cambridge Analytica data scandal, in which privacy of tens of millions of citizens is violated and exploited for private financial gain, without the consent or knowledge of the affected people.","With the rise of digital unicorns such as Amazon, Google, and facebook, data is increasingly viewed as the new oil of the digital world. Just as oil was the vital and essential commodity that powered the manufacturing era, data is the indispensable fuel powering the connected, digital economy.","Oil has been a tightly regulated commodity for more than a century, it consolidated power centres and created new power centres. What will happen to data, the new oil of this world, will it also play a role in defining power centres than just remaining in data centres?","What is this oil..err data spill leading us to?","Let’s consider what has happened in the current Cambridge Analytica and facebook scandal:","As part of its policy to transform itself into a popular platform for social applications, facebook provided access to third-party app developers.","To encourage wider usage, facebook enabled people to log into apps and share information about their friends","One such third-party developer was able to gain unauthorized access to hundreds of thousands of user-accounts, which was subsequently shared with Cambridge Analytica.","Even though complete story of what transpired is not yet known – it is reasonable to state that Cambridge Analytica has utilized its unauthorized access to user data towards behavioural influencing, in this case specifically how they vote.","What’s evident from this fiasco is that, in the current context of widespread collection of data from millions of unsuspecting people, we need to clearly distinguish and differentiate between:","deriving insights and influencing behaviour","what is moral from what is ethical","privacy and individual rights","Is Cambridge Analytica just one of the businesses that got caught, while there are many more such unscrupulous companies that are exploiting public data for private gain? My own view is that there are many ambitious baby corns, that are exploiting the lax regulatory environment, and playing fast and loose with public data, often without their consent or knowledge.","Is history repeating itself?","I have an eerie feeling that the current digital landscape and the largely unregulated atmosphere in which some of the players are operating is like the wild west of the late 19th century. Some of these new unicorns and the baby corns (whose sole purpose is to be acquired by the unicorns) are behaving fast and loose, very much like the wildcatters of the oil industry.","There is another key difference between these two eras – the wildcatters of the oil era took huge risks with either their own capital or investor capital, whereas the modern-day wildcatters exemplified by the likes of Cambridge Analytica are putting at risk data capital that they don’t own.","Many startups and baby corns, fuelled by an abundance of venture funding are increasingly resorting to a strategy of identifying new data-driven business models that are dependent upon exploiting data from public sources. And this is where, they are not hesitating to cross the thin line between legal and illegal as well as what is ethical and moral. Let’s consider some examples:","Using advanced data analytics to mine user data and derive unique insights into buying patterns, preferences, and a host of other relevant data points that could influence consumer behaviour. Unicorns such as Netflix and Amazon have pioneered this into a science and achieved tremendous financial success.","Contextual advertising, which is increasingly becoming the primary revenue stream for many businesses that have significant user volume. Google and facebook can be considered as prime examples, even though both have multiple revenue streams.","Even though there is no unanimity, the practices cited above are largely considered not only legal, but also ethical to a large extent.","Policy makers recognized a century ago that there is a need to balance genuine entrepreneurship with the need for regulation. This realization gave rise an era of stringent regulation, which laid the foundation for consumer safety, consumer rights, worker protection, and investor rights across diverse domains including oil, banking, airlines, and a host of other industries.","In a similar manner, what we are currently witnessing is to some extent unchartered territory of a data-driven world, that is evolving at exponential speed. While recognizing the genuine need for innovation, we must be proactive in regulating genuine usage of data, and draw the right balance between privacy and individual rights, and clearly define what is legal, ethical, and moral.","In the mad race to become the next digital unicorn, there is a real danger that, in the absence of appropriate regulation, we will end creating an environment conducive for an unregulated monopoly such as the next Standard Oil.","Every action has a consequence","Mark Zuckerberg wants facebook to be the Internet. He may have wanted to make the world a better place for all. As a side effect his net worth might also grow. Facebook is not just a social networking application anymore, it is a platform where commerce can take place, knowledge resides, analytics can be built and thanks to exploitation of data, human behavior can be influenced.","There are many apps on facebook today whose revenue model is based on data rather than on offering something unique to consumers. A consumer purchases merchandise and leaves a data trail along with the monetary transaction, which unwittingly becomes an opportunity for another business transaction? Funny isn’t it? Do we call this being opportunistic or exploitation?","facebook is not alone. Connecting professionals of this world, LinkedIn offers deeper insights into their profiles for recruiters and sales people. Most of us pay hefty subscription fee for this access and insights. So effectively, users are offered free usage of the platform so that Linkedin can profit by selling their information to businesses. Twitter provides targeted feeds that businesses can buy based on demographic data. The difference is that facebook allows third-party apps to be built on its platform, thereby creating a wider exposure of its user information, while other apps are doing it themselves.","What happens if the user base moves towards private networks, access is restricted to moderation, commerce is limited to the members alone, and targeted ads are forbidden?","Making everything public is a sign of transparency, but using the same information to exploit those who generate the information will only make people shy away from making things public and being transparent.","What if people choose to follow Elon Musk’s lead, and quit en masse from facebook?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I'm going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

In the end, it all comes down to what is tracked and what can be deduced from that.","Limitless data storage period","I created my account Friday, September 14, 2007, at 10:59 am and all my actions have been recorded ever since. I feel that for the first time in history, 10 years of consistent human behavior have been meticulously gathered, stored & analyzed.","Exhaustive photo metadata","Whenever you post a photo to Facebook, it keeps a record of all the data that’s attached to it. That seems quite obvious but I didn’t suspect it was so detailed. Have a look:Camera Maker, Model, Orientation, Exposure, F-Stop, ISO Speed, Focal Length, Latitude, Longitude & Upload IP Address","Abundant log-in & session data points","Every time you open Facebook, the time, location, IP address, browser & device have been recorded.

Well, every time you tag a photo, you’re adding to an enormous, user-drivenwealth of knowledge and data.

Facebook allegedlysaidthat its image recognition models could recognize human faceswith98% accuracy& that it could identify a person inone picture out of 800 millionin less than five seconds.","Detailed contact list","When you install Facebook’s app on your phone, you give it the right to see your contact list. Once that’s done, Facebook keeps ALL your contacts information forever.","There’s no sneaky move here: the opt-in process on your phone is actually pretty clear about that.

Despitenumerous requestsby users throughout the world, their response is systematical:","Advertisers do not give Facebook any users’ contact details. We only get such details in hashed form and they are, in any event, deleted within 48 hours. We are therefore not able to confirm what contact information an advertiser has for a particular user.","So Facebook has a lot of data about you & it shares it with a lot of advertisers: but why should you care?","“Bring the world closer…”","… to ads.","I used to think there was no real drawback in ceding a lot of personal data to a 3rd party.

Lovink says social media platforms such as Diaspora seem to offer an alternative. The approach is based on networking individuals around interests, rather than Facebook’s massive friend lists, and data is not sucked up to private clouds.

He lightly tapped a Swiss Army knife on his desk and continued.","“Look, fundamentally the more you know about someone, the better you can communicate with them at a human level, or a mass-communication-advertising level.”","Nix knows a lot, about a lot of people.","Some time in 2014, his company Cambridge Analytica secretly collected data from tens of millions of Facebook users, and used it to persuade many of them to vote for Donald Trump as President, according to multiple reports over the weekend citing an ex-contractor.","In it, he explained in vague, sometimes evasive terms about how his company honed its data-driven marketing technology on Ted Cruz’s primary campaign, and then conducted \"attitudinal surveys\" across the United States to help Trump win the election.","Nix was trim and wore a dark-blue vest and black-and-gold tie. He had thick, black-rimmed spectacles and dirty-blonde, wavy hair that he occasionally smoothed over with his hand.","He had the air of a busy executive, typing on his MacBook while occasionally answering questions. He would often start his answers with a defensive-sounding, “look.”","When asked about where the company’s headquarters were and that of its parent company, SLC, he mumbled that journalists were “coming in here with their suppositions,” then added, curtly, “It’s an affiliate.”","For the head of one of the most notorious data analytics firms in the world, Nix worked from a modest office. Dark smudges lined the wall behind him, and the old MacBook he was typing on had smudges on its lid. A yellow sticky note on his office phone had the words “Bannon” and “Lobbying” scrawled across it, each underlined.","Papers were arranged neatly on his desk, including a letter from House & Garden magazine, while a copy of Time with Donald Trump on the cover was the only overt reference to Nix’s most famous client.","Trump didn’t pay very much for Cambridge Analytica’s services when he hired them, Nix admitted, adding, “He’s a good businessman.”","What Nix didn’t say during his tense interview with Forbes, and what has transpired over the weekend from reports in The Observer and The New York Times, is that Cambridge Analytica had siphoned profile data from more than 50 million users of Facebook, in most cases without their knowledge, ahead of its work on Trump’s campaign.","The company did this by posting a survey app on Facebook called MyDigitalLife,” in 2014. Billed as a “research app used by psychologists” and designed by a Cambridge academic, it promised to help users better understand their own personalities.","Around 270,000 people downloaded MyDigitalLife, giving Cambridge Analytica a backdoor to their data and that of all their friends, more than 50 million other people who, according to Facebook, “had their privacy settings set to allow it.”","A former contractor with Cambridge Analytica revealed how the data mining worked to The Observer and New York Times: “With their profiles, likes, even private messages, [Cambridge Analytica] could build a personality profile on each person and know how best to target them with messages,” said the former contractor, Christopher Wylie in a video interview with The Guardian.","“What you’re susceptible to, and how many times we need to touch you with that to change your mind on something,” Wylie explained. “We created content, websites and blogs. Then they see that and they click it and they go down the rabbit hole. It’s how they start to think differently.”","Such details from Wylie now cast a new and uncomfortable light on Cambridge Analytica’s methods. Facebook says that in 2015 it told the firm to destroy the user data it had secretly scraped.","When Nix spoke to Forbes he took issue with reports that his firm used a method called psychographic profiling to target American voters. “This was not a campaign that was driven by psychographics and certainly not used in the creative engagement,” he said.","“We didn’t do Brexit,” he answered, while moving to type something into his MacBook again. He then leaned back in his office chair. “We didn’t get money for it. We didn’t do work for it. We didn’t sign a contract.”","Nix became most animated when complaining about his company's sullied reputation, and how Trump’s victory should have vindicated its work.","“None of the vendors wanted to work with Trump,” he said, referring to other analytics firms for political campaigns that, he suggested, were regularly giving kickbacks to politicians. “We have wealthy investors, so we don’t need to take bribes,” he added, referring to his firm’s primary backer, hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer.","What was his reaction to criticisms that his methods didn’t even work? “Look.” Nix sighed. “Success has many fathers and failure is an orphan. It’s very difficult for too many people to claim credit on the Trump campaign because there weren’t too many people involved. When we joined the Trump campaign, there were 30 people in Trump Tower. Hillary had about 800 working for her.”","Despite the company’s success, it’s reputation had suffered. “Trump became the villain,\" he said, \"so now we’re the villain.”","Nix went on to boast about the data science credentials of his team, saying that only four of his workforce of 200 were “creatives.” “Everyone has got a masters and PhD’s,” he said. “My PA has got a masters.”","During a brief tour of the company’s open-plan office, Nix showed off two of his data scientists, who sat side-by-side in the company’s open-plan office gazing at vertically-tipped screens. One had been on the company's front-line profiling team in Austin, Texas and during the night of the Presidential election, was busy feeding the system information about how the American electorate were voting.","Beside them, a white board was filled with mathematical formulas while a poster bearing the Trump / Pence logo hung on the other wall. It was filled with signatures of people from the Trump campaign team, and balanced on top was a small American flag. Pressed into another corner was a old, wooden foosball table. The overall impression was that this was not a particularly enjoyable look place to work.","Back in his office, Nix was asked about Trump's campaign strategist, Steve Bannon. Had Bannon been a board member of Cambridge Analytica? Nix nodded. “I talked to him everyday for five years,” he said, without elaborating.","Nix, whose regularly unguarded comments got him featured in a British television news expose on Monday that touched on bribes and sex workers, had quickly segued to an anecdote: “Last night I was at a dinner with some people who own newspapers,” he said, “They were saying why they didn’t like Steve Bannon. I said, ‘Have you met him?’ They said, 'No.' Well then!”","For Nix, it was hard not to take criticism personally, but he admitted this was part of the win-lose job of working on political campaigns.","“If you help one candidate win, you’re going to piss the other one off,” he said. “You’re going to to piss a lot of people off.”","Today’s criticisms have little to do with who Nix helped bring into the White House, though, and everything to do with how it mined voter data.","That's an issue that goes beyond politics, and one that will likely haunt Nix for some time to come.","I cover developments in AI, robotics, chatbots, digital assistants and emerging tech in Europe.

Here's what investigators will ask — Quartz","text":["Facebook is being investigated by the FTC. Here’s what it will ask","The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) today confirmed media reports that it is investigating Facebook, and whether the company violated a 2011 agreement over how it shares its users’ data.","If the FTC determines Facebook infringed that agreement through its recent scandal connected to the actions of the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, it could theoretically trigger hefty fines. Since the news first broke, Facebook has lost billions in stock value.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” said Tom Pahl, the acting director of the commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises…Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”","“There’s plenty of money on the table to make Facebook nervous and get the FTC interested,” says Eric Goldman, the co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law. Facebook’s user data is key to its success; it’s what advertisers use to target Facebook ads.","“What needs to happen is a very thorough investigation and a public airing of the way these platforms function,” said Raj Goyle, a former Kansas state legislator and Congressional candidate, who now is the co-CEO of legal tech platform Bodhala.","What happened in 2011?","The FTC claimed (pdf) in 2011 that Facebook had engaged in “unfair and deceptive practices” by making public the data that its users considered to be private. That claim included the charge that Facebook had inappropriately shared data with advertisers and outside application developers. Developers now say that Facebook was often lax (paywall) about how it shared user data with them and how they could use it.","The social media giant opted to sign a “consent decree” with the FTC, agreeing to not share its users’ data without their consent. It paid no fines.","In 2011, Jessica Rich was serving as the deputy director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, where she helped oversee the consent decree and the drawing up of the order. She is now the vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. In a recent conversation with Quartz, Rich described what she considers the three main areas that investigators will examine to determine whether Facebook violated its agreement.","What happened to the privacy program?","Facebook agreed as part of its settlement to establish and maintain “a comprehensive privacy program” that would address privacy risks and protect people’s information. It also agreed to use an independent third-party professional to audit that program. It’s not clear what this auditor did or did not do.","“I think there would be a strong concern that Facebook’s failure to oversee third-party access to user data fell short of these requirements,” Rich said.","Was the data Facebook’s responsibility?","The agreement requires Facebook not misrepresent to users the extent to which their data will be used.","“In the course of all this, I think the FTC will be looking at whether Facebook made any deceptive statements about third-party access to user data and the oversight of the third parties that Facebook provided,” Rich said.","This is part of a larger and more existential legal question. Facebook permitted Kogan access to user data, but whether the company was responsible for its user data once he passed it along to Cambridge Analytica is an open question.","“That could be a hotter spot for Facebook,” said Goldman of Santa Clara. “We have to look and see exactly what Facebook told users. If it was silent—if Facebook didn’t promise one way or the other—it’s not entirely clear whether Facebook would have default responsibility.”","What did people expect?","The last major question has to do with a user’s expectation when completing their privacy settings.","“When people agree to the settings, would they have anticipated that Facebook would fail to monitor third party access to their data, and fail to enforce its own policies?” Rich asks.","If the answer is no, that opens up a lot of uncomfortable questions for the social media giant to answer.","What’s at stake?","If it is determined the company violated the terms of its agreement with the FTC, it would be subject to hefty fines of $40,000 per incident. If 50 million users had their data shipped off to Cambridge Analytica without their knowing, that could theoretically amount to billions of dollars in fines.","Whether such a large fine would damage user trust in the company isn’t clear. Goldman believes it’s unlikely. “Facebook has broken consumer trust many times, that’s nothing new,” he said. “And remarkably, the string of disappointments by Facebook hasn’t receded its number of users and, until recently, hasn’t reduced its usage.”","Internet technology has developed faster than state and federal privacy laws, effectively putting Silicon Valley in charge of how the data it collects from its customers is used. The Obama administration, which also used social media ad targeting in its campaigns, “certainly was not at the top of its game getting ahead of these issues,” said Goyle, who noted he is a Democrat. The last administration’s “cozy relationship” with the tech industry was hardly ideal, he said.","If Congressional lawmakers aren’t willing to simply trust that companies such as Facebook will adequately protect people’s data, they could pass legislation to establish new rules. Passing that kind of sweeping legislation in the current political climate is unlikely, but Democrats and Republicans in Congress are openly suggesting greater regulation might be necessary.","“They just can’t say ‘trust us’ anymore,” Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said in an interview on National Public Radio. “We’re going to find out if there’s any meat on the bones.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

(Loic Venance / AFP/Getty Images)","Ally MarottiChicago Tribune","Facebook users have been pouring personal data into the social media platform for more than a decade, often without realizing what they were giving up.","When third-party games or quizzes came along, users jumped on board with those too. Many of them were free, but what some users didn’t realize — or didn’t care about — was that they were paying with their personal data.","Now, concerns about sharing every aspect of life on social media are coming to a head amid reports that a political consulting firm hired by President Donald Trump’s campaign allegedly used ill-gotten Facebook data in an effort to influence voter behavior. Users are weighing whether to quit the social media platform and calling for greater online privacy protection.","But experts say those concerns won’t be enough to change the behavior of the masses. Social media have become ubiquitous, and many users are either ambivalent toward data privacy or don’t understand what they’ve given up by agreeing to the terms of service in order to create an account.","Legislation that holds tech companies accountable or offers more transparency regarding data use could help, experts say, but it has proved difficult to pass in the U.S. People also could swear off social media, change their privacy settings or just share less. But for many users, even grave concerns about giving up privacy are trumped by the desire and need to take part in the social media world.","“We’re at a point of time in society … that privacy is almost an afterthought,” said Louis McHugh, director of information technology at Illinois Institute of Technology’s School of Applied Technology. “We really don’t take (it) into account.”","David Paul Morris / Bloomberg","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologized for for a \"major breach of trust,\" and outlined steps to protect user data in light of a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining firm. Facebook has a \"responsibility\" to protect its users' data, he said.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologized for for a \"major breach of trust,\" and outlined steps to protect user data in light of a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining firm. Facebook has a \"responsibility\" to protect its users' data, he said. (David Paul Morris / Bloomberg)","Users who do consider the risk often don’t find it great enough to outweigh the benefits they get from interacting on social media. They are searching for a happy medium: How can they participate in the online world without sacrificing their privacy to the point they’re uncomfortable?","For the past decade or more, users have had that happy medium, said Kent Grayson, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. They were either blissfully ignorant of how tech companies were using their data or were fine with it. Maybe they liked the targeted ads for men’s gift ideas that came just days before their brother’s birthday or discovered a new artist because of a recommendation on a similar song.","For some, having a robust social media presence is a professional necessity. Seven out of 10 employers use social media to screen candidates before hiring, according to a survey conducted in early 2017 on behalf of CareerBuilder.","Even news that people’s personal data could have been used in an attempt to manipulate a presidential election likely won’t be enough for most users to change their behavior, Grayson said. Even if it is, there’s not much they can do about the information that’s already out there.","“If you’ve already been sharing information about yourself, the genie’s out of the bottle,” he said. “It’s impossible, I think, to get it back.”","But there are a few things users can do going forward, said Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder of Chicago-based cybersecurity firm Keeper Security. People need to know the risks of sharing their information on social media, and that starts with actually reading the terms of service, he said.","“If you don’t agree with it, then click ‘I don’t accept,’” he said.","Almost every app has privacy policies and controls, Facebook included, Guccione said. He suggested tinkering with those settings and limiting what the public sees. Facebook users also can control what kind of information the social media giant knows about them by managing their ad preferences.","Using social media credentials to log in to other sites also opens users up to privacy breaches by way of stolen passwords, Guccione said. Additionally, users should know that if they go to a website from inside an application — such as by clicking on a link on Facebook — that application could still be tracking them.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised in a post Wednesday that the social media company would do more to protect its users’ data. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” he wrote.","Zuckerberg’s post came following public outcry in response to a report last weekend from The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by the Trump campaign, gained access to private information of more than 50 million Facebook users, including their profiles, locations and what they like. The firm claimed its tools could analyze voters’ personalities and influence their behavior with targeted messages.","Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired the information, Facebook has said, but it wasn’t stolen. Users allowed the maker of a personality quiz app to take the data. About 270,000 people took the quiz several years ago, the Times reported, and the app-maker was able to scrape data from their Facebook friends. He then provided the data to Cambridge Analytica.","The firm, a U.S. subsidiary of U.K.-based SCL Group, has denied any wrongdoing and on Tuesday suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix. The app developer, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan, told the BBC this week that he didn’t know the data would be used for Trump’s election campaign and that Cambridge Analytica is using him as a scapegoat.","Zuckerberg said in his post that a change Facebook made in 2014 prevents “bad actors” from accessing people’s information and that the company is taking steps to make sure all the data in question is deleted. Additionally, Facebook plans to investigate companies that had access to large amounts of data before 2014, restrict developers’ data access further, and make sure users understand which apps can access their data.","Since the report last weekend, several American and British lawmakers have called for greater privacy protection and asked Zuckerberg to explain what the company knew about the misuse of its data. In Congress, the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday formally requested that Zuckerberg testify about the matter.","The debate over internet privacy legislation in the U.S. has shifted from the federal to state level in recent years, but proponents argue there aren’t enough laws at either level to adequately protect users.","Consumer privacy is not protected under our current legal system, nor do technology companies function in a way that protects it, said Christopher Dore, a partner at Chicago law firm Edelson, which has brought privacy suits against tech companies, including Facebook, Google and Netflix.","Companies lean on the terms of service that customers sign before using their platforms, but there’s no way for a customer to know from that fine print how their data actually will be used, Dore said. There need to be more legal protections in place at the state and federal levels to encourage companies to protect their users’ privacy, he said.","“It can never be a fair transaction if consumers aren’t getting the full story, if they’re not having all the implications of their decision disclosed to them,” Dore said. “That’s the world that we’re currently living in.”","There are some protections in place in Illinois. The state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act, for example, is considered the strictest law of its kind in the nation. The 2008 law mandates that companies collecting biometric information, which includes facial, fingerprint and iris scans, obtain prior consent from consumers, detailing how they’ll use it and how long it will be kept.","That law also allows private citizens to sue, and Illinois has become a hotbed of legal activity surrounding uses of the increasingly popular technology.","Other privacy bills, though, haven’t become law.","Last year, the proposed Right to Know Act, which would require online companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon to disclose to consumers what personal data they are collecting and sharing, made headway in the legislature. However, the measure has been stalled for almost a year.","Separately, Gov. Bruce Rauner in September vetoed a bill meant to protect people from having their location information tracked by companies.","There need to be more protections, in the form of both legislation and technology, said Matthew Erickson, the director of client services and technologies at SpiderOak. The software development and consulting company, based in the Kansas City area, focuses on data security.","It’s not just the tech behemoths that are focused on data collection. Startups are increasingly building their businesses around it. There needs to be a larger discussion in the startup community around protecting users’ data, Erickson said.","“Hopefully, this mass collection of data will be seen as the liability that it actually is,” he said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

Cambridge Analytica is run by Rebekah Mercer, who with her father provided major cash infusions for Trump and groups supporting him during the 2016 campaign. Mercer is also a board member of the Heritage Foundation, the nation’s flagship conservative think tank.","But the alliance also reflects a new reality within the broader conservative universe. Trump didn’t just bring an idiosyncratic set of political priorities with him to Washington. He brought a massive amount of first-time voters and supporters as well—individuals that establishment institutions like Heritage would want to mine for dollars.","Heritage had used Cambridge Analytica’s services before. From late 2015 through June 2016, the firm provided “statistical models to identify new donors” and developed digital ads for the group, according to documents Heritage filed with New York regulators.","But on November 28, 2016, it hammered out a new agreement to use the massive amounts of data that the firm had collected on Trump supporters in the run-up to the election, with an explicit eye towards raising money from the president’s base.","“Cambridge Analytica will provide data and data analytics to inform a data-driven fundraising project for [Heritage] among the Trump supporter audience to enable Client to expand its donor base in light of the November 2016 election results,” reads the business agreement filed by Cambridge Analytica with the government of North Carolina this year. “Cambridge Analytica will leverage proprietary predictive models for a) Trump supporters and b) political issues prioritization c) evangelical and conservative audiences to establish a target audience for Client's fundraising efforts.”","Heritage already has a formidable fundraising operation, having brought in nearly $80 million in donations last year. The new pool of Trump voters, and the shifting center of gravity on the political right, has presented it with challenges and opportunities.","As a candidate, and more recently as a president, Trump has broken with longstanding conservative orthodoxy, in ways that Heritage finds problematic. Three days after Heritage inked its initial Cambridge Analytica fundraising agreement, for instance, Jim DeMint, then the group’s president, appeared on CNN to denounce Donald Trump’s proposed Muslim immigration ban. Heritage’s advocacy arm was also critical of a recent budget deal negotiated between Trump and leading congressional Democrats.","But Trump’s base of support remains largely intact. And there is a premium for politically-active conservative organizations to be able to reach them.","Cambridge Analytica’s massive database of information on Trump voters is the guidebook for doing just that. And it didn’t hurt that the Mercers are major Heritage Foundation donors. Their family foundation has given Heritage at least $1.5 million since 2013.","According to Heritage’s annual tax filing for 2016, the group paid Cambridge Analytica $120,000 last year for its services, which it itemized as a “contract for data analytics.” Though that transaction did not meet the dollar threshold generally required for disclosure of contractor payments, Heritage was required to note it on that filing due to Mercer’s seat on the group’s board.","In an emailed statement, Heritage spokesperson Sarah Mills said the group requires its board members to recuse themselves from any decisions that might impact their own financial bottom lines.","“Regardless of who is occupying the White House, we are always innovating to expand our base of supporters,” Mills said of Heritage’s worlk with Cambridge Analytica. “That requires trying and employing new techniques and technologies.","According to the contract filed in North Carolina, Cambridge Analytic will cross reference its voter data with lists of existing Heritage donors to ensure it is only providing new fundraising prospects. Cambridge Analytica estimated that it could provide Heritage with the names of 600,000 new potential donors.","Cambridge Analytica collects data far beyond the political leanings of the individuals in its database. It also gathers large amounts of more mundane information, such as consumer preferences and health concerns. The firm boasts more than 5,000 data points about each of the voters in its database.","But Heritage will gain access to only a few of them. According to its Cambridge Analytica contract, the firm will provide the names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of its fundraising prospects. It will also give a rundown of their priority policy issues, and “flags on predicted political/religious characteristics.”","Heritage may use that information to inform digital, telemarketing, and door-to-door fundraising efforts, according to the agreement. Cambridge Analytica will charge the group $50 per 1,000 individuals contacted through the data it provides.","Full disclosure: the author of this piece worked at the Heritage Foundation from 2011 to 2013."],"isopubdate":"2017-09-29"}

Around 270,000 people agreed to take the test, but Facebook's terms of service and API at the time allowed the firm to also collect the data of the participants' friends - or the information of more than 50 million people.","The company's shares closed down nearly 7.0 percent on Monday, wiping nearly US$40 billion off its market value following the revelation.","Cambridge Analytica said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data.","The scrutiny presents a fresh threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway US voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","\"We do have some concerns,” said Ron Bates, portfolio manager on the US$131 million 1919 Socially Responsive Balanced Fund, a Facebook shareholder.","“The big issue of the day around customer incidents and data is something that has been discussed among ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) investors for some time and has been a concern.”","Bates said he was encouraged by the fact that the company has acknowledged the privacy issues and was responding, and thinks it remains an appropriate investment for now.","Facebook on Monday said it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, and the company had agreed to comply and give the forensics firm complete access to their servers and systems.","“What would be a deal-breaker for us would be if we saw this recurring and we saw significant risk to the consumer around privacy,” Bates said.","New York City comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees US$193 billion in city pension fund assets, on Monday said that “as investors in Facebook, we’re closely following what are very alarming reports\".","Sustainalytics BV, a widely used research service that rates companies on their ESG performance for investors, said it was reviewing its Facebook rating, which is currently “average.”","“We’re definitely taking a look at it to see if there should be some change,” said Matthew Barg, research manager at Sustainalytics.","“Their business model is so closely tied to having access to consumer data and building off that access. You want to see that they understand that and care about that.”","Wall Street investors, including ESG funds, have ridden the tech sector to record highs in recent months, betting on further outsized returns from stocks including Facebook, Apple and Google parent Alphabet.","Jennifer Sireklove, director of responsible investing at Parametric, a money manager with US$200 billion in assets, said an increasing number of ethics-focused investors were avoiding Facebook and other social media companies, even before the most recent reports about privacy breaches.","“More investors are starting to question whether these companies are contributing to a fair and well-informed public marketplace, or are we becoming all the more fragmented because of the ways in which these companies are operating,” she said.","New EU privacy rules","Facebook is also facing substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May.","Privacy experts said the data harvesting scandal was a prime example of the kinds of practices the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.","The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.","Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it “would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue”, said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems.","Because a UK company (Cambridge Analytica) was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, the GDPR would have applied.","Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.","“The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn’t adequately monitoring what third parties were doing,” said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.","Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.","Facebook on Monday said it changed its policies in 2015 to “to give much less data, especially about friends\".","“We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,” the company said.","“We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”","Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook’s overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.","The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.","“If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,” Deutsche Bank warned.","The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.","GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans’ consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.","Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.","“There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,” she said.","Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.","For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.","The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.","Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented “in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language\".","In other words, the days of extensive “terms of service” agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, according to privacy lawyers.","In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more “permissions screens” and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.","That could depress usage, Facebook CFO David Wehner said at an investor conference last month.","“Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there’s some potential that people decide they’re not going to use the product,” Wehner said.","\"We don’t think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.”","All rights reserved.

He said that the so-called psychography profiles combined Facebook data with information gathered from other \"top commercial data providers\" and that data included specific information about voter \"demographics, geographics, purchase history, and interests.\"","When a Facebook user engaged with the survey, he said, the user implicitly gave the company access to a broad spectrum of personal data that Facebook provides for advertisers. The app reached further, giving the company access to profile data from people in the users' broader circle of Facebook friends who had, wittingly or otherwise, set their security setting relatively weakly. Though the company likely did not use a traditional \"hack\" to access user information, they may have violated Facebook's terms of use by bulk harvesting and repurposing user data.","When asked about how the company chose what to include in Facebook surveys, Oczkowski would only say that, it collects data from \"exclusive relationships\" with data vendors \"and through direct response projects.\"","Cambridge Analytica pushed back Saturday against the notion that it harvested any data, insisting it had contracted a firm in the U.K. to do research. Cambridge Analytica insisted that when it learned that it had been sold data it shouldn't have, the firm deleted the data.","Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data. 1/8","\"Inner Demons\"","Getting users to interact with the survey was key to unlocking the data. A source close to the 2016 Trump campaign and familiar with Cambridge Analytica's tactics explained that the surveys used by the company used inflammatory language designed to provoke the \"worst tendencies\" in Facebook users -- meaning that it would stir up the kind of emotion that would prompt an interaction. Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the campaign. Mr. Trump's 2016 digital guru, Brad Parscale, told \"60 Minutes\" last year that the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's controversial practice of psychographics.","Cambridge Analytica specializes in psychographics, which microtargets ads based on personality. In the words of whistleblower Christopher Wylie: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons.\"","That allowed the company to scale up their data gathering rapidly. Wired reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday that by convincing 270,000 people to interact with the app, GSR managed to tap into the data of over 50 million users.","CEO Alexander Nix described the firm as \"fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" and even tweeted Saturday that President Obama's 2012 \"pioneered microtargeting.\"","But Oczkowski contradicted that assertion, and explained that \"we served as the data agency of record, but our role quickly evolved as the cycle progressed.\"","The company developed \"three pillars\" of exclusive technology, Oczkowski said, including data science and analytics, digital marketing designed for persuasion and get-out-the-vote (GOTV), and polling research. \"Having a large amount of control and input into each of these three areas allowed us to be extremely efficient and reactive,\" he said. \"It also allowed us to easily integrate with the staff at Giles-Parscale and the RNC.\"","When asked specifically how the company leveraged Facebook for other data, Oczkowski explained that the company's data analytics prowess assisted the Trump campaign for everything from resource allocation, calculating the most efficient candidate travel stops, advertising, and the language used in surrogate speeches, and even \"personalizing messaging to the individual voter.\"","\"Huge exaggeration\"","Within GOP data circles, however, the company's extravagant claims about the effectiveness of Facebook data and artificial intelligence are heavily criticized. \"I'm not saying they lied,\" said a former Trumpworld staffer shortly after the election, \"but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration. Data can do a lot of things, but there's a limit to how effective it is. Cambridge Analytica's claims went far beyond that limit.\"","Cambridge Analytica is not alone in their use of Facebook and social media to target consumers with advertising. Machine learning is one of the fastest growing sectors of business technology, and a number of firms have adopted similar tactics. Amazon, Google, Twitter, and a host of other cloud-based Internet giants are hiring AI experts and building algorithms that automate advertising.","It's no surprise that cloud giants are actively using big data analysis models to aid private industry in everything from cybersecurity to marketing.

Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know.

The company then used that data to try and influence the 2016 presidential election. At this point, the U.K.'s information commissioner is seeking a warrant to look at Cambridge Analytica's databases and servers. Rebecca MacKinnon is with us now. She's the director of Ranking Digital Rights. It's a nonprofit that ranks companies based on how well they protect users' data. Rebecca, thanks for coming in.","REBECCA MACKINNON: Thanks so much for having me.","KING: So the easy question here is, does Facebook have a problem protecting our personal information?","MACKINNON: Well, they certainly have a problem informing us about what they're collecting, who they're sharing it with and what's happening to that information. And in our ranking of Internet companies overall, I mean, basically the whole industry is not doing well on this.","KING: OK.","MACKINNON: But we looked at a couple of questions around, does the company clearly disclose to users what options they have to control, what data of theirs is retained and used and shared? And Facebook provided less disclosure. I mean, you know, you're clicking on these privacy policies, and Facebook says, well, you know, we had people's consent. But even if you read the policy - and I have the whole team that's reading these policies - Facebook has provided less disclosure and fewer options for controlling what gets shared than any other Internet platform that we examined...","MACKINNON: So they disclose a minimal amount of information about what you can do to control your information, particularly when it comes to sharing with targeted advertising. And in terms of...","KING: Let me ask you about that. The data that Cambridge Analytica collected was used to target audiences with digital ads. Isn't it pretty common for Facebook to allow third parties to collect user data?","MACKINNON: Right. Well, this is part of the business model.","KING: OK.","MACKINNON: But the issue is, what's getting disclosed to users? Do we have any idea about what's happening? And not just users, but, do regulators understand what's going on? Do journalists actually know what Facebook is sharing with whom under what conditions? This is not shared clearly.","KING: I mean, I could be one of those 50 million people. I'm on Facebook. But I don't know that. Should I? And can I?","MACKINNON: You should. You cannot right now, and that's a problem. And this is one of the other problems, is that we're relying on companies to voluntarily disclose this information for the most part. I mean, privacy law in the United States is very weak. And I think that this latest incident with Cambridge Analytica just shows that we need a comprehensive privacy law and a privacy agency in this country, not just for consumer protection. It's now become really clear that data protection is nothing less than a national security imperative.","KING: Why do you think there hasn't been more outcry among consumers? People don't seem that ticked off, or that furious or that freaked out about this.","MACKINNON: Well, in part, you just don't know what's happening.","KING: If you're one of 50 million.","MACKINNON: Right. And, you know, we've got a real problem, as well. You know, the news today that Facebook's chief security officer, he's having his team disbanded for the investigation.

The revelations that have panicked Facebook executives and spooked its investors started at Cambridge Analytica's offices, the brainchild of now 28-year-old co-founder-turned self-proclaimed-whistleblower Christopher Wylie.","\"All of these pieces of information, put together, create a digital portrait of who you are,\" Wylie said.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Sen. Ted Cruz and President Trump's 2016 campaign. The idea was to put 2016 political advertising on steroids by targeting certain people based on very specific people.","Here's how it happened: In 2014, a company called Global Science Research (GSR) used Facebook to distribute a personality quiz to analyze whether users were extroverted or neurotic. The company said it was doing it just for research purposes, but it actually harvested the psychological data from all the users and -- with their permission -- got access to some data on their Facebook friends.","\"It scaled really quickly. We spent over $1 million on it, so it wasn't cheap but in terms of the amount of data that was collected, and the quality of that data, it was a rare example of where something was fast, relatively cheap, but high-quality, \" Wylie said.","\"I take a share of responsibility in this because I was the research director and I worked on this program so I'm going to start by saying I'm taking responsibility and I'm owning up,\" Wylie said. \"In terms of who else needs to take responsibility: Cambridge Analytica -- it funded the program, it approved the program -- as an entity this is what ultimately became the foundation of what Cambridge Analytica is.\"","Wylie added: \"Last week I offered to help Facebook and work with Facebook and their lawyers confirmed that they wanted to work in a collaborative manner -- when all of this came out I got banned [from Facebook] -- they decided that actually the whistleblower is the person they want to apparently go after.\"","Facebook said the use of the data was unauthorized. Since 2015, the company has banned third-party developers from collecting data on users friends.","But Facebook's critics say the company should have done more. David Carroll, who has filed a lawsuit to figure out exactly what information was used, believes the social media giant should bear some responsibility.","\"If they did let data get collected in an illicit manner and didn't adequately protect it when they learned how it was used, then yes, they are responsible. That's the deal they make with us, that they protect our data in order for us to use the service,\" Carroll said.","The more information a political campaign knows about you, the more they can target ads. They know your personality and they know your interests. They know your religion and how strongly you believe it, and they can target ads against those beliefs.","Users don't need to worry that their personal information will be hacked, or your bank information stolen, but Wylie has said that this information was used to create ads that turned people against each other and they were deliberately divisive."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn't authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook's unusual public explanation of the move wasn't clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company. For the \"avoidance of doubt,\" the spokesman said, none of Kogan's data was used in Cambridge Analytica's 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign.","ADVERTISEMENT","Facebook said it was suspending political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked for President Trump’s 2016 election campaign, after finding data privacy policies had been violated. https://t.co/ZLp7KkVUvS","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Nix said Assange said no. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.

{"originalurl":"http://alistapart.com/article/conversational-design","title":"Conversational Design · An A List Apart Article","text":["In 2015, the Pew Research Center found that 64% of American adults owned a smartphone of some kind, up from 35% in 2011. We still refer to these personal, pocket-sized computers as phones, but “Phone” is now just one of many communication apps we neglect in favor of texting. Texting is the most widely used mobile data service in America. And in the wider world, four billion people have mobile phones, so 4 billion people have access to SMS or other messaging apps. For some, dictating messages into a wristwatch offers an appealing alternative to placing a call.","The popularity of texting can be partially explained by the medium’s ability to offer the easy give-and-take of conversation without requiring continuous attention. Texting feels like direct human connection, made even more captivating by unpredictable lag and irregular breaks. Any typing is incidental because the experience of texting barely resembles “writing,” a term that carries associations of considered composition. In his TED talk, Columbia University linguist John McWhorter called texting “fingered conversation”—terminology I find awkward, but accurate. The physical act—typing—isn’t what defines the form or its conventions. Technology is breaking down our traditional categories of communication.","By the numbers, texting is the most compelling computer-human interaction going. When we text, we become immersed and forget our exchanges are computer-mediated at all. We can learn a lot about digital design from the inescapable draw of these bite-sized interactions, specifically the use of language.","What Texting Teaches Us","This is an interesting example of what makes computer-mediated interaction interesting. The reasons people are compelled to attend to their text messages—even at risk to their own health and safety—aren’t high-production values, so-called rich media, or the complexity of the feature set.","Texting, and other forms of social media, tap into something very primitive in the human brain. These systems offer always-available social connection. The brevity and unpredictability of the messages themselves triggers the release of dopamine that motivates seeking behavior and keeps people coming back for more. What makes interactions interesting may start on a screen, but the really interesting stuff happens in the mind. And language is a critical part of that. Our conscious minds are made of language, so it’s easy to perceive the messages you read not just as words but as the thoughts of another mingled with your own. Loneliness seems impossible with so many voices in your head.","With minimal visual embellishment, texts can deliver personality, pathos, humor, and narrative. This is apparent in “Texts from Dog,” which, as the title indicates, is a series of imagined text exchanges between a man and his dog. (Fig 1.1). With just a few words, and some considered capitalization, Joe Butcher (writing as October Jones) creates a vivid picture of the relationship between a neurotic canine and his weary owner.","Using words is key to connecting with other humans online, just as it is in the so-called “real world.” Imbuing interfaces with the attributes of conversation can be powerful. I’m far from the first person to suggest this. However, as computers mediate more and more relationships, including customer relationships, anyone thinking about digital products and services is in a challenging place. We’re caught between tried-and-true past practices and the urge to adopt the “next big thing,” sometimes at the exclusion of all else.","Being intentionally conversational isn’t easy. This is especially true in business and at scale, such as in digital systems. Professional writers use different types of writing for different purposes, and each has rules that can be learned. The love of language is often fueled by a passion for rules — rules we received in the classroom and revisit in manuals of style, and rules that offer writers the comfort of being correct outside of any specific context. Also, there is the comfort of being finished with a piece of writing and moving on. Conversation, on the other hand, is a context-dependent social activity that implies a potentially terrifying immediacy.","Moving from the idea of publishing content to engaging in conversation can be uncomfortable for businesses and professional writers alike. There are no rules. There is no done. It all feels more personal. Using colloquial language, even in “simplifying” interactive experiences, can conflict with a desire to appear authoritative. Or the pendulum swings to the other extreme and a breezy style gets applied to a laborious process like a thin coat of paint.","As a material for design and an ingredient in interactions, words need to emerge from the content shed and be considered from the start. The way humans use language—easily, joyfully, sometimes painfully—should anchor the foundation of all interactions with digital systems.","The way we use language and the way we socialize are what make us human; our past contains the key to what commands our attention in the present, and what will command it in the future. To understand how we came to be so perplexed by our most human quality, it’s worth taking a quick look at, oh!, the entire known history of communication technology.","The Mother Tongue","Accustomed to eyeballing type, we can forget language began in our mouths as a series of sounds, like the calls and growls of other animals. We’ll never know for sure how long we’ve been talking—speech itself leaves no trace—but we do know it’s been a mighty long time.","Then, a mere 6,000 years ago, ancient Sumerian commodity traders grew tired of getting ripped off. Around 3200 BCE, one of them had the idea to track accounts by scratching wedges in wet clay tablets. Cuneiform was born.","So, don’t feel bad about procrastinating when you need to write—humanity put the whole thing off for a couple hundred thousand years! By a conservative estimate, we’ve had writing for about 4% of the time we’ve been human. Chatting is easy; writing is an arduous chore.","Prior to mechanical reproduction, literacy was limited to the elite by the time and cost of hand-copying manuscripts. It was the rise of printing that led to widespread literacy; mass distribution of text allowed information and revolutionary ideas to circulate across borders and class divisions. The sharp increase in literacy bolstered an emerging middle class. And the ability to record and share knowledge accelerated all other advances in technology: photography, radio, TV, computers, internet, and now the mobile web. And our talking speakers.","Fig 1.2: In hindsight, “literate culture” now seems like an annoying phase we had to go through so we could get to texting.","Every time our communication technology advances and changes, so does the surrounding culture—then it disrupts the power structure and upsets the people in charge. Catholic archbishops railed against mechanical movable type in the fifteenth century. Today, English teachers deplore texting emoji. Resistance is, as always, futile. OMG is now listed in the Oxford English Dictionary.","But while these developments have changed the world and how we relate to one another, they haven’t altered our deep oral core.","Orality, Say It with Me","Orality knits persons into community.","Walter Ong","Today, when we record everything in all media without much thought, it’s almost impossible to conceive of a world in which the sum of our culture existed only as thoughts.","Before literacy, words were ephemeral and all knowledge was social and communal. There was no “save” option and no intellectual property. The only way to sustain an idea was to share it, speaking aloud to another person in a way that made it easy for them to remember. This was orality—the first interface.","We can never know for certain what purely oral cultures were like. People without writing are terrible at keeping records. But we can examine oral traditions that persist for clues.","The oral formula","Reading and writing remained elite activities for centuries after their invention. In cultures without a writing system, oral characteristics persisted to help transmit poetry, history, law and other knowledge across generations.","The epic poems of Homer rely on meter, formulas, and repetition to aid memory:","Far as a man with his eyes sees into the mist of the distance\nSitting aloft on a crag to gaze over the wine-dark seaway,\nJust so far were the loud-neighing steeds of the gods overleaping.","Iliad, 5.770","Concrete images like rosy-fingered dawn, loud-neighing steeds, wine-dark seaway, and swift-footed Achilles served to aid the teller and to sear the story into the listener’s memory.","Biblical proverbs also encode wisdom in a memorable format:","As a dog returns to its vomit, so fools repeat their folly.","Proverbs 26:11","That is vivid.","And a saying that originated in China hundreds of years ago can prove sufficiently durable to adorn a few hundred Etsy items:","The labor of literature","Literacy created distance in time and space and decoupled shared knowledge from social interaction. Human thought escaped the existential present. The reader doesn’t need to be alive at the same time as the writer, let alone hanging out around the same fire pit or agora.","Freed from the constraints of orality, thinkers explored new forms to preserve their thoughts. And what verbose and convoluted forms these could take:","The Reader will I doubt too soon discover that so large an interval of time was not spent in writing this discourse; the very length of it will convince him, that the writer had not time enough to make a shorter.","George Tullie, An Answer to a Discourse Concerning the Celibacy of the Clergy, 1688","There’s no such thing as an oral semicolon. And George Tullie has no way of knowing anything about his future audience. He addresses himself to a generic reader he will never see, nor receive feedback from. Writing in this manner is terrific for precision, but not good at all for interaction.","Writing allowed literate people to become hermits and hoarders, able to record and consume knowledge in total solitude, invest authority in them, and defend ownership of them. Though much writing preserved the dullest of records, the small minority of language communities that made the leap to literacy also gained the ability to compose, revise, and perfect works of magnificent complexity, utility, and beauty.","The qualities of oral culture","In Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word, Walter Ong explored the “psychodynamics of orality,” which is, coincidentally, quite a mouthful. Through his research, he found that the ability to preserve ideas in writing not only increased knowledge, it altered values and behavior. People who grow up and live in a community that has never known writing are different from literate people—they depend upon one another to preserve and share knowledge. This makes for a completely different, and much more intimate, relationship between ideas and communities.","Oral culture is immediate and social","In a society without writing, communication can happen only in the moment and face-to-face. It sounds like the introvert’s nightmare! Oral culture has several other hallmarks as well:","Spoken words are events that exist in time. It’s impossible to step back and examine a spoken word or phrase. While the speaker can try to repeat, there’s no way to capture or replay an utterance.","All knowledge is social, and lives in memory. Formulas and patterns are essential to transmitting and retaining knowledge. When the knowledge stops being interesting to the audience, it stops existing.","Individuals need to be present to exchange knowledge or communicate. All communication is participatory and immediate. The speaker can adjust the message to the context. Conversation, contention, and struggle help to retain this new knowledge.","The community owns knowledge, not individuals. Everyone draws on the same themes, so not only is originality not helpful, it’s nonsensical to claim an idea as your own.","There are no dictionaries or authoritative sources. The right use of a word is determined by how it’s being used right now.","Literate culture promotes authority and ownership","Printed books enabled mass-distribution and dispensed with handicraft of manuscripts, alienating readers from the source of the ideas, and from each other. (Ong pg. 100):","The printed text is an independent physical object. Ideas can be preserved as a thing, completely apart from the thinker.","Portable printed works enable individual consumption. The need and desire for private space accompanied the emergence of silent, solo reading.","Print creates a sense of private ownership of words. Plagiarism is possible.","Individual attribution is possible. The ability to identify a sole author increases the value of originality and creativity.","Print fosters a sense of closure. Once a work is printed, it is final and closed.","Print-based literacy ascended to a position of authority and cultural dominance, but it didn’t eliminate oral culture completely.","Technology brought us together again","All that studying allowed people to accumulate and share knowledge, speeding up the pace of technological change. And technology transformed communication in turn. It took less than 150 years to get from the telegraph to the World Wide Web. And with the web—a technology that requires literacy—Ong identified a return to the values of the earlier oral culture. He called this secondary orality. Then he died in 2003, before the rise of the mobile internet, when things really got interesting.","Secondary orality is:","Immediate. There is no necessary delay between the expression of an idea and its reception. Physical distance is meaningless.","Socially aware and group-minded. The number of people who can hear and see the same thing simultaneously is in the billions.","Conversational. This is in the sense of being both more interactive and less formal.","Collaborative. Communication invites and enables a response, which may then become part of the message.","Intertextual. The products of our culture reflect and influence one another.","Wikipedia: Knowledge Talks","When someone mentions a genre of music you’re unfamiliar with—electroclash, say, or plainsong—what do you do to find out more? It’s quite possible you type the term into Google and end up on Wikipedia, the improbably successful, collaborative encyclopedia that would be absent without the internet.","According to Wikipedia, encyclopedias have existed for around two-thousand years. Wikipedia has existed since 2001, and it’s the fifth most-popular site on the web. Wikipedia is not a publication so much as a society that provides access to knowledge. A volunteer community of “Wikipedians” continuously adds to and improves millions of articles in over 200 languages. It’s a phenomenon manifesting all the values of secondary orality:","Anyone can contribute anonymously and anyone can modify the contributions of another.","The output is free.","The encyclopedia articles are not attributed to any sole creator. A single article might have 2 editors or 1,000.","Each article has an accompanying “talk” page where editors discuss potential improvements, and a “history” page that tracks all revisions. Heated arguments are not documented. They take place as revisions within documents.","Wikipedia is disruptive in the true Clayton Christensen sense. It’s created immense value and wrecked an existing business model. Traditional encyclopedias are publications governed by authority, and created by experts and fact checkers. A volunteer project collaboratively run by unpaid amateurs shows that conversation is more powerful than authority, and that human knowledge is immense and dynamic.","In an interview with The Guardian, a British librarian expressed some disdain about Wikipedia.","The main problem is the lack of authority. With printed publications, the publishers must ensure that their data are reliable, as their livelihood depends on it. But with something like this, all that goes out the window.","Philip Bradley, “Who knows?”, The Guardian, October 26, 2004","Wikipedia is immediate, group-minded, conversational, collaborative, and intertextual— secondary orality in action—but it relies on traditionally published sources for its authority. After all, anything new that changes the world does so by fitting into the world. As we design for new methods of communication, we should remember that nothing is more valuable simply because it’s new; rather, technology is valuable when it brings us more of what’s already meaningful.","From Documents to Events","Pages and documents organize information in space. Space used to be more of a constraint back when we printed conversation out. Now that the internet has given us virtually infinite space, we need to mind how conversation moves through time. Thinking about serving the needs of people in an internet-based culture requires a shift from thinking about how information occupies space—documents—to how it occupies time—events.","Texting means that we’ve never been more lively (yet silent) in our communications. While we still have plenty of in-person interactions, it’s gotten easy to go without. We text grocery requests to our spouses. We click through a menu in a mobile app to summon dinner (the order may still arrive at the restaurant by fax, proving William Gibson’s maxim that the future is unevenly distributed). We exchange messages on Twitter and Facebook instead of visiting friends in person, or even while visiting friends in person. We work at home and Slack our colleagues.","We’re rapidly approaching a future where humans text other humans and only speak aloud to computers. A text-based interaction with a machine that’s standing in for a human should feel like a text-based interaction with a human. Words are a fundamental part of the experience, and they are part of the design. Words should be the basis for defining and creating the design.","We’re participating in a radical cultural transformation. The possibilities manifest in systems like Wikipedia that succeed in changing the world by using technology to connect people in a single collaborative effort. And even those of us creating the change suffer from some lag. The dominant educational and professional culture remains based in literary values. We’ve been rewarded for individual achievement rather than collaboration. We seek to “make our mark,” even when designing changeable systems too complex for any one person to claim authorship. We look for approval from an authority figure. Working in a social, interactive way should feel like the most natural thing in the world, but it will probably take some doing.","Literary writing—any writing that emerges from the culture and standards of literacy—is inherently not interactive. We need to approach the verbal design not as a literary work, but as a conversation. Designing human-centered interactive systems requires us to reflect on our deep-seated orientation around artifacts and ownership. We must alienate ourselves from a set of standards that no longer apply.","Most advice on “writing for the web” or “creating content” starts from the presumption that we are “writing,” just for a different medium. But when we approach communication as an assembly of pieces of content rather than an interaction, customers who might have been expecting a conversation end up feeling like they’ve been handed a manual instead.","Software is on a path to participating in our culture as a peer. So, it should behave like a person—alive and present. It doesn’t matter how much so-called machine intelligence is under the hood—a perceptive set of programmatic responses, rather than a series of documents, can be enough if they have the qualities of conversation.","Interactive systems should evoke the best qualities of living human communities—active, social, simple, and present—not passive, isolated, complex, or closed off.","Life Beyond Literacy","Indeed, language changes lives. It builds society, expresses our highest aspirations, our basest thoughts, our emotions and our philosophies of life. But all language is ultimately at the service of human interaction. Other components of language—things like grammar and stories—are secondary to conversation.","Daniel L. Everett, How Language Began","Literacy has gotten us far. It’s gotten you this far in this book. So, it’s not surprising we’re attached to the idea. Writing has allowed us to create technologies that give us the ability to interact with one another across time and space, and have instantaneous access to knowledge in a way our ancestors would equate with magic. However, creating and exchanging documents, while powerful, is not a good model for lively interaction. Misplaced literate values can lead to misery—working alone and worrying too much about posterity.","So, it’s time to let go and live a little! We’re at an exciting moment. The computer screen that once stood for a page can offer a window into a continuous present that still remembers everything. Or, the screen might disappear completely.","Now we can start imagining, in an open-ended way, what constellation of connected devices any given person will have around them, and how we can deliver a meaningful, memorable experience on any one of them. We can step away from the screen and consider what set of inputs, outputs, events, and information add up to the best experience.","This is daunting for designers, sure, yet phenomenal for people. Thinking about human-computer interactions from a screen-based perspective was never truly human-centered from the start. The ideal interface is an interface that’s not noticeable at all—a world in which the distance from thought to action has collapsed and merely uttering a phrase can make it so.","About the Author","Erika Hall has been working in web design and development since the late 20th century.

But leading lawyers in Washington and New York have repeatedly spurned overtures to take over the defense of Mr. Trump, a mercurial client who often ignores his advisers’ guidance. In some cases, lawyers’ firms have blocked any talks, fearing a backlash that would hurt business.","The president lost two lawyers in just the past four days, including one who had been on board for less than a week.","Joseph diGenova, a longtime Washington lawyer who has pushed theories on Fox News that the F.B.I. made up evidence against Mr. Trump, left the team on Sunday. He had been hired last Monday, three days before the head of the president’s personal legal team, John Dowd, quit after determining that the president was not listening to his advice. Mr. Trump had also considered hiring Mr. diGenova’s wife, Victoria Toensing, but she will also not join the team.","That leaves the president with just one personal lawyer who is working full time on the special counsel’s investigation as Mr. Trump is facing one of the most significant decisions related to it: whether to sit for an interview.","That lawyer, Jay Sekulow, is a conservative commentator who made his name on religious freedom cases. Mr. Sekulow is in talks with other lawyers about joining the team, although it is not clear how far those discussions have progressed.","Hours before the announcement of Mr. diGenova’s departure, which Mr. Sekulow said was related to a conflict of interest, the president took to Twitter to reject any suggestion that lawyers do not want to work for him.","“Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case … don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on,” he wrote. “Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted.”","Adding new lawyers, he said, would be costly because they would take months “to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more).”","“I am very happy with my existing team,” he added.","This month, the president met with the veteran lawyer Emmet Flood about the possibility of joining the legal team. But Mr. Trump was put off by the fact that Mr. Flood, a Republican, had represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment process, and Mr. Flood has made clear that he will not represent the president if Marc E. Kasowitz, his brash longtime personal lawyer, has any role in the effort.","Mr. Trump also tried to recruit Theodore B. Olson, a well-known Republican lawyer, but Mr. Olson has said he would not be representing the president.","The first phase of legal work for Mr. Trump in the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was led by a White House lawyer, Ty Cobb. That work, which in part involved the production of documents and the arrangement of interviews with White House officials, has been largely completed.","The second phase, which is now focused on the question of a presidential interview with Mr. Mueller, had been led by Mr. Dowd. One reason Mr. Dowd quit was that, against his advice, Mr. Trump was insistent that he wanted to answer questions under oath from Mr. Mueller, believing that it would help clear him.","Mr. Dowd had concluded that there was no upside and that the president, who often does not tell the truth, could increase his legal exposure if his answers were not accurate.","Roger Cossack, a seasoned legal analyst, said the key to successfully defending a high-profile client under immense scrutiny was to have a cohesive legal team with a consistent strategy.","Image","John Dowd quit as the head of the president’s personal legal team last week after determining that Mr. Trump was not listening to his advice.CreditBrendan Mcdermid/Reuters","“In these types of cases, you need highly competent lawyers and a client who will listen and follow their advice,” Mr. Cossack said. “If you don’t have both, you have what we’re seeing here: chaos and disaster.”","“You have a client who clearly thinks he has a better idea of how things should work than the lawyers who, from time to time, have told him things he doesn’t want to hear,” he added. “He is looking for the guy who can say, ‘I know how to handle Mueller, I know you think he is bad, and we’ll take care of it.’ Problem is you can’t find that lawyer because no one will be able to do that.”","People close to the president say the upheaval in the legal team was inevitable. When Mr. Kasowitz took the lead after Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, he wanted to follow a model used by Mr. Clinton, with a separate team of lawyers and communications professionals handling issues related to the inquiry, so that the White House staff could keep its distance.","But Mr. Trump, who trusts few people and considers himself his best lawyer, spokesman and strategist, never wanted that type of system. As a result, his legal and public relations strategies have been out of sync, with the president at times publicly contradicting his lawyers, and the White House often finding itself flat-footed in the face of new disclosures about the Russia investigation.","The president’s decision has also exposed many of his aides, leaving them deeply enmeshed in an inquiry that is likely to cost them tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.","But while Mr. Trump has struggled to find lawyers, his family and his close associates are being represented by some of the country’s top legal talent.","His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has hired Abbe Lowell, a longtime Washington lawyer who recently got the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, after a lengthy court fight.","Three prominent current and former White House officials — the former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus; and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn — are being represented by William A. Burck, who turned down the chance to represent the president. Mr. Burck, a former federal prosecutor, represented FIFA in its legal problems in the United States and has worked for high-profile witnesses in federal investigations, including Maureen McDonnell, the wife of a former Virginia governor.","The turmoil in Mr. Trump’s legal team started within weeks of the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Kasowitz pushed for an adversarial approach to the special counsel, which the president was poised to follow. But Mr. Kasowitz clashed with Mr. Kushner, and he was soon pushed aside after a series of missteps and embarrassing incidents.","The president then hired Mr. Cobb, a veteran Washington lawyer, to lead efforts within the White House, as well as Mr. Dowd, who was put in charge of his personal legal team. They advocated a strategy of cooperation, telling the president that the sooner he gave Mr. Mueller’s office what it wanted, the sooner his name would be cleared.","While Mr. Cobb had told the president that the investigation would be over by now, it seems to be accelerating. Mr. Mueller is still looking into a wide range of matters related to Mr. Trump’s corporate activities, his 2016 campaign, his associates and his time in office.","Mr. Trump, hoping to bolster his team, met with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing in recent days but, according to two people told of details about the meeting, did not believe he had personal chemistry with them.","There were also significant conflict-of-interest issues, but Mr. Trump could have waived them if he wanted. Ms. Toensing is representing Mark Corallo, who was the spokesman for Mr. Trump’s legal team in 2017 before they parted ways. Mr. Corallo has told investigators that he was concerned that a close aide to Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, may have been planning to obstruct justice during the drafting of a statement about a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr. during the campaign.","Ms. Hicks’s lawyer has strongly denied that suggestion, and White House aides said Mr. Corallo’s assertion had come up in discussions with the president as he weighed whether to go ahead with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing.","Mr. diGenova had been expected to serve as an outspoken voice for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on Mr. Mueller. Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president, a theory with little supporting evidence.","“There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he had told Fox News in January.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Defense Team For President: Army of One.

Antonie Robertson / The National","Not my problem any more … Sean Spicer doesn’t use these words when we meet in Dubai (to say that would be fake news). But the former White House communications director has reason to be grateful to have moved on to media pastures new.","The whirlwind turnover of staff at the top of Donald Trump’s administration; allegations that the president had a liaison with an adult film star; the ongoing saga of Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia in the 2016 US election campaign; and now the developing story of how data harvesting may have helped to swing the vote. These days, somebody else has the job of explaining it all.","Mr Spicer has other things to brief. He is in the UAE for this week’s Sharjah Government Communications Forum to discuss, among other things, the challenge of government communications in the digital era. And it’s not surprising he was asked to attend.","It was he who would be awoken most mornings during his (brief) tenure with calls from reporters asking for a response to the dawn tweets that have become a feature of the Trump presidency. It was he who had to stand at what became his trademark podium and echo his boss’s insistence that, no, our eyes were deceiving us, that was the biggest crowd ever seen at an inauguration.","“There’s a potential crisis because so much of what goes out snowballs and goes viral and it’s hard to walk it back,” Mr Spicer says. “You find a lot of times that one little rumour becomes the basis for a lot of speculation and reporting real quick.","“Somebody posts something, everyone goes with it like it’s factual, and it’s hard to put the genie back in the bottle.”","But surely the Trump team – then and now – has been guilty of jumping on poorly sourced stories as though they were fact?","“I think it’s a two-way street. There are stories we may have jumped on but also stories the media promulgated that weren’t well sourced. The problem is only looked at in one direction. To folks in the media, I say ‘let’s look at stuff you got wrong’. There has to be honesty on both sides.” The timing of this week’s forum – under the patronage of Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah – could not be better. Coincidentally, Tim Berners-Lee, otherwise known as the founder of the internet, will also be there at what appears to be a pivotal moment for his world wide web and its relationship with government, the news – and the truth.","“The evolution of news has changed dramatically in 10 years, exponentially in 10 months,” Mr Spicer says. “Now there has to be a broader discussion about the balance between a government’s role in the era of social media – what do we regulate, what do we want to do to protect people but also give them the freedom social media has afforded us?","“At some point, somebody becomes the arbiter. If we tell Facebook and Google and Twitter to start policing things, they’ll hire people we don’t know to make those decisions. Are they outsourcing the job to the cheapest source? What’s their degree of accountability?","“We’ll see on Twitter ‘This post is no longer available’. The question is, what did it say? Who decided it had to come down? Was it offensive? Was it false? Who is that umpire? But governments have to realise this is not something they can control.”","And then throw Cambridge Analytica into the mix. The British company stands accused of influencing, with the help of unauthorised personal Facebook data, elections around the world. Most notably, the one Mr Spicer contested.","“We [the Republicans] built a massive data operation,” he says. But he downplays any role played by Cambridge Analytica – “To simplify what happened in the 2016 election to what happened on Facebook would be a mistake” – while he admits there is a wider problem.","“We’ve seen data breaches with credit agencies and government institutions. That’s very concerning,” Mr Spicer says. “We share all this information on social media; who we value, our likes and dislikes.","“What safeguards need to be put in place? Well, we as consumers need to be much more careful about what we put out.”","Mr Spicer, 46, is a fairly infrequent and discreet tweeter. But expect a flurry of words, and perhaps indiscretions, with the publication this summer of his memoir of life in the White House, The Briefing.","You might have thought he would have enjoyed the relative obscurity of the past eight months and the time it has permitted him to spend with his family after those dawn-to-dusk days in the office. But he says there is another record to set straight, and this time it is his.","“I started reading stories about me, about what I thought, what I felt, and I realised if I didn’t do this it was leaving it up to others to write history. I loved the opportunity to do the job. It was an unbelievable honour. I’m glad I did it but I’m also glad I moved on.”","And move on he has, to the UAE for a few days at least.

{"originalurl":"https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/03/16/facebook-we-wont-share-data-with-whatsapp-yet/","title":"Facebook: we won’t share data with WhatsApp (yet) – Naked Security","text":["WhatsApp can’t share user data with parent Facebook without breaking the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), so it won’t.","It’s signed a public commitment not to share personal data with Facebook until data protection concerns are addressed.","No harm, no foul, no fine, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said on Wednesday as it wrapped up an investigation into whether WhatsApp could legally share users’ data with Facebook as it wanted.","In August 2016, WhatsApp announced that it was going to start sharing users’ phone numbers and other personal information with Facebook, in spite of years of promises that it would never, ever do such a thing.","The move was for ad targeting, of course, and to give businesses a way to communicate with users about other things, like letting your bank inform you about a potentially fraudulent transaction or getting a heads-up from an airline about a delayed flight. The reasons fell into three buckets: targeted advertising, security, and evaluation and improvement of services (“business intelligence”).","For a window of 30 days, WhatsApp offered users the option of opting out of data sharing for the purposes of advertising, but no way to entirely opt out of the new data sharing scheme.","The move outraged privacy advocates. After all, at the time of its $19 billion acquisition by Facebook in 2014, WhatsApp had promised never to share data.","That promise goes back further still. In November 2009, WhatsApp founder Jan Koum posted this to the company’s blog:","So first of all, let’s set the record straight. We have not, we do not and we will not ever sell your personal information to anyone. Period. End of story. Hopefully this clears things up.","Clear as mud. In December, France told WhatsApp and Facebook to knock off the data sharing. France’s ultra-vigilant privacy watchdog, the Chair of the National Data Protection Commission (CNIL), gave WhatsApp and Facebook a month to comply with an order to stop sharing data. In its public notice, it said that the messaging app will face sanctions for sharing user phone numbers and usage data for “business intelligence” purposes if it didn’t comply.","WhatsApp swore that it would work to comply with all these data protection authorities, even though they were all barking out differing orders:","We’re committed to resolving the different, and at times conflicting, concerns we’ve heard from European Data Protection Authorities with a common EU approach before the General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May 2018.","Ahhh, the GDPR: it’s right around the corner, and it features in that public commitment the ICO got WhatsApp to sign.","The document outlines the history of WhatsApp’s privacy policy before and after the Facebook acquisition. The upshot: outside of using UK customers’ data as a “data processor” – data sharing done in order for Facebook to provide support service to WhatsApp, such as to run its messaging service, or perhaps to help out a business that takes out an ad on Facebook to refer people to its WhatsApp account – there’s been no data shared.","My investigation has not been concerned about WhatsApp’s sharing of personal data with Facebook when Facebook are only providing a support service to WhatsApp.","The technical term for such sharing is that WhatsApp can use Facebook as a data processor. This is common practice and if done consistently with the law, under contract, does not generally raise data protection concerns.","In the public commitment, WhatsApp promises to refrain from sharing data with Facebook until the GDPR comes into effect in May, and only if it can do so in accordance with the regulation.","Denham said in her announcement that the investigation had been sparked by outcry from the public and from regulators over WhatsApp and Facebook sharing data.","At the heart of these concerns lies a desire for improved transparency, control, and accountability, at a time when personal data is ever more central to the business models of key players in the digital economy.","One of many examples of that loud outcry: The EU’s influential privacy body, the Article 29 Working Party (WP29), in October 2016 published an unflattering open letter outlining its worries.","Isabelle Falque Pierrotin, who chairs the working party, explained the problem, which was that the new terms had contradicted promises made to users when they signed up for the service:","These changes have been introduced in contradiction with previous public statements of the two companies ensuring that no sharing of data would ever take place.","The companies had also been vague about the precise nature of the sharing, she said:","The Article 29 Working Party has serious concerns regarding the manner in which the information relating to the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy was provided to users and consequently about the validity of the users’ consent.","Post navigation","About the author","Lisa has been writing about technology, careers, science and health since 1995.

There are so many free and secure alternatives. My preferred one is Threema but there are many other, depending on taste. Just take a few friends a give a chance to an alternative.

The information, such as cities users said they lived in, content they liked, and information about their friends, was collected from an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” made by Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge.","Facebook said that in 2015 when it first learned users’ data had been passed to other companies, such as Cambridge Analytica, it demanded that those companies certify the data had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica is accused of having lied.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Paul Grewal, a VP and general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.”","The late-evening announcement points to another example of questionable online behaviour tied to the 2016 US presidential election. We’ve already learned that automated bot programs and operatives working on behalf of the Russian government appear to have manipulated Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and other social networks as part of a broad misinformation campaign that’s now being investigated by both the FBI and the US Senate.","Though investigators have been focused on Russia, they’ve also turned attention to Trump’s presidential campaign, which had hired Cambridge Analytica to run data operations. Late last year, The Wall Street Journal reported the firm was asked to hand over documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, which is investigating election meddling.","Now Facebook says it’s received claims Cambridge Analytica misused data about more than a quarter million users. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook said, adding that it now reviews apps to ensure they don’t violate its policies. “We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","Neither Cambridge Analytica, Kogan nor The White House responded to requests for comment.","On Saturday morning, Cambridge Analytica said in a tweet that it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service” and that it doesn’t “hold or use any data” from Facebook profiles. It also pointed to a statement about the issue on its website.","Among other things, the statement says Cambridge Analytica deleted the data in question and that the firm “only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly.” It also says the company’s data protection policies “comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.” Cambridge Analytica said it’s in contact with Facebook “to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Those who know her say she is in exactly the right place at the right time.","Story continues below advertisement","Story continues below advertisement","“She is totally on top of this,” Ann Cavoukian, who served three terms as information and privacy commissioner for Ontario, said in an interview.","Ms. Denham has already given some indication of her approach: After Facebook said it planned to search Cambridge Analytica offices, Ms. Denham asked Facebook to stand down and said her office would be applying for a warrant to pursue its own investigation.","“That puts her in an ideal position – she will have full access to all the data and she will leave no stone unturned, in terms of what did Cambridge Analytica do with this data from Facebook,” Ms. Cavoukian said.","In B.C., Ms. Denham earned a reputation as a tough commissioner who was a frequent and vocal critic of the government, including in one investigation that ended in a charge under the province’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.","The final report from that investigation, titled “Access Denied,” uncovered gaping failures in the provincial government’s information practices, including the practice of “triple deleting” e-mails so that they would be expunged from government systems.","Government staffer George Gretes was later charged with making false statements to mislead Ms. Denham’s office. He pleaded guilty in 2016 and was ordered to pay $2,500 in restitution.","Story continues below advertisement","The investigation also had a “wide, sweeping impact on the way the government operates,” Drew McArthur, B.C.’s acting information and privacy commissioner, said in an interview.","“As a result of her work in the office, we say we punch well above our weight,” he added.","Speaking to a parliamentary committee before her formal appointment in 2016, Ms. Denham said heading the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office would be her “life’s work” and that she was “battle-tested” as a commissioner.","In a 2013 interview, she told The Globe and Mail that her parents ardently followed the civil-rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s and that she grew up listening to historical and political debates at the dinner table.","In a 2017 speech, she said she was an admirer of Arthur Doughty, an archivist who set up what is now the National Archives of Canada, and displays a quote from him on her wall at home.","In part, that 1924 quote reads, “when all personal touch with that period has ceased, then these records assume a startling importance, for they replace hands that have vanished and lips that are sealed.”","At the ICO, she is dealing with a volume and type of records unimaginable in 1924. But it won’t be the first time she has dealt with such challenges.","“She has seen this before – this is not her first time around dealing with some of these issues,” Vincent Gogolek, the recently retired executive director of B.C. Freedom of Information and Privacy Association, an advocacy group, said.","“The fact that data [are] being used in political context by political parties or political actors – this would have been something she has seen before.”","For the Facebook case, Ms. Denham has also drawn on other expertise from British Columbia. Michael McEvoy, B.C.’s deputy information commissioner who has worked in that office for years, has been seconded from B.C. to the British investigation. Mr. McEvoy will take over as B.C.’s commissioner on April 1.","Editor’s note: A previous version of this story said George Gretes faced a criminal charge for making misleading statements to B.C.’s information and privacy commissioner.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2IBKHco?tid=ss_tw-bottom&utm_term=.9fc17e4e0fde","title":"U.S. and European officials question Facebook’s protection of personal data - The Washington Post","text":["U.S. and European officials on Sunday called for Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how personal information about tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm that worked for President Trump’s 2016 campaign — without the permission or knowledge of the vast majority of those affected.","News reports about Facebook’s role in the aggressive form of data collection also have raised serious questions about whether the company violated a landmark consent decree with a federal watchdog agency designed to prevent privacy violations. Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

What they unwittingly did was give their data to Cambridge Analytica.","But that’s the point — people give away alot of very personal information to Facebook. Then they just as quickly give it away to third parties without really knowing what in heaven’s name they’re doing with the information.","Here are the three basic ways we’re handing over very personal information — our birthday, our “likes,” our preferences, who we’re friends with online — and how quickly it can be taken from us.","1. The simple act ofsigning upfor Facebook","It’s that simple. Some people think Facebook doesn’t have all that much information on them because they rarely use it. You may be a lurker. How much data can Facebook really have on you?","A lot! If you’re curious about what kind of data Facebook has about you, you can follow these steps to download your personal Facebook history. In these archives you’ll find fun things you probably never thought were stored on a server somewhere about you.","The archive contains a list of IP addresses that you’ve used to logged into your Facebook account, ads that you clicked on, and cell phone numbers associated with your account.","Facebook also tracks this type of data you entered onto the platform:","A facial recognition ID that is associated with your photo and is used to identify images of you","Your maiden name","Credit card information","Your hometown","Your political views","Your addresses","Any networks you’re associated with — like colleges or companies you belonged to","2. The even simpler act of using Facebook","Facebook keeps detailed data of all your preferences and every one of your “likes” — and it leverages that information for super-precise ad targeting. By reacting to Facebook posts, it’s kind of like you’re participating in an ongoing consumer survey exclusively for Facebook.","Your activity log can give you a pretty good idea of your Facebook behavior over time. It’s a record of all your activities from today all the way back to the day you signed up for your account. Here, you’ll find every like, :haha:, :wow:, :angry:, :love:, and :sad: reaction you’ve ever made to a Facebook post; every video, song, and photo you’ve looked at, listened to, posted, and been tagged in. It also keeps every change to your profile you’ve ever made.","3. Signing in to third-party apps through Facebook","You know that convenient option of logging into a third-party app with your Facebook credentials? Once you click “continue,” you’re allowing this app — it could be Spotify, Farmville, or, say, a survey being conducted by a Russian-American academic connected to Cambridge Analytica — to access a ton of the precious personal data that Facebook has on you.","For example, if you use Tinder via Facebook, you have to hand over at least some basic information about your public profile, which includes your name, your gender, and anything else you posted publicly about yourself.","By default, the app also asks for access to a complete list of your friends, what genders you are interested in, your birthday, your work and educational history, any photo you’ve ever uploaded or are tagged in, any pages and groups you like, and your email address.","Unless you edit the default settings upon your first Tinder login — and you probably don’t — you automatically give the dating app all this data.","These are only a few of the data points that apps may ask for. Here’s a complete list.","Back in 2014 — when the academic linked to Cambridge Analytica, Aleksandr Kogan, used his app to collect data — Facebook users were also able to give third-party apps permission to gather not just personal information but also the information of their friends. At the time, this data included things like the check-ins, locations, and interests of a user’s friend.","“The news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica should serve as a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks in a world where a near-endless stream of personal information is collected indefinitely stored, analyzed, and re-used by marketers, identity thieves, and professional government snoops,” Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told BuzzFeed News through a spokesperson."],"isopubdate":""}

Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

As a result of the backlash that followed the revelations the political consulting company at the centre of the scandal, Cambridge Analytica, has been shut down, as has its parent company SCL Group. Here’s an overview of the companies and people involved, and what they’re alleged to have done.","Which company is which","Canadian data analyst Chris Wylie has worked for or co-founded several firms whose clients included major players in the 2016 U.S. election, the Brexit referendum and Canadian politics. Then, Mr. Wylie became a whistle-blower alleging impropriety in how some of those companies handled data gathered from Facebook.","Cambridge Analytica: A political data analytics firm co-founded by Mr. Wylie, who left the company four years ago. It specializes in mining large amounts of consumer data for behavioural trends that political organizations can use for targeted marketing. Cambridge Analytica harvested millions of people’s Facebook data without authorization in 2014, according to reports earlier this month in The New York Times and Britain’s Observer, a sister paper to the Guardian newspaper. Mr. Wylie’s initial estimate was that 50 million people’s data had been collected, but later, Facebook’s own figures showed an even higher number: 87 million Facebook users worldwide (including, as it turned out, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg), including some 622,000 Canadians. Cambridge Analytica’s partners and patrons included Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit campaign organization. In 2016, Cambridge Analytica would also end up doing political work for future U.S. President Donald Trump’s general election campaign. On May 2, news broke that Cambridge Analytica is shutting down, a decision that was reportedly taken because the company was losing clients and faced rising legal fees over the Facebook investigation.","Story continues below advertisement","AggregateIQ: A B.C.-based consultancy firm that Mr. Wylie helped to create, and which he says created Ripon, the program used by Cambridge Analytica to target Republican voters in the United States. AIQ is under official scrutiny in Britain for its role in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Mr. Wylie and another whistle-blower, former Vote Leave volunteer Shahmir Sanni, allege that AIQ wrongfully received campaign funds from the anti-EU side in the referendum, while a group of British lawyers released documents purporting to show that AIQ participated in a plan to break election laws. AIQ has denied any wrongdoing.","SCL Elections: The parent company of Cambridge Analytica. In 2013, SCL was forging ties with U.S. hedge-fund tycoon Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah. This also brought them into a relationship with Steve Bannon, then a political adviser to the Mercers. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers were instrumental in bringing Mr. Trump to the presidency, the former as his campaign adviser and the latter as major donors. SCL Elections’ CEO, Alexander Nix, was also in charge of Cambridge Analytica, until the company suspended him. An undercover investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 appeared to show Mr. Nix and other Cambridge Analytica executives suggesting they could use bribes to help clients achieve their ends, or hire sex workers to put political opponents in compromising positions.","SCL Group: The British-based parent company of SCL Elections bills itself as an expert in helping businesses, intelligence services and the military use data to shape public behaviour. On May 2, SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed that it and its subsidiary, Cambridge Analytica, would be shuttered.","Eunoia Technologies: A data-analytics company founded by Mr. Wylie after he left Cambridge Analytica. In 2016, the firm had a $100,000 contract with the Liberal Research Bureau, a taxpayer-funded parliamentary office that supports Liberal MPs, for a pilot project having to do with social-media monitoring. This was one of many interactions between Parliament Hill and Mr. Wylie, who once worked for the Liberals.","March 20, 2018: Alexander Nix arrives at the offices of Cambridge Analytica in central London. Cambridge Analytica has suspended him as chief executive amid the revelations about its data-harvesting practices.","Henry Nicholls/REUTERS","What did Cambridge Analytica do?","How they got the data: Mr. Wylie and Cambridge Analytica formed a partnership in 2013 with Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University academic. Dr. Kogan developed a Facebook app for personality testing, dubbed “thisisyourdigitallife,” which some 270,000 people downloaded and used. But the app’s licensing agreement required users to give over personal information not only from their own Facebook profiles, but from those of Facebook friends with low privacy settings. Here’s how Mr. Wylie described it to the Observer:","What did they do with the data? Using algorithms derived from the Facebook information, AggregateIQ developed a program called Ripon, Mr. Wylie told a British parliamentary committee on March 27. Ripon, named after the Wisconsin town credited as the birthplace of the Republican Party, was designed to manage fundraising and voter databases, target specific voters and use surveys to gather more political data.","Was that legal? Facebook’s rules at the time allowed for research techniques like Mr. Kogan’s app, but didn’t allow data collected by such methods to be passed along to third parties, especially not for commercial purposes. Facebook says it learned in 2015 that the collected personal data was still out there, but instead of disclosing that, Facebook discreetly asked the parties to destroy the data, and believed them when they said they had done so. Cambridge Analytica, for its part, said it never collected the Facebook data itself, blaming Dr. Kogan for gathering the data improperly. Dr. Kogan has portrayed himself as a scapegoat in the affair, telling the BBC that Cambridge Analytica were the ones who drafted his app’s terms of service and that, as far as he knew, the data-collection methods were legitimate.","Story continues below advertisement","Story continues below advertisement","Had they tried anything like this before? The SCL-AIQ partnership wanted to try out their data-gathering tactics in Trinidad and Tobago in 2013, according to records obtained by The Globe. There, they planned to gather data in bulk from an internet service provider, hoping to create voters that would benefit a local political party. But it was unclear if AIQ or SCL actually collected the data.","The office of Cambridge Analytica is shown in central London on March 20, after it was announced that Britain's information commissioner is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's computer servers.","The whistle-blower","Mr. Wylie, the 28-year-old British Columbian who helped found Cambridge Analytica, has portrayed himself as an unlikely accomplice to the conservative schemes of Mr. Bannon and the Mercers. A gay vegan of liberal persuasion, he got interested in data’s potential to explain or predict elections when he was a student in London who worked for the Liberal Democrat party, according to the Observer’s profile of him. A party connection introduced Mr. Wylie to SCL, whose founder, Mr. Nix, gave him total freedom to pursue his ideas. But Mr. Wylie’s relationship with his employers soured as they got deeper into U.S. conservative politics: “Rules don’t matter for them,” he told the Times. “For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair. They want to fight a culture war in America.”","Mr. Wylie’s interest in politics and fighting injustice began at a young age, The Globe and Mail’s Patrick White reports. Growing up in Victoria, the six-year-old Mr. Wylie was attacked at elementary school by a fellow student, leading to a court battle and a settlement of $290,000. The young Mr. Wylie got involved in Victoria city hall, became a Liberal Party supporter and, in 2008, he went to work for a Liberal MP who knew his parents, Keith Martin. At 17, he worked for the federal Liberals under then-leader Stéphane Dion. A Liberal staffer told The Globe that he pressed the party to microtarget voters using data, but like the Liberal Democrats, they ignored him.","Speaking at a London journalism event on March 20, Mr. Wylie accused Facebook of ignoring him too when, after he left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, he tried to raise concerns with the California company about the harvested data. Facebook deleted him from the platform and associated sites, and he says Facebook is more concerned with blaming him than with fixing their own privacy issues:","Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, speaks at a Republican Party dinner in 2017. Mr. Bannon was a major client of Cambridge Analytica.","The Associated Press","The big political questions","Did Cambridge Analytica influence the U.S. election? That’s unclear. Mr. Wylie has said he’s unsure how much the Trump campaign relied on Cambridge Analytica’s data. Mr. Trump’s campaign has denied using their data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee‘s information instead. Behind the scenes, Cambridge Analytica’s Mr. Nix has been much more confident of the firm’s impact on American politics: In the undercover Channel 4 investigation, he said the firm’s work played a decisive role in the 2016 election. But those comments could not be verified.","Did it influence the Brexit referendum in 2016? It’s unclear whether the data itself had a real impact, though Mr. Wylie and others allege that Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ served as proxies that helped the Leave campaign skirt financing rules. AggregateIQ co-founder Jeff Silvester denied that the company had “knowingly been involved in any illegal activity.”","Story continues below advertisement","Did it ever influence Canadian politics? Mr. Wylie’s ties to the federal Liberals have raised questions about what the party knew about his or SCL’s activities, but there has been no suggestion of impropriety or influence on the Canadian political process.","For the most part, it seems Liberal officials ignored (or at least didn’t adopt) Mr. Wylie’s ideas about Big Data. One exception was Ray Larson, an associate of Mr. Wylie’s and federal Liberal strategist in Victoria, who once described himself on his website as “head of operations for the SCL Group.” Then in 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Research Bureau awarded a $100,000 contract to Eunoia Technologies. In a statement, the bureau said the contract was for a pilot project that involved “acquiring and setting up social-media monitoring tools.”","Did it influence other elections? Cambridge Analytica executives told an undercover Channel 4 journalist that they had worked in more than 200 elections worldwide. AIQ’s involvement in the 2015 Nigerian election included the dissemination of graphic video content and “incredibly anti-Islamic and threatening messages,\" Mr. Wylie told British parliamentarians, adding that this was one of many dirty-tricks campaigns AIQ was involved in. SCL Group boasted about its success in using religious leaders to suppress voters in Nigeria, according to promotional brochures given by Mr. Wylie to the parliamentary committee.","What governments are doing","United States: Facebook has faced new calls for regulation from Congress and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards, but it is unclear whether or how the Republican-controlled legislature will act. Mr. Zuckerberg is testifying on April 10-11 before the Senate commerce and judiciary committees.","Elizabeth Denham, a former B.C. privacy commissioner, is now the British government's information watchdog. Her office is looking into Cambridge Analytica's role in the Brexit referendum.","DARRYL DYCK/THE CANADIAN PRESS","Britain: The U.K.’s Information Commissioner is investigating whether Facebook data was illegally acquired and used. “This is a complex and far reaching investigation for my office and any criminal or civil enforcement actions arising from it will be pursued vigorously,” commissioner Elizabeth Denham said, days before investigators from her office executed a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s London offices. Mr. Wylie and Mr. Nix have also testified before Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.","Canada: Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien’s office is formally investigating Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica data, and Mr. Therrien said he would like to investigate AggregateIQ’s role as well. The House ethics committee voted to investigate the data leak and call on Mr. Wylie to testify, as well as executives from Facebook and other tech companies.","Europe: EU lawmakers will investigate whether the Facebook users’ data was misused, said Antonio Tajani, head of European Parliament.","April 10, 2018: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is surrounded by journalists as he arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the Senate judiciary and commerce committees on Capitol Hill in Washington.","LEAH MILLIS/Reuters","What Facebook is doing","Cleaning house: Facebook has suspended SCL and Cambridge Analytica from the platform, and hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to look into Cambridge Analytica. In a statement, vice-president Paul Grewal played down the idea that this was a privacy breach: “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” Mr. Grewal also accused Dr. Kogan of having lied to Facebook and breached its privacy rules in his research activities.","Appealing to Congress: On April 10, Mr. Zuckerberg faced a nearly five-hour-long congressional hearing where U.S. lawmakers questioned him about his company’s data-collection practices. But while some politicians in the Republican-controlled legislature said they might pursue regulations against Facebook, there were few indications about how. Ahead of the hearing in Washington, Mr. Zuckerberg announced Facebook would set up an independent election research commission to look at the effects of social media on elections and democracy.","Improving privacy: On March 21, in his first public remarks on the scandal, Mr. Zuckerberg apologized for a “major breach of trust” at the social network, which spent the ensuing weeks rolling out new privacy measures, both to combat measures like those used by Cambridge Analytica and to comply with sweeping European Union privacy laws being introduced in May. These measures include:","Barring apps from collecting many personal details about users, including their political and religious views, relationship status, education and video-watching activity.","Requiring developers to get Facebook’s permission before accessing information about events, groups and pages posted on the platform.","Barring advertisers from targeting users based on information purchased from data brokers.","What’s next for Silicon Valley?","The Cambridge Analytica affair is only the latest scandal to put social-media tech companies under pressure for their political influence, especially in the 2016 U.S. election. U.S. authorities have uncovered evidence over the past year and a half that a St. Petersburg troll factory, the Internet Research Agency, tried to meddle in the election by creating political agitation groups and fake ads to inflame political tensions through social media. Thirteen Russians have been charged in the alleged plot by special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into ties between Russian nationals and the Trump campaign. The Russian meddling exposed major vulnerabilities in how Facebook’s algorithms can be exploited by foreign powers, and renewed calls for tighter regulation of the social-media giant. Mr. Zuckerberg made it his goal for 2018 to fix these problems and prevent future abuse.","Mr. Zuckerberg’s fellow tech gurus, facing blowback from their own users about how their personal information is used, have begun to openly support the idea of regulation. Speaking at a business forum in Beijing, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was “personally not a big fan of regulation,” but “well crafted” rules could be necessary to address the bigger problems.","What can I do?","For some Facebook users, Cambridge Analytica has been a wake-up call to curb or completely stop using the social-media service: The mayor of Mr. Wylie’s hometown, for instance, says she deleted her account. But issues of data privacy go far beyond Facebook, and short of complete abstinence from the internet, there’s no way to remove it from your life completely. But here are some useful steps:","Audit your Facebook apps: Go to the setting page and click on the Apps tab to see which services are connected to your account, and which permissions you granted them.","Check your privacy settings: If you're concerned about what your Facebook friends (and the apps they use) can know about you, review your settings and change them accordingly.","Install tracker blockers: Browser add-ons like Privacy Badger and Disconnect let you deactivate trackers installed on the website you visit.","Read terms of service carefully: Whenever you sign up for a new app or service, check to see what data it collects before you download or install it. If you do install it anyway, familiarize yourself with the privacy controls so you know where to go later in case you want to change them.","We have closed comments on this story for legal reasons or for abuse.

We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","Facebook’s move to suspend Cambridge Analytica came just hours before The New York Times and the British newspaper The Observer both released reports that raised questions about the handling of Facebook data by the company and its associates.","In a statement, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied that the organization is in violation of Facebook’s terms and said it is in communication with Facebook following the news it had been suspended from the platform.","The spokesperson said that in 2014, Cambridge Analytica contracted with Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR) “to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,” obtaining data and seeking “the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” the spokesperson added.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Sen.

In his statement, he added: “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Cambridge University acknowledged they knew of Kogan’s company, Global Science Research (GSR), but said they do not believe “he used University data or facilities for his work with GSR, and therefore that there is no reason to believe the University’s data and facilities were used as the basis for GSR’s subsequent work with any other party.”","“It is important to make clear that, despite its name, Cambridge Analytica has no connection or association with the University whatsoever.”","Cambridge Analytica was hired in summer 2016 as part of the Trump campaign’s three-pronged data operation.","Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica until he stepped down to run the Trump campaign in August 2016.","William A. Burck, an attorney for Bannon, said in a statement on Bannon’s behalf: “The first Mr. Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days. He has nothing to say because he knows nothing about the claims being asserted and would direct questions to Mr. Nix, who ran Cambridge Analytica the entire time Mr. Bannon was associated with it.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” Denham’s statement said.","“It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro target voters,” she added.","CNN previously reported in October 2017 that the firm had contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016 regarding thousands of Hillary Clinton’s emails kept on a private server while she was secretary of state, according to four sources familiar with the outreach.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Aleander Nix sent an email that said he had reached out to Assange in attempt to access emails from Clinton’s private server in hopes to create a searchable database of the emails for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee, according to two sources.","CNN reported that no one from the Trump campaign was copied on the email, the sources said. Nix sent the email in the summer of 2016, two sources said, but it is not clear whether he sent it before or after Cambridge Analytica was brought onto the campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

This makes it harder for Facebook to track your activity on other websites via third-party cookies.","Rather than stop using a service you find valuable and miss out on those adorable photos of your nephew, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can collect about you. That includes us: Mozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We only know the number of times the extension is installed or removed.","When you install this extension it will delete your Facebook cookies and log you out of Facebook. The next time you visit Facebook it will open in a new blue-colored browser tab (aka “container tab”). In that tab you can login to Facebook and use it like you normally would. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.","Should you click on any Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs it will load them within the Facebook container. You should know that when you’re using these buttons information will be sent to Facebook about the website that you shared from.","If you use your Facebook credentials to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials, it may not work properly and you may not be able to login. Also, because you’re logged into Facebook in the container tab, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook container tab will not work.

Having once read Starr’s remarks on this subject, it becomes impossible to see photographs of the Facebook founder without also seeing the stagecraft employed in nearly every image to conceal the truth about his height.","Zuckerberg is a brand, the chief executive of one of the world’s most valuable companies, and a would-be presidential candidate. Making him look taller is important because everything about a brand and a would-be president must be crafted to evoke warmth, admiration, and good feelings so the people keep coming, keep reading, keep liking, keep paying. And eventually, someday, maybe, keep coming out to vote.","So here he is in the New York Times, traveling the country, sitting way up high on a tractor in Wisconsin, a native companion looking deferentially up at him. Here he is, smiling, having quite recently decided he’s “no longer an atheist” in the Charleston church where Dylann Roof killed nine people. Here he is, giving a commencement speech at Harvard, informing those assembled that “Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are needed, that we have something better ahead to work for.”","Thus the public is taught to believe that Mark Zuckerberg is tall, and also generous, a thoughtful and responsible custodian of our private information, a wise and intelligent leader. And how surprised can we be, when literally anyone — no matter how corrupt, greedy, base, or stupid — can be president, a fact that has never been more obvious than it is now.","(I’m not saying that small people are evil. I am small myself…okay, we are totally evil.)","People who seek high office should have a long record of honesty, good judgment, and good character. That should not be too much to ask, but it disqualifies a lot of people, Mark Zuckerberg among them.","Despite his refusal to acknowledge his responsibility for that fiasco, Zuckerberg and his company have issued plenty of apologies for other derelictions. He “visited” hurricane-torn Puerto Rico from a distance (3,588 miles) that makes George W. Bush’s infamous flyover tour of New Orleans after Katrina look like Albert Schweitzer ministering to lepers in Lambarene. (Sorry!)","Here they are, apologizing for secretly manipulating the news feeds of nearly a million people in an in-house “experiment” (Sorry!); for getting a Palestinian man arrested for saying “good morning” (Sorry!); for censoring Palestinian journalists (Sorry!); for blocking Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King (Sorry!); for fat-shaming a plus-size model (Sorry!); for suspending a black activist’s account after she posted threats she’d received (Sorry!); for helping themselves to commercial rights of user photos posted on its Instagram service (Sorry!); for overstating their video metrics (Sorry!); for tolerating violent imagery toward women (Sorry!); for permitting a suicide victim’s photograph to be used on a dating site ad (Sorry!).","It would benefit Mark Zuckerberg, it would be worth it for him to pay a lot of money for you to believe that he is a good leader, worthy of your trust, and there’s evidence that he does just that. But a clear-eyed assessment of the record forces us to conclude that Mark Zuckerberg is not remotely a good or trustworthy leader.","Personal messages written in 2003 and leaked to Business Insider in 2010 exposed the private, unvarnished Zuckerberg, the pre-Potemkin Zuckerberg, before any PR flacks, pollsters, or media coaches had arrived on the scene. He started his career as a rapacious plutocrat with a bang by getting rid of his initial seed investor, Eduardo Saverin, massively diluting Saverin’s investment; the two later came to a settlement. Private messages were also leaked to Silicon Alley Insider in the wake of the legal scuffle between Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who claimed that Zuckerberg had lied to them and stolen their ideas in order to build TheFacebook.com; they too came to an eventual settlement.","Here’s Zuckerberg explaining to a friend over IM, back then, what he intended to do about the Winklevoss twins:","FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites?ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck themZUCK: probably in the yearZUCK: *ear","Confronted with these allegations six years later, Facebook issued a nondenial denial worthy of Sarah Huckabee Sanders: “We’re not going to debate the disgruntled litigants and anonymous sources who seek to rewrite Facebook’s early history or embarrass Mark Zuckerberg with dated allegations. The unquestioned fact is that since leaving Harvard for Silicon Valley nearly six years ago, Mark has led Facebook’s growth from a college website to a global service playing an important role in the lives of over 400 million people.”","Well…that’s just the problem, isn’t it. Nobody had ever doubted that Facebook was huge. The question was, then as now: Was — is — Mark Zuckerberg fit to lead a company of this magnitude and influence?","How is it that such a transparently devious company as Facebook could be welcomed so warmly by so many? The reason is not far to seek. Individual users see Facebook through the lens of real, loving, intimate connections with their own friends and family; for millions of people, Facebook’s face is the face of love, a composite of the faces of their own children, grandchildren, neighbors, lovers, teachers, professors, and friends. How can this friendly place do us harm, or even wish us harm? How could it possibly be cruel, selfish, and dangerous?","The sad truth is that friendly face isn’t Facebook’s true face; it’s a sham, just like it’s a sham to sit on a tractor so people will think you’re tall. Mark Zuckerberg uses your most intimate connections, the literal faces of the people you love, to fool you into thinking that he’s not picking your pocket and taking a wrecking ball to our media, to the integrity of our society, and to democracy itself. (And it’s a simple fact that “Facebook” and “Zuckerberg” are terms that may be used interchangeably, since he has moved heaven and earth to retain absolute control of the company.) All your grandma’s recipes, all your birthday party photos and shower invitations and cat videos and viral YouTubes and reunion announcements boil down to one thing, and that thing is money.","To be charitable, maybe Zuckerberg believes his own bushwah? Lately he has been talking a lot about “empathy,” and on reflection, I have to admit the demonstrations of compassion he’s been broadcasting in recent months have been reasonably convincing, for a beginner. But let’s think about this announcement from January for a moment, in which Zuckerberg claims he is going to make Facebook all about “bringing people closer together.”","“[W]e’re making a major change to how we build Facebook. I’m changing the goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions.”","Surely the only conceivable answer a sane person can make to a billionaire monopolist who is trying to be involved in or have an opinion about or monetize the “meaningful social interactions” in your personal life is: Kindly get the fuck away from me. Or in the words of the poet, You don’t know me, you’re too old, let go, it’s over. I mean, I would say that, if I hadn’t quit Facebook many years ago.","The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do — whether it’s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.","My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues. We won’t prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools. If we’re successful this year then we’ll end 2018 on a much better trajectory.","Facebook is not a “community.” It is a wealth-creation machine built from private messages and friendships and cat videos and other publications’ journalism, mixed up, wrung out for salable information, plastered with ads, and otherwise corrupted for money on its way to your “news” (ha!) feed.","There’s no credible evidence, none at all, to indicate that this jackal has changed his spots, stripes, whatever, since he wrote this private message to a friend at Harvard back in the early aughts:","ZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvardZUCK: just askZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, snsFRIEND: what!? how’d you manage that one?ZUCK: people just submitted itZUCK: i don’t know whyZUCK: they “trust me”ZUCK: dumb fucks"],"isopubdate":""}

In today's world, data is a form of soft power, and it is essential for those who wield it, to use it responsibly so that consumer confidence isn't compromised.","The challenge is that, at an idea-generation stage, it can be difficult to draw a clear, bright line between whether data is being used for optimisation or for manipulation.","Take, for instance, the Obama and Trump campaigns in the US. The former used the same digital platforms for optimising communication and ensuring voter confidence and dissemination of information. On the other hand, British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used the same platforms but with malafide intent -- to manipulate the views and preferences of voters.","As investigations continue, it is increasingly clear that data was stolen, models used were unauthorised for the purpose they were being used, the messages (in many cases) were outright lies.","So the whole operation was questionable from the get-go. It is, therefore, extremely critical to demarcate this difference -- are the final consumers of a data-driven model being actively manipulated or is data being used to merely optimise a communications strategy?","It is also essential to clearly define the parties involved in the data \"lifecycle\" and their roles and responsibilities, with regard to how data is being used. There are usually three parties in this lifecycle, each requiring a different kind of oversight and norms.","First are the data originators, those that capture and store the data. And I'm not only talking about Facebook and Google, but also a wide range of other originators -- for e.g. Equifax (which holds extremely sensitive consumer credit information), banks (which store individual-centric financial information), telecom organisations (which hold a treasure trove of communications and browsing information), etc.","Two safeguards are critical here.","One, data security safeguards to ensure the privacy (external parties shouldn't be able to see it) and integrity (external parties shouldn't be able to change it) of the data. This can be improved by ring-fencing the data sources and ensuring advanced security measures.","And two, ensuring explicit consumer consent for sharing and using this data. This can be done by introducing easy-to-understand verbiage around fair-use -- where their data could be used and for what purposes.","These two interventions -- data security and informing users where data could be shared -- are the key and will go a long way in winning back consumer trust in these platforms.","The second type of entity involved is the data processing companies which employ intelligent algorithms over the data to extract insights. This includes companies like Cambridge Analytica.","Given that data processing companies also have access to a large scale of data, entrusted by clients, it is imperative that their systems are subject to similar levels of security, compliance and governance norms.","This can be resolved through globally-agreed standards of security, enforced through regular third-party audits. We need to be held to the same standards as the data sources themselves when it comes to security of the data so that we aren't the weak link in the event of a data leak.","There may also be value in exploring how we can expressly declare the nature of algorithms employed and the source of these algorithms (in cases where there is a patent to one), to an unaffiliated third-party regulator. This will ensure better transparency around what the data is being used for.","Finally, we have the third party in the data lifecycle: The buyers of the data -- organisations that pay for the data and algorithm-driven insights around it. In this case, they are the political organisations that are beneficiaries of the analysis work by the processing companies.","Here, let's go back to my earlier point of drawing the line between what is optimisation and manipulation.","Are the data buying organisations sponsoring an ad because they feel consumers genuinely stand to benefit from the content, or are they using the data to manipulate users into actions that are not in their best interest?","More importantly, does the ad-sponsoring organisation have the authority to display that ad, or are they a geo-political adversary? This can be cleared up by implementing fair-usage policies around what the extracted data is being used for, who is using it, and what are the implications of that data -- all of which needs to be made more transparent and subject to governance norms in certain cases.","Obviously, the three parties interplay with each other. For instance, Facebook and Google are two of these parties -- the source and the processor. Thus, it needs to be ensured that they be accountable to both sets of norms.","It is imperative that all parties in the data lifecycle take seriously the trust with which data is being shared with them by their users -- for their own good. The way things stand right now, biting around the edges of this debate is not going to win back lost consumer confidence in our industry and we are all the losers in the long term."],"isopubdate":""}

Provide federal assistance to low-income communities;","2. Protect Social Security;","3. Provide asylum for refugees;","4. Extend minimum wage;","5.

So we took a closer look.","All told, the meme is generally accurate in portraying these seven elements of the 1956 platform, with some caveats.","On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 1956 platform said the party would \"promote fully the Republican-sponsored Rural Development Program to broaden the operation and increase the income of low income farm families and help tenant farmers.\"","On protecting Social Security, the platform touted the Eisenhower administration’s extension of Social Security to 10 million more workers and benefits hikes for 6.5 million Americans.","On refugees, the platform spotlighted the administration’s work in sponsoring the Refugee Relief Act \"to provide asylum for thousands of refugees, expellees and displaced persons,\" promising its \"wholehearted support\" for additional efforts. M. Christine Anderson, a Xavier University historian, noted that many refugees were coming from communist countries in Eastern Europe, so this wasn't an especially controversial issue during the Cold War era.","On the minimum wage, the platform notes that the Eisenhower administration raised the minimum wage for more than 2 million workers. It urged extending minimum-wage protections \"to as many more workers as is possible and practicable.\"","On improving the unemployment benefit system, the 1956 platform touted the administration’s actions to bring unemployment insurance to 4 million additional workers, and backed efforts to \"improve the effectiveness of the unemployment insurance system.\"","On strengthening unions, the platform says the \"protection of the right of workers to organize into unions and to bargain collectively is the firm and permanent policy of the Eisenhower Administration.\"","That’s full-throated rhetoric in support of unions -- but the policy reality is a bit more nuanced, said Jennifer Delton, a Skidmore College historian and author of Rethinking the 1950s. The platform did not support unions’ key agenda item that year -- a repeal of states’ ability to pass \"right to work\" laws that would ban compulsory union membership.","On equal pay for equal work regardless of sex, the platform says the Eisenhower administration will \"continue to fight … (to) assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.\"","What the 2012 platform says","The party’s 2012 platform is pretty different, both in tone and substance.","On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 2012 platform takes a much more skeptical view. \"The federal government’s entire system of public assistance should be reformed to ensure that it promotes work,\" the 2012 platform says, arguing that the system has become overly bureaucratized and discourages work. The 2012 platform also takes a shot at federal low-income housing policy, saying the government \"has spent billions more on poorly designed and ineffective housing assistance programs.\"","On Social Security, the platform says current retirees or those approaching retirement should continue to receive Social Security as currently configured. However, it goes on to say that demographic and financial challenges mean that the program is \"long overdue for major change, not just another legislative stopgap that postpones a day of reckoning,\" including the possibility of \"personal investment accounts as supplements to the system.\"","The 2012 platform doesn’t address refugees specifically, but it does address immigration. It criticizes President Barack Obama for creating \"a backdoor amnesty program unrecognized in law (and) granting worker authorization to illegal aliens.\" It also says that \"granting amnesty only rewards and encourages more law-breaking,\" and it promises to \"create humane procedures to encourage illegal aliens to return home voluntarily, while enforcing the law against those who overstay their visas.\"","The 2012 platform doesn’t mention the minimum wage specifically, but it does place an emphasis on free-market business practices rather than government regulation of labor markets, laying the blame for the nation’s weak economic recovery on \"unprecedented uncertainty in the American free enterprise system due to the overreaching policies of the current administration.\"","Even accounting for the nuances of the 1956 platform, the clearest contrast between the two platforms may be in their approach to labor unions. The 2012 platform offers no rhetorical niceties, accusing the Obama administration of \"clinging to antiquated notions of confrontation and concentrating power in the Washington offices of union elites\" and of turning the National Labor Relations Board into \"a partisan advocate for Big Labor, using threats and coercion outside the law to attack businesses.\"","The 2012 platform doesn’t mention two of the meme’s seven items from 1956 -- unemployment benefits and equal pay for women.","The bottom line, then, is that on most of these issues, the GOP moved to the right between 1956 and 2012, though the degree of that shift has varied somewhat issue by issue.","What historians say","We asked scholars whether the contrast between the two platforms is noteworthy, and they generally agreed that it was.","Delton noted that the Republican Party in the 1950s was divided between moderates (including Eisenhower) and conservatives. She said the moderates controlled the process of platform-writing in 1956, but they threw a few bones to conservatives in certain portions of the document. For instance, the platform said the government wouldn’t sign a treaty or enter into an international agreement in violation of individual rights -- an issue that continues to energize conservatives decades later -- and there’s a plank about a balanced budget, which was seen as a conservative position.","The seven items listed in the meme were supported by moderates, Delton said. At the time, she said, \"conservatives would have focused, with horror, on the very items the meme highlights.\"","Eisenhower was facing a Democratic Congress in 1956 and didn’t want to try to reverse the New Deal, Anderson said. \"If the point is that Eisenhower was not as extreme as Republicans today, it is accurate.\"","Our ruling","The meme says the 1956 Republican Party platform supported equal pay, the minimum wage, asylum for refugees, protections for unions and more.","That’s generally correct. However, it’s worth noting that other elements of the 1956 platform were considered conservative for that era. Also, some of the issues have changed considerably between 1956 and 2012, such as the shift from focusing on post-war refugees to focusing on illegal immigration.","The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","Email interview with Stephen Hess, senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution and former staff assistant to President Dwight Eisenhower, Oct. 23, 2014","How to contact us","Email comments and suggestions for fact-checks to [email protected] or find us on Facebook,and Twitter.

{"originalurl":"https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/political-micro-targeting-manchurian-candidate-or-just-dark-horse","title":"Political micro-targeting: a Manchurian candidate or just a dark horse? | Internet Policy Review","text":["Abstract","Political micro-targeting (PMT) has become a popular topic both in academia and in the public discussions after the surprise results of the 2016 US presidential election, the UK vote on leaving the European Union, and a number of general elections in Europe in 2017. Yet, we still know little about whether PMT is a tool with such destructive potential that it requires close societal control, or if it’s “just” a new phenomenon with currently unknown capacities, but which can ultimately be incorporated into our political processes.\nIn this article we identify the points where we think we need to further develop our analytical capacities around PMT. We argue that we need to decouple research from the US context, and through more non-US and comparative research we need to develop a better understanding of the macro, meso, and micro level factors that affect the adoption and success of PMTs across different countries. One of the most under-researched macro-level factors is law. We argue that PMT research must develop a better understanding of law, especially in Europe, where the regulatory frameworks around platforms, personal data, political and commercial speech do shape the use and effectiveness of PMT. We point out that the incorporation of such new factors calls for the sophistication of research designs, which currently rely too much on qualitative methods, and use too little of the data that exists on PMT. And finally, we call for distancing PMT research from the hype surrounding the new PMT capabilities, and the moral panics that quickly develop around its uses.","Editorial: Towards the next generation of political micro-targeting research","It is time to take a critical look at political micro-targeting","Political targeting is not a new phenomenon. Political parties, candidates, and campaigns have a long history of classifying and segmenting the ‘voter market’ in order to optimise their messages to different profiles. Political micro-targeting (PMT), however, only became prominent in recent election cycles. PMT refers to the use of different communications (mail, phone, canvassing, direct mail, and social media advertising, etc.) to communicate and build a relationship with prospective voters. At the core of the concept is the use of data and analytics to craft and convey a tailored message to a subgroup or individual members of the electorate. The 2008 US presidential elections was the first major election that perfected micro-targeting models, by, for example, using information about voters to direct volunteers to ‘scripted conversations with specific voters at the door or over the phone’ (Issenberg, 2012).","The popular myth about PMT is, that it is about voter persuasion. Of course, it be used towards the ‘ultimate’ goal of influencing candidate and party preferences and ultimately behaviour, but it would be a mistake to think if this as its only use. PMT can be used to (dis)encourage political participation, including election turnout. It can (dis)encourage donations and contributions to candidates and campaigns. It can be employed to create energy and interest in a campaign, election and candidate, but it can also be used to create disinterest and apathy.","In the past decade, the reference to and discussion of PMT has increased. The most significant public discussion took place in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential elections. As the public realised the full scope of PMT possibilities, the public debates and news coverage of targeted ads on Facebook, the use of algorithms and foreign funding, and the centrality of data analytics companies led to moral panic, congressional hearings, and the quest for more transparency and understanding of this particular election, and PMT more generally.","At the end of 2017 we have the UK, French, German and Dutch elections behind us, and the Italian one before us. All these elections used one type of PMT or another, marking the point in time, when the PMT techniques developed in the highly innovative and liberal (i.e. under-regulated) US context are being adopted to all kinds of political systems across Europe, and ultimately, across the globe. The task of scrutinising the use and impact of PMT techniques on local elections and political systems in Europe could not be more timely.","Tensions in research","Given the historical development of PMT and today’s uncertainties about the prevalence, impact, and possible lack of regulation of PMT, it becomes important to highlight some of the tensions and inconsistencies in current thinking about the phenomenon. There is a whole range of issues that research needs to address in order to properly grasp PMT, such as how new (or old) the phenomenon really is, whether it represents more of an opportunity than a threat, and finally, whether PMT means the same in different political and regulatory contexts around the globe.","How much is new, how much old?","PMT does not come out of a vacuum. Political advertising and the professionalisation of politics and campaigns have been topics of investigation for decades. On the one hand it is tempting to consider PMT a natural evolution of developing practices in campaigning and advertising. On the other hand, PMT coincides with other fast-paced and almost disruptive developments. PMT is not just a change in approach and methods, it also speaks to a change of institutions. As the campaign spending shifts from billboards, broadcast, and print to online, social, and data, so do the institutions that connect and separate parties and politicians to/from the electorate change (see also Montgomery and Chester in this special issue). These institutions, online media platforms, data brokers, technology providers, analytics companies are perhaps the most novel aspect of today’s PMT compared to other aspects which are more organically evolving aspects of campaigning, data usage, and advertising in general.","As the research on PMT matures it is becoming a relevant question whether PMT is solely an election phenomenon. In the burgeoning literature on how politics and campaigns professionalized in the 1980s and 1990s, it became apparent that some of these developments apply not only to election time, but also to governing (Cook, 2005). Holding an office today does not mean a full electoral cycle break away from monitoring, interacting with and nudging constituencies (Csigó, 2017). In the same vein, PMT can conceivably be used in interesting ways to be part of government communication and thereby unfold not only as a feature of campaigning but also of governing.","Risks vs opportunities: utopian vs dystopian perspectives","The most important opportunities offered by political micro-targeting techniques coincide with the promises of digital advertising. Digital technologies offer more data points to profile individual consumers by. Digital communication channels offer more precise targeting. Taken together, better profiling and better targeting are hoped to provide consumers (voters) with more relevant information, with which they are more likely to engage. Political advertisers, mainly political parties, hope to get more efficient and effective services out those same technologies, for a fraction of the cost. Lower costs and more efficient targeting in turn could lower the entry barriers to the political communication market for smaller parties, and enable parties with limited resources or with a more specific message to reach out to constituents.","All things considered these benefits may lead to a more diverse political marketplace in terms of products and sellers, i.e., issues, parties, candidates; and better informed, more conscious political consumers making better informed political choices. (Borgesius et al., forthcoming)","Some of the risks associated with PMT also mirror concerns raised in the commercial advertising domain: profiling entails a loss of user privacy, targeting opens the door for selective information exposure, and potential manipulation (Bennett, 2015). Political parties, who have to deal with the new, digital intermediaries often in exclusive control of access to voters, may face monopoly prices, and experience a loss of power. Taken together these buyer and seller effects may result in the fragmentation of the marketplace (of ideas), and make it costly for the consumers (voters) to be sufficiently informed about the true nature of the available supply (of ideas, and candidates) on the political marketplace (Borgesius et al., forthcoming).","Yet, at the end of 2017, it seems that the greatest concrete threats of PMT were not what an analogy with commercial advertising would have suggested. First, as we discuss it in more detail in the next section, it seems that different rules apply to commercial and political advertising. While both in the US, the UK and in the EU sophisticated regulatory frameworks protect consumers from false, and misleading commercial advertisements, political speech is not judged by the same standards. As a result, negative advertisement, smear campaigns and the like are often widely used strategies in campaigns (Johnson-Cartee & Copeland, 2013). Second, as it has been realised too late in the 2016 US presidential elections, and just in time in the French one, local political parties are not the only ones to see PMT as an effective tool to influence the outcome of elections. PMT techniques were used by foreign state actors, independent non-governmental organisations, and entrepreneurial individuals alike to take advantage of an election process in various ways. Balkan teens were found to exploit the heated US campaign by spreading fake news for commercial gains (Subramanian, 2017); the independent tech libertarian organisation Wikileaks had a substantial impact on multiple elections, with its sometimes curiously timed releases of confidential information (Bodó, 2014); while the Russian meddling with political events from the 2016 US presidential elections via the 2017 French elections to the current tensions around Catalonia is currently under heavy scrutiny by both local security services and global publics (Director of National Intelligence, 2017; Emmott, 2017; Greenberg, 2017). Third, to make things worse, the intransparency of PMT techniques makes it close to impossible to detect and fully assess such activities.","Finally, it is increasingly apparent the interests of digital intermediaries who enable PMT techniques are not necessarily aligned with the interests of voters, political parties, or the interests of society at large (Caplan, 2016). Such a conflict of interest of the commercial arbitrators of political speech was first described by Robert McChesney (1999) in the context of the US commercial broadcast media. He suggested that the fact that commercial media rather sees political speech in the form of revenue generating ad than a cost-generating news programme is detrimental to democracy. This conflict of interest is especially true for digital intermediaries, most of whom do not produce any content in the first place. There is no guaranteed “organic reach” for even those civil movements, causes, organisations, political parties, political candidates, activists, who otherwise successfully nurture large and well managed online communities; serious news media need to pay if they want to reach audiences, so there is no “public service”, commercially disinterested, non-profit marketplace for political speech on digital intermediaries (Madrigal, 2017; Wagner, 2017). All political audiences are ultimately sold to the highest bidder.","In other words, the biggest opportunity of PMT is also its biggest threat: sophisticated technologies allow anyone to reach any individual or group in an electorate with any message. Moreover, this access is on commercial terms, and on commercial terms only, where the audiences are sold to the highest bidder, without any regard to wider, societal concerns, such as the protection of voters from fraud; a diverse, balanced and competitive marketplace of ideas; a well-informed citizenry; or a level playing field for political parties.","Context vs conditions: legal frameworks matter","Political campaigning and the electoral system are at the heart of the democratic process. Ensuring the fairness, transparency, and openness of this process is paramount to its success. Accordingly, democratic societies have a long tradition of devising rules and procedures to guide political campaigning and political advertising, with the goal of promoting and defending democratic values and fundamental rights in this very process. In Europe, the the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission - with representatives from 60 countries - in 2002 established five fundamental electoral principles, including “universal, equal, free, secret and direct suffrage” - principles that have guided the way national governments design and enable their electoral systems, including the way political advertising is regulated.","Political advertising is protected speech in the sense of Art. 10 ECHR (European Court of Human Rights, VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v. Switzerland), and citizens have the right to inform themselves and receive political information from a diversity of sources and perspectives. Council of Europe member states are under the obligation to enable “free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.” (Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights). This obligation has resulted in rules on various aspects of political campaigning in general, and political advertising specifically.","So far much of the legal debates around political advertising have concentrated on the scope and affordances of data protection law (Bennet, 2016). Data protection law, however, can only go so far to protect principles of universality, equality or freedom of the political, data-driven process. In other words: data protection law is no ‘all purpose tool’, equipped to deal with all challenges of political micro-targeting, simply because they deal with data. Instead, it is high time to include other legal areas into the discussion, and their role in addressing the effects from data analytics, including election, party financing laws, and media law.","With regard to political advertising, one set of rules that is particularly relevant are the rules about party financing that must ensure transparency and fairness in the way parties receive and spend public and private money to fund their (advertising) campaigns (Anstaed and Chadwick, 2016). In response to the use of PMT in the UK Brexit campaign, these provisions stood central in an investigation of the UK Electoral Commission into the extent to which the divestitures in PMT were potentially in conflict with the British rules on campaign financing. Political advertising is also subject to a battery of rules in national media laws - rules that determine meticulously the way in which political parties may or may not advertise on the (traditional) media (many national broadcasting law issue a ban in principle on political advertising in broadcasting), who has to be granted how much advertising time, and what are the limits and who exercises oversight (for an overview, see Apa et al. 2017).","These rules were written for the traditional mass media, and media campaigning. They apply to the broadcasting media, not to platforms, as new central players in political advertising. The challenge is to transport the provisions about equality and fairness, transparency and oversight to the new digital realities of PMT, as well as to the new central players: digital platforms, but also data brokers and analytics firms. The discussion about the regulation of PMT on platforms is part of a broader discussion about the social responsibility of platforms, and the extent to which we can oblige large commercial Silicon Valley companies to observe democratic values, such as media diversity, fairness and equality in the democratic process. It is clear and established that the public service media and newspapers have an important task in providing a platform for the diverse encounters of ideas and opinions. The role and public responsibility of platforms still needs to be carved out. Platforms have come to play a central role in gathering information and forming (political) opinions. They have also become part of the mission-critical campaign infrastructure, next to the traditional media. And yet, many of these platforms are driven by an advertising business model, and from their perspective as advertising companies, political micro-targeting is ‘just’ another form of advertising. And current laws, e-commerce law do little to correct that assumption. PMT is another example that shows that the discrepancy in current regulation between demanding responsible behaviour from the offline media, and providing maximum leeway and ‘room to play’ for the online media as the ‘youngest kid’ in the family, is no longer tenable. Online media, and platforms in particular, have grown up, and it is high time to create more similar standards across different media and different forms of advertising, and more guidance on ‘fair targeting practices’.","For the past decade, a central ambition of regulatory reforms in the area of data protection law but also consumer law sought to create a fairer level playing field for the commercial sister of political advertising: behavioural targeting (BT). Similarly to PMT, behavioural targeting seeks to utilise data-driven insights into consumer preferences and characteristics to optimise advertising, make it more personally relevant, efficient and persuasive. Regulatory reforms in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) must give consumers more information and control rights vis-à-vis data-driven advertisers. As outlined in a symposium1 contribution by Maximilian von Grafenstein and Jessica Schmeiss, the provisions in the European General Data Protection Regulation apply to the collection, processing of personal data in general (irrespective of whether this is done for purposes of commercial or political targeting), as well as to the use of such data to target users with personalised messages. Insofar, data protection law affords consumers and voters a comparable level of protection in terms of the collection and use of their personal data.","This is different for the protection from false and misleading claims. Here, the European Commission addressed in its latest guidance on the Unfair Commercial Practice Directive a range of potentially unfair forms of behavioural targeting; and the ongoing reform of European consumer law must afford more protection to consumers in the digital marketplace. False, misleading or aggressive advertising claims are banned under the provisions of Unfair Commercial Practices. These rules apply to commercial communication, but not necessarily to ideological advertising (also depending on the country in question).","The recent debate about the obligation of platforms to disclose political advertising, too, is from the perspective of consumer law, nothing new under the sun: the obligation to label commercial advertising messages and disclose sponsored content is an iron rule in advertising law and unfair commercial practice law. For political micro-targeting on social networks, such obligations are in many countries still missing, or just about to be drafted.","In other words, many of the rules that must guarantee informed and autonomous decision making in the light of behavioural targeting do not apply to ideological advertising. Similarly, while the commercial advertising industry has developed since long codes of conduct and instances to guard over the fairness and truth in advertising, including digital advertising, such self-regulatory initiatives in the field of political advertising still need to be developed. The question is by whom? Political parties? Platforms? Analytics companies such as Cambridge Analytica? Fairness, truthfulness and transparency are arguably important values, also in the relationship between voters and political parties.","Behavioural and political micro-targeting use essentially the same technologies, sometimes even the same data. And yet we face in Europe the puzzling situation that the trust of consumers in the truthfulness and fairness of commercial behavioural advertising seems to be better protected than that of citizens that are the recipients of political micro-targeting. A critical challenge for the law, and legal scholars in the years to come will be to even out this inadequate and undemocratic imbalance in protection, and devise principles and rules about Unfair Political Practices.","In this context, it can be useful to learn from the diversity of emerging (self)regulatory approaches and experimentations with new solutions in the European Union member states. For example, the Dutch \"Social Media Advertising Code\" (Reclamecode Social Media)2 does address surreptitious political advertising through social media and requires, among others, disclosure of any payment social media users receive for the distribution of advertising messages. In the UK, the Electoral Commission has begun to develop guidance on the rules applicable to online media. In Ireland, the Data Protection Commissioner issued guidelines to candidates for election, and their representatives, on canvassing, data protection and electronic marketing for the General Election in 2016,3 as well as guidance on the use of electronic media for political direct marketing under the principles developed for the regulation for spam. All these are examples for initiatives that seek to develop guidance, either through self-regulation or issued by the regulator, and that have started to carve out principles of fairness in political micro-targeting vis-à-vis voters.","Theory vs practice","The advance of digital technologies and the subsequent uncertainties unleashed a period of moral panics among academics as well as social commentators. There is a strong market for both “TED-talk-sized utopian visions”, and the most dystopian doomsday scenarios of political deception, fragmentation and the ultimate collapse of democracies.","Comparing such speculations with the campaigns and elections until the end of 2017 proved that speculation and the actual practices on the ground were rarely in line. As outlined by the piece on the 2017 Dutch national elections by Tom Dobber et al., or on the 2017 German federal elections by Simon Kruschinski and André Haller a number of practical limitations, such as the lack of expertise, funds or real demand; the particularities of the local jurisdiction; or the political and media systems tend to moderate the theoretically expected (positive or negative) impact of PMT. On the other hand, few, if any theoretical models managed to foresee what turned out to be the greatest threat of not only PMT, but of digital platforms and intermediaries in general, namely that bad faith (state) actors do possess the resources and the incentives to weaponise digital communication platforms, and in times of elections PMTs, and turn them into highly disruptive tools of information warfare (Maréchal, 2016; Patrikarakos, 2017, Powers, 2010).","One might ponder, whether this unexpected turn of events will actually be beneficial in mitigating the worst theoretically predicted threats of PMT and enable us to exploit the opportunities it offers in a more systematic and orderly manner. Threats, such as the aforementioned Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections via social media suddenly turned PMT techniques into the most closely watched domains, where everyone, from the media via congressional committees to national security services seemed to be ready to monitor and regulate this space. One can only hope that under such intense scrutiny the more ordinary threats envisioned by theory will have less chance to turn into reality.","We also have to be aware that much of the literature on the opportunities, threats and the actual use of PMT originates in the US. The reasons for that are obvious: US political campaigners have been developing PMT techniques since the early 2000s. Yet, as more than one contribution in this issue suggests, the PMT practices developed in the US do not enjoy universal appeal or success in other countries. As we discussed above, there are many factors that affect the applicability and effectiveness of particular PMT techniques, from the size of campaign budgets, via data protection rules, to the modalities of the political and media systems. As studies on actual PMT applications start to emerge from Brazil to Germany, it is high time to consider what parts of the US based theoretical discourse is applicable beyond the borders of the US political sphere. It would be a mistake to treat the US experience with PMT as a point each country will unavoidably pass in its teleological development of PMT-driven political communication. Instead, future research should carefully assess which of the opportunities and threats are the product of the particular, and rather exceptional US political, social, economic, cultural conditions, and what are the barriers in front of the global transfer of PMT practices, positive or negative effects, actors, knowledge, etc.","Moving beyond the state of play: the next generation of political micro-targeting research","Research on PMT is burgeoning. Put bluntly, PMT research suffers from an overdose of US perspectives, an underdose of European, South American, Asian perspectives, a too heavy reliance on interview data, and too much of mono-theoretical paradigms.","As outlined above there are good reasons why the US perspective is so dominant: many industry based developments are spearheaded in the US, the US electoral advertising industry is large and advanced, and the US has databases such as voter registration files which are game changers in terms of PMT. However, these very characteristics also make it problematic that so much of our knowledge is based in this single case. Most other western democracies (to allow for some comparative benchmark) have much smaller political advertising industries (limited by generally more modest campaign budgets), different political, electoral and media systems, and less accessible voter databases. This means that non-US studies, in particular comparative ones, are needed as the field moves forward so as to avoid basing our collective knowledge on a case which is exceptional (and thus abnormal) on many parameters.","Extant PMT research also suffers from heavy reliance on one type of studies. Whereas other areas of political communication research undoubtedly suffer from a strong reliance on content analyses, survey data or experimentation, the study of campaign techniques and the use of PMT relies too heavily on interview data. Such data are very informative and useful but typically reveal less information about the distribution of PMT, its usage, or let alone its effects. This is important since much of the public debate centers on assumptions about usage and effects. The prevalence of qualitative approaches is especially limiting because PMT could easily lend itself to big data based quantitative research methods. Having access to such datasets is an issue, and researchers should advocate transparency rules that enable such research (Bodo et al., 2017), but as a number of studies have proven, such quantitative approaches are not just feasible, but also shed light to phenomena invisible to qualitative methods (Puschmann, 2017).","Current PMT research also suffers from mono-theoretical blindness. Oftentimes the understanding and investigation of PMT provides only an overview of regulations, or focuses only on campaign practices or big data analytics. Too rarely are studies integrated such that different theoretical concepts, disciplines, and designs converge around answering PMT-related questions.","In this issue","This collection of papers comes out of the Personalised Communication project4 - an interdisciplinary project currently underway at the University of Amsterdam. It is the result of an international call for proposals, and subsequent international symposium held in Amsterdam on 22 September 2017. The symposium had the explicit aim of bringing researchers together from different disciplines and different political and media systems, all with an interest in PMT.","As we outlined above, we consider research PMT of eminent importance. On the one hand global players, such as digital platforms, agencies, consultants developed PMT based products and services in the US market, which they are now offering across the globe. On the other hand, there are more and more willing buyers among local politicians and parties, who are glad to test if PMT is able to deliver at least a fraction of its promised results. As the use of PMTs is slowly becoming the new normal in political communication, it is also pertinent that we, as scholars develop and refine the appropriate theories, research methods, and frames in which we can study PMT across different territories, jurisdictions, media and political systems, and compare our findings, before making bold claims about the effects and normative implications of PMT.","This special issue does not alleviate all of these potential concerns about PMT, and the research environment around PMT driven practices. Nevertheless, this selection of studies does offer bigger diversity of cases and foci. Most empirical papers are cognizant about regulatory and normative implications and vice versa. And while the prominence of interview based findings is not combatted in this issue either, papers rely on a wide variety of data.","The special issue includes four peer reviewed articles. They touch on broader industry regulations, and offer case studies and insights from diverse jurisdictions such as Brazil, Germany and the Netherlands. At the end of the special issue we include an abbreviated version of a speech delivered by MEP Sophie in ‘t Veld to Data & Democracy, a conference on political micro-targeting held in Amsterdam in May 2017, as well as a reflection by renowned political communication scholar and expert on political micro-targeting, Daniel Kreiss.","Jeff Chester and Kathryn Montgomery provide a much needed in depth insight into the current state of the industry that services political micro-targeting efforts in the US. Even if in a few years none of the firms mentioned in this article would remain, we believe we need a thorough overview of the state of play, the stakeholders and their claims, as they stood in late 2017, after the double, and rather unexpected shock of the surprise election of Donald Trump (in 2016!) and the vote for UK's exit of the European Union (June 2016!).","Mauricio Moura and Melissa Michelson’s empirical study on the effectiveness of different mobilisation efforts in Brazil serves as a useful reminder of why and how we should not take whatever we learn from the US experiences for granted. Due to its unregulated nature Whatsapp played a central role in the general elections in Brazil. Moura and Michelson’s study suggests that it has a strong impact when it comes to its ability to mobilise voters. Their study also reminds us that digital intermediaries can be used as a mass media as much as a personalised media.","Tom Dobber, Damian Trilling, Natali Helberger and Claes de Vreese’s account on the use of PMT techniques during the 2017 Dutch general elections highlights the fundamental differences between how PMT is regarded and used in the US and another, technologically and economically highly developed, but European country. To explain the strikingly lower appeal of PMT in the Netherlands, Dobber et al. make the first steps to outline the theoretical framework in which all factors that might affect local PMT applicability can be situated and assessed against each other.","Simon Kruchinski and André Haller look at use of PMT in the canvassing efforts of German parties during the 2016 state parliament elections in Rhineland-Palatinate. The authors introduce a framework of macro-, meso-, and micro level constraints that define the use, and usefulness of various PMT techniques in different countries. Using in-depth interviews they then identify the limited German parties’ use of PMT. They suggest that besides system-level, contextual factors such as budgetary restraints, and strict legal rules on data protection and privacy, the meso-, and micro level factors, such as the party structures and campaign knowledge, are also have a strong impact on the usefulness of micro-targeting.","At last, we invited two contributions from two leading voices on political micro-targeting. Daniel Kreiss is the leading scholar on the use PMT in the US political system. Sophie in 't Veld is a Dutch politician, Member of the European Parliament for Democrats 66, a Dutch liberal party. Their respective texts have the common concern for the future of democracy, in an era dominated by unchecked commercial influence over the political communication process, foreign meddling, and unaccountable, intransparent digital middlemen. But the differences between their perspectives, and analysis is as important as their shared anxieties, as they reflect the particular social, economic, political conditions in which these texts were born.","Kreiss sees PMT as a technology that reflects, reinforces and amplifies the partisan conflicts at the heart of US politics, the political agonism, the clash of competing social groups, interests, and values in the binary US political sphere. For him, the loss of the theoretical ideal of a rational debate between well informed citizens due to PMT is not much relevant in the context of the ideological war between the two opposing US parties. In t’ Veld, on the other hand, comes from the Netherlands, where 13 different parties make up the national parliament, another dozen are present in local legislatures, and works in the European Parliament where seven different party groups exist. For her, the deliberative aspects of democracy, and the negative effects PMT might have on those, are in the forefront.","The two closing opinions and the five peer reviewed studies are all based on a shared concern for democracy. Their differences in methods, topics, coverage and angle highlight the diversity of not just the issues at hand, but the much needed diversity of voices, this PMT research needs, if we are to understand the role of political micro-targeting in our democracies.","Bennet, C.

{"originalurl":"https://digiday.com/marketing/facebook-giving-brands-better-performance-data-ar-effects/amp/","title":"Facebook is giving brands better performance data on AR effects - Digiday","text":["Facebook is giving brands better performance data on AR effects","Facebook is giving advertisers more performance data on how people are using their augmented reality effects on the platform, as Snapchat steps up efforts to make its own AR more accessible to brands.","The Facebook update appeared on some agencies’ and developers’ AR development kits last week, but it isn’t yet widely available. Those who have seen it told Digiday there are three main updates: The first allows advertisers to see how many unique people used the lens; the second captures how many people took a photo using the lens; and the third allows advertisers to measure whether the effect has driven the user to take a specific action such as purchase, add to basket, view a webpage or install an app.","According to an updated dashboard viewed by Digiday, an AR effect for one advertiser was used more than 100,000 times over an eight-week period, 75 percent of which were organic. The effect contributed to around 10,000 orders, half of which occurred within a seven-day window, according to the dashboard.","Advertisement","Until now, brands that tested AR on the social network have only been able to see how many times their effects were used and how many views they generated. Brands view the lack of measurement as a minor issue rather than a big barrier to funding an AR effect, given the modest outlay required to create an effect in the first place. An AR effect is effectively a post that the brand itself develops using tools in Facebook’s AR Studio, or the brand can hire an AR developer to make an effect. The effects are not, however, ad units in the way that Snapchat’s branded lenses are sold to advertisers.","AR lenses on Snapchat typically cost between $500,000 and $1 million per day media agency executives have previously said. Whereas sources close to Snapchat claim advertisers can incorporate lenses into their paid campaigns for as little as $40,000. Regardless, pricing is dependent on factors such as targeting criteria and the timing of the lens, making it more comparable to a media buy than the branded-content play Facebook has touted to advertisers. As pricey as Snapchat’s AR play is, brands are still buying the lenses, and people are still using them. Over half of 13- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are using AR on Snapchat every week, according to the most recent figures shared by Peter Sellis, Snap’s director of product management for monetization, at Advertising Week Europe on March 19. Sellis acknowledged the challenges with the technology, however, noting that Snapchat’s AR lenses only reach about 15 percent of the U.S. population, per an eMarketer report.","“That doesn’t sound like the type of reach we’re going to need as advertisers to get AR in front of [more] people,” said Sellis, stressing how the company is trying to make lenses more accessible and pointing to the launch of its Lens Studio in December as the way it would drive reach. Pitched as a self-serve toolkit, advertisers can upload creative assets and create AR lenses on their own, which — in theory — would be faster than if they relied on Snapchat’s development team. Since the studio launched in December, it has had more than 30,000 submissions to and more than 1 billion views on lenses.","“I don’t think of AR as something we’re still figuring out,” said Sellis. “This isn’t 2015 when we’re learning if vomiting rainbows are beating flower crowns.” He added that the launch of World Lenses last October encapsulated the shift, with the business now pushing AR lenses for nearly everything, whereas before, it just focused on those that could be overlaid onto someone’s face. “We have a lot of the world’s most sophisticated advertisers working with AR today to achieve results across the entire funnel,” Sellis said. “Some of the world’s most sophisticated advertisers like Netflix and King are using AR to drive subscribers and downloads and activations.”","Snap, which pioneered AR on social media, will no doubt have one eye on Facebook’s rival service. Facebook is aggressively attempting to catch up to Snapchat in AR, opening up its beta program at the turn of the year following its launch to a limited number of partners in April. Earlier this month, Facebook introduced a feature that allows AR effects to be shown within its camera app when the camera is pointed at certain objects like the poster for a new movie, for example."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The conservative, voter-profiling organization at that point utilized their data to target Americans with customized hostile to Clinton and ace Trump purposeful publicity.","Donald Trump's impossible ascent to the administration looks dirtier and dirtier. In the most recent disclosure, Facebook declared on March 18 that University of Cambridge brain research speaker and St Petersburg college educator Dr Aleksandr Kogan \"deceived us and disregarded our Platform Policies by passing information from an application that was utilizing Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government, and military work the world over\".","As per previous Cambridge Analytica's parent organization SCL worker Christopher Wylie, Kogan gave information on more than 50 million Facebook profiles for Cambridge Analytica. Incidentally, Wylie, who had nothing in the same manner as his conservative supervisors - support investments extremely rich person Robert Mercer and Trump's key counsel Steve Bannon - was the person who thought of the programming, which empowered Trump's benefactors to utilize \"Facebook to collect a huge number of individuals' profiles. Furthermore, fabricated models to abuse what we thought about them and focus on their internal evil spirits. That was the premise the whole organization was based on.\"","In organization with Kogan's organization Global Science Research (GSR), they did that by making the application, \"thisisyourdigitallife\". This indicated to be an identity test that was charged as \"an examination application utilized by analysts\". It was utilized to spread independently focused on political publicity.","It was never simply the appropriate responses individuals provided for the test. The genuine crown gem was the open access it gave Cambridge Analytica to their Facebook accounts. As per Wylie, a huge number of Facebook clients took identity tests with the application. In doing as such, clients assented to their information being gathered for scholastic utilize. Its utilization was to demonstrate anything other than scholastic.","In the meantime, the application additionally accumulated the test-takers' Facebook companions' close to home data. This drove for more than 50 million clients' information being passed on to Cambridge Analytica. This is against Facebook's \"stage arrangement\" which restricted the accumulation of companions' information for publicizing or any reasons other than enhancing client encounter.","This information was then utilized, as Nix stated, to make \"individualized focused on and engagement advertisements\". The information was dissected to a limited extent with the Big 5 Personality Traits mental model, otherwise known as OCEAN V. The outcome, as indicated by Nix, may focus on a religious voter with 30 percent religious-tinted messages, 20 percent firearm rights messages, and 30 percent with monetary advertisements, while focusing on his NRA part neighbor with for the most part weapon rights messages on Facebook.","....","How effective would they say they were? There is no doubt that long range informal communication played a main consideration in the 2016 race. As indicated by Cambridge Analytica lead information researcher David Wilkinson, the organization exhorted Trump's battle to assign time and assets to country voters, particularly in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. This prompted Cambridge Analytica saying a while later, as indicated by an angry previous senior Trump innovation staff member, \"Look, I'm not saying they lied but rather for Cambridge Analytica to run triumph laps and claim they won the race for Trump is a tremendous distortion.\"","Possibly it wasn't that a lot of a distortion.","Many, including The New York Times, called the occurrence \"one of the biggest information spills in the interpersonal organization's history\" and a \"rupture\".","Facebook's general guidance Paul Grewal said in an announcement it was \"totally false\" to call the occurrence an \"information rupture,\" and undermined to sue the individuals who call it a break.","Protection scientist Sarah Jamie Lewis mockingly tweeted, \"Essentially Facebook empowered mass phishing of records in light of a guarantee designers wouldn't abuse that information.

Other technology giants have also sparked concern: Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all faced objections from users, the public and even government agencies.","Because all of these companies provide services relating to computers, there is a tendency to lump them together, calling them “Big Tech” or the “Frightful Five” or even “GAFA” – the acronym for the first four of them, leaving Microsoft out. Conceiving of “big tech” as a single industry makes the threat and influence overwhelming.","In the US, when an industry gets so large it exerts political pressure on society, people often label the industry as a whole, like “Big Oil,” “Big Tobacco” or “Big Pharma.” The so-called big tech companies certainly are big: In 2017, they were the top five most valuable public companies in the US But, as a scholar of the media marketplace that many of these firms are beginning to explore, I know that lumping them together hides the fact they’re very separate and distinct – not just as companies, but in terms of their business models and practices.","Understanding these companies in their proper business contexts makes it easier to understand their power in the marketplace and society at large. It also suggests ways to assess, regulate and manage that power to protect competition and even democracy itself.","Google: Advertising revenue from searches","Google and Facebook are most frequently discussed together, likely because of their domination of internet advertising. Together, the two companies collected 63 per cent of US digital advertising dollars in 2017. Both companies earn most of their revenue from advertising: 97 percent for Facebook and 88 percent for Google’s parent company Alphabet in 2016. But what they offer to advertisers and what users want from them are very different.","Google’s value proposition is helping users find things. Many – even most – of the 3.5 billion searches Google performs each day aren’t monetized at all. Google only gets paid if a searcher clicks on a paid link; the top three results are often labeled as “Ads,” in addition to several on the right side of a computer user’s search results screen.","Advertisers like Google because they only pay if their ads are clicked. That is a far better deal than what is offered in traditional media advertising, where payment is for how many people are shown an ad, rather than customers’ responses. In addition, Google’s position as a leading place where people look for information on products and services means an ad reaches a consumer exactly at the moment they’re looking for a product. This timing is more valuable than just showing ads to people in general – so much so that advertisers paid Google US$79.38 billion in 2016.","Facebook: Ad revenue from attention-grabbing content","Facebook operates more like a traditional ad-supported media company. It provides interesting content that attracts an audience, and sells their attention to advertisers – just as television, radio and print have done for decades. The key difference between Facebook and these legacy media businesses is where the content comes from: Rather than Facebook paying to create the material that draws users, the users add it themselves for free, posting personal messages and shared links.","Like traditional media, Facebook charges advertisers based on how many people see a message, not on how many take action by clicking. The value Facebook offers over traditional advertising is its ability to target very particular groups with a customized advertising message. This is precisely the type of targeting that happened during the 2016 US presidential election, which generated widespread public criticism.","Apple: Selling electronic hardware","In contrast to the advertising businesses of Google and Facebook, Apple remains a hardware technology company, deriving 84 percent of its 2016 revenue from the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers. The profits on those sales let Apple use very different strategies than the non-hardware companies with which it is often compared. The profit margins on each device are so substantial it doesn’t have to dominate the hardware market the way Google and Facebook control online advertising. Despite the seeming ubiquity of iPhones in some social circles, iPhones rarely top 20 per cent of worldwide phone sales, and account for about 30 per cent of US sales.","Apple has other elements to its business, too – such as its iTunes music distribution business. But it’s important to keep the relative scale of those elements in mind. Mostly, they are complementary businesses that Apple uses strategically in support of its primary focus as a hardware company. Taken together, iTunes, its App Stores, iBooks Store, Apple Music, Apple Care, Apple Pay and other even more ancillary sales added up to just 11 per cent of the company’s revenue in 2016. Even the company’s plan to spend $1 billion on original video is hard to understand, except as a support to branding and marketing efforts that boost its hardware sales.","Microsoft and Amazon: Mixed retail, computing and media","Much like Apple, Microsoft blends many revenue streams: It sells Surface computers, Azure cloud services, software (like the Microsoft Office Suite), gaming consoles and search engine advertising. The company once stood alone as a poster child for massive technology corporations. Lately, it may draw less attention because competitors like Google’s G Suite have challenged its market share. Also, Microsoft has not aggressively entered social media, a sector now under great scrutiny.","Finally, Amazon also operates in many different business sectors. Primarily, it is a goods retailer: That’s where 70 percent of its annual revenue came from in 2016. Its Amazon Web Services content hosting and cloud computing business contributed 9 per cent, and Amazon’s media businesses provided roughly 18 percent of the company’s $136 billion of annual revenue. That $24 billion of media revenue is nearly three times that of Netflix, but still not Amazon’s core business.","Regulate markets and behavior, not ‘tech’","It’s not that these companies are so different as to be unrelated or incomparable to each other. They all involve – to varying degrees – computers and services built on internet connection that provide services to customers in ways that never existed before. All five gather data on their users and analyze behavior using algorithms to create personal experiences in ways that are new and have been challenging for companies with long histories in sectors such as media, transportation or retail to match.","But despite simple perception of them all as “tech” companies, their core revenue sources are clearly different. And those distinctions suggest ways people can understand and respond to anxieties about their growing economic and cultural influence.","In fact, what is most concerning is the extent to which these companies aren’t in the same businesses: They’re not competing with each other, or really anyone else.","In prior eras, Americans learned that major industries they first viewed as innovators and economic saviors were more complicated and less magnanimous than initially believed. So now today, big tech isn’t unlike everything that came before. In fact, big tech isn’t really a thing at all.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

The social network just revamped its ad preference settings to make them significantly easier for users to understand. They’ve also launched a new ad education portal, which explains, in general terms, how Facebook targets ads.","“We want the ads people see on Facebook to be interesting, useful and relevant,” a Facebook spokesperson said.","But it remains to be seen whether users are pleased or frightened by the new information they suddenly have.","As explained on that shiny new portal, Facebook keeps ads “useful and relevant” in four distinct ways. It tracks your on-site activity, such as the pages you like and the ads you click, and your device and location settings, such as the brand of phone you use and your type of Internet connection. Most users recognize these things impact ad targeting: Facebook has repeatedly said as much. But slightly more surprising is the extent of Facebook’s web-tracking efforts and its collaborations with major data brokers.","While you’re logged onto Facebook, for instance, the network can see virtually every other website you visit. Even when you’re logged off, Facebook knows much of your browsing: It’s alerted every time you load a page with a “Like” or “share” button, or an advertisement sourced from its Atlas network. Facebook also provides publishers with a piece of code, called Facebook Pixel, that they (and by extension, Facebook) can use to log their Facebook-using visitors.","17.

Parents 28. Expectant parents 29. Mothers, divided by “type” (soccer, trendy, etc.) 30. Users who are likely to engage in politics 31. Conservatives and liberals 32. Relationship status","On top of that, Facebook offers marketers the option to target ads according to data compiled by firms like Experian, Acxiom and Epsilon, which have historically fueled mailing lists and other sorts of offline efforts. These firms build their profiles over a period of years, gathering data from government and public records, consumer contests, warranties and surveys, and private commercial sources — like loyalty card purchase histories or magazine subscription lists. Whatever they gather from those searches can also be fed into a model to draw further conclusions, like whether you’re likely to be an investor or buy organic for your kids.","When combined with the information you’ve already given Facebook, through your profile and your clicks, you end up with what is arguably the most complete consumer profile on earth: a snapshot not only of your Facebook activity, but your behaviors elsewhere in the online (and offline!) worlds.","33.

How much money user is likely to spend on next car 46. Where user is likely to buy next car 47. How many employees your company has 48. Users who own small businesses 49. Users who work in management or are executives","These snapshots are frequently incomplete and flawed, we should note — after all, they rely on lots of assumptions. But generally speaking, they’re good enough to have made Facebook an advertising giant. In the second quarter of 2016, the company made $6.4 billion in advertising, a number that’s up 63 percent from the year before. And now, Facebook ads aren’t only on Facebook.com and its acquired apps — they also populate an external Audience Network.","“Speaking as both a consumer and as an advertiser, I think that Facebook’s ad capabilities make internet advertising a better experience overall,” said Kane Jamison, a Seattle-based marketer who has written about his experience with Facebook ads. “The majority of promoted topics that I see in my Facebook feed are relevant to my interests, and they’re worth clicking on more often.”","Not everyone is quite so convinced that Facebook’s targeting methods are benevolent, though. Peter Eckersley, the chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, calls them “the most invasive in the world.”","Yes, he acknowledges, many companies use data brokers to make direct-mail lists, and almost every website utilizes some kind of tracker or cookies — but no company on earth, save Facebook, bundles all that information.","50.

Facebook actually sources data from IHS Automotive, an industry intelligence firm used widely by dealers, banks and financial analysts, and doesn’t need eavesdropping to know that your car’s 10 years old and you might be back in the auto market.","“Facebook’s business model is to amass as much first-party and third-party data on you as possible, and slowly dole out access to it,” Eckersley said. “If you’re using Facebook, you’re entrusting the company with records of everything you do. I think people have reason to be concerned about that.”","66. Users who are active credit card users 67. Credit card type 68. Users who have a debit card 69.

Users who buy allergy medications, cough/cold medications, pain relief products, and over-the-counter meds","Eckersley’s main concern is how much consumers know about all this tracking — and how much they’re able to opt out of it. Facebook says it’s been transparent on both counts, and that the revamped ad preferences dashboard, as well as the long-standing “Why Am I Seeing This Ad?’ dropdown, is only the latest proof that it’s dedicated to user privacy.","But while both the dashboard and the dropdown will rid you of ads you don’t like, neither actually lets users opt out completely of any of Facebook’s four tracking methods. The preferences manager, for instance, lets users tell Facebook they don’t have certain interests that the site has associated with them or their behavior, but there’s no way to tell Facebook that you don’t want it to track your interests, at all.","Likewise, Facebook allows users to opt-out of advertisements based on their use of outside websites and apps. But that doesn’t mean that Facebook never tracks those people when they’re on other sites, Eckersley said: It just limits some of its more all-seeing methods. And while Facebook did push its data-broker partners to adopt better privacy measures when it began working with them in 2013, each broker still requires you to file an opt-out request with them individually.","83.

Surely hell just froze over.","“It’s the paradox of modern life,” he laughed, adding that he needs the site to keep in touch with friends and family. “We’re strongly incentivized, by the culture around us, to use this technology.

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Facebook would prefer that its members enter it directly, thank you very much.","On Wednesday, Facebook filed a complaint against Power.com in United States District Court in San Jose, Calif., accusing it of copyright and trademark infringement, unlawful competition and violation of the computer fraud and abuse act, among other things. “Facebook has suffered irreparable and incalculable harm,” the complaint reads (here’s a PDF). Power.com removed access to Facebook from its site after Facebook filed the complaint.","Power.com screen shot.","Power.com asks users to provide their user names and passwords for social networks. It then enters those outside sites as if it were the user and allows the user to view the other site’s pages without actually visiting them. The company raised $2 million from angel investors, including the technology analyst Esther Dyson, and $6 million from the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson.","“After discussing the issues with Power.com for about a month without reaching a resolution, we filed a lawsuit to enforce our terms of service, maintain the integrity of our site and to assure our users’ privacy and security are protected,” said Barry Schnitt, a Facebook spokesman.","Steve Vachani, the founder of Power.com, said his company had been “in discussions with Facebook to get their feedback on the best ways to work with them.”","According to Facebook’s complaint, Power.com “is offering a product that solicits, stores and uses Facebook login information to access information stored on Facebook computers without authorization and to display Facebook copyrighted material without permission.”","Power.com also sent misleading e-mail advertisements to the friends of Facebook users, according to the complaint. They bore return addresses that ended with “facebookmail.com” and said that they had come from “The Facebook Team.”","Facebook has requested that Power.com use Facebook Connect, a service that allows Facebook users to access their Facebook identity and group of friends from other sites without giving their log-in information to those sites.","“By offering Facebook Connect, Facebook enables users to integrate with other sites without compromising Facebook’s commitment to safeguard its users’ privacy and security,” the complaint said. “Facebook does not permit third-party access to Facebook user profile data unless such third parties use Facebook Connect.”","In November, Mr. Vachani told The Times that Power.com would not anger the operators of social networks because it did not lift content from their sites but instead reached them after a user had voluntarily entered his or her log-in information.","This week, he said that Power.com was working to adopt Facebook Connect by the end of January.","“Power.com is focused on providing value-added services to social network users, and it is not necessary for us to store the user’s name and password if a site prefers that we don’t,” he said. Power.com is building its own version of Facebook Connect, he said, which will be called Social InterConnect and “will allow users to freely share their account information for any site with any other site, without the host site needing to store the user name and password.”","Before filing the complaint, Facebook tried several times to stop Power.com from using its site without authorization. It first complained on Dec. 1, when Power.com started publicizing its site in the United States. On Dec. 12, according to the complaint, Mr. Vachani responded that Power.com would implement Facebook Connect in two weeks. He later asked for an extension, and on Dec. 26 said he would continue to gain access to Facebook in what Facebook deemed to be an unauthorized manner.","Mr. Vachani said that Power.com did not cooperate at first because “we didn’t want to interrupt the service.

I use it, but I’m not enamored of some of its more heavy-handed tactics. And I agree with poster #1 that it’s quite hypocritical of the site to collect your logins from external sites but not allow external sites to collect your Facebook login. Facebook also frequently issues warnings about misuse of the site but completely refuses to tell you what the rules are, so that you can never know whether you are “close” to violating them or not. Just send “too many” emails (no one knows what the allowable maximum is) and you will find your account frozen. I don’t know why they don’t just announce the limits up front.","Ok… then Yahoo, MSN, hotmail should politly request that Facebook stop soliciting their paswords as well then, “thank you very much”. I never understood how a Brazilian company can be sued in the US courts if they have no offices here. Perhaps they should just tell them, “bugger off, thank you very much”.","The example email in the complaint is identical to other Facebook event invites I’ve received, with the exception of the event information and the unique identifier codes that are different in every email Facebook sends.","I highly suspect that this WAS an actual email sent by Facebook to notify users of an event invitation that was possibly sent without users’ permission. I have many similar emails in my inbox right now, and all are signed, “The Facebook Team,” even if the event is sponsored by another group or company. Even if Power.com used Facebook to send unsolicited messages to its users, that’s what the complaint should have said. If Power.com did generate that message instead of sending it through Facebook, Facebook should have acknowledged that it sends out many emails exactly like that for other sponsored groups all the time, and all are signed, “The Facebook Team,” so that would be an attempt to impersonate mail coming from Facebook. Even the RSVP link in the message is an event link back to a Facebook “event.” There’s something verrrrry fishy about pages 11-12 of this complaint.","Facebook is acting like a monopoly. It doesn’t matter if a Power offers additional value, it is also erodes FB’s control.","I had a similar experience with Microsoft, in the 90’s. We allowed anyone to try any software package according for a limited time without special version or install. Every major software company signed up, except Microsoft, which for some reason didn’t *want* people to try before you buy ;-)","Wrong. Facebook does not REQUIRE you to give your email login information. It is only one service you can use if you want to simply invite everyone in your address book to join your profile. What Facebook does with that info I cannot say, since I chose NOT to use it. But it is not required of anyone to give that information over.","I wouldn’t feel bad if Facebook lost out on some revenue, I am a little annoyed by the social networking hype anyway. I do see its advantages, but some things are just over tte top, such as 1500 “friends” or 1200 photos. I mean, really","Facebook’s suit looks ok to me. But Yahoo, MSN, hotmail probably have similarly actionable rights against facebook.\nI think each site to which such parasites attach themselves must make its own determination as to whether (a) the parasite adds value for the user; (b) the parasite adds value to their site; and (c) whether the conduct of the parasite is likely to make the value it adds worth the hassle and the risks the connection causes for the original site.","If I were Facebook, I certainly would feel my business to be threatened by Power.com.","same site like this was previously Powerkut.com and sites like these would come into picture now and often until ppl keep visiting these banned sites like FB/ ORKT from workplaces.","If its ok for FB to use the data from sites like gmail, hotmail or yahoo mail how can they prevent users from accessing their own data thru web from any other resource.","Actually FB is just keeping data, users are interested in accessing it, say may be from FBook or if they like access many social n/w websites like orkut/ myspace/hi5/classmates.com……………the list unending and users want more.","Ever notice how the corporate types love to hide behind terms like “to assure our users’ privacy and security are protected” to cover their greed. If power.com has someone’s Facebook account details, it’s because it was given willingly and freely by the legitimate account holder. Power.com is simply trying to be social network aggregator, as is Facebook. BTW, I wouldn’t touch either because I really don’t want my privacy to be in the hands of any corporation. And, yes, I flush my google cookies too.","Power.com does nothing clever. Facebook offers an ability for it to do much of what they want using Facebook Connect. Power.com is probably shooting itself in the foot by not using this method, as it isn’t likely they’ll find any court that endorses a services using screen scraping and asking users to give up identity details, in many cases in breach of the ToS."],"isopubdate":"2009-01-02"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

But This One Is Different.","text":["Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has everything: peculiar billionaires, a once-adored startup turned monolith, a political mercenary who resembles a Bond villain and his shadowy psychographic profiling firm, an eccentric whistleblower, millions of profiles worth of leaked Facebook data, Steve Bannon, the Mercers, and — crucially — Donald Trump, and the results of the 2016 presidential election.","On its face, the incident read as confirmation of many people’s worst fears — that the online platforms we live on are manipulating us, using the personal information we provided in good faith without our knowledge. Add to it that one of those many unintended outcomes could have been Donald Trump’s election and you’ve got the makings of a lasting outrage.","While the main players in the scandal — Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Trump — will occupy headlines, they’re just the context — the perfect conditions for genuine outrage. But the Cambridge Analytica scandal isn’t really about Cambridge Analytica at all.","This is a data collection scandal. This is a scandal triggered by a specific incident, but that is broadly about the ways massive companies track us, harvest information from us, and then sell us as coercion targets in sophisticated information campaigns that could be for anything from diapers to mattresses to anti-vax literature.","The story will endure not because of animosity toward political data use but because it perfectly touches upon a deeper anxiety about our online privacy that’s been building for years. Indeed, the Cambridge Analytica scandal could well be the catalyst for a much bigger targeting revolt — a full-scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we’ve used the internet for the last decade. It’s a moment that forces us, collectively, to step back and think about what we sacrificed for a more convenient and connected world. And on an internet that feels increasingly toxic it’s hard to look at the tradeoffs we’ve made and feel like we’re getting a fair deal.","2. This is every place I have been in the last twelve months in Ireland, going in so far as the time of day I was in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT","You can see this reckoning already begin play out across the media as the focus shifts from Cambridge Analytica’s deeds to more general concerns about privacy and the degree to which our personal lives are catalogued so that we can be targeted by anyone with a dollar (or ruble) to spend online. Over the weekend, Ars Technica reported that Facebook has long requested access to contacts, SMS data, and call history on Android devices, hiding behind a confusing opt-in page as cover.","On Twitter, Facebook users are downloading their data and combing through it to highlight various abuses of trust: that the company kept a record of private phone calls and text message data or that Facebook shared personal information with outside entities for ad purposes. Download your own Facebook, Google, and YouTube data and you'll find years’ worth of personal information: every photo, comment, sticker emoji, video you've ever posted online; every location you’ve visited and IP address you’ve logged in from; every search, every file, and every single website you visited. It's binary confirmation of something we perhaps all have silently suppressed. Every movement you make online — and even where you move about in the world — is fastidiously catalogued, analyzed, and ultimately sold.","Ok @Google. I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway. See recent videos I watched! I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS? 😖😡🤬 https://t.co/NdJqEYfQIV","In the wake of this revolt, a 2010 clip of Steve Jobs talking about privacy has found new resonance in recent days. In an interview with journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, Jobs is asked to weigh in on a then-recent Facebook scandal and lays out his feelings on user privacy, as Mark Zuckerberg looks on in the audience. “Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly,” he says. “I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.”","Today, the clip is presented as a face-to-face warning from Jobs to Zuckerberg and as proof of sorts that Facebook knew exactly what sort of surveillance tools it was building. Indeed, Facebook’s history of privacy scandals makes the current revelations feel all the more flagrant.","In 2007, Zuckerberg first apologized for its controversial Beacon ad program, which tracked purchases on outside sites and posted that information onto a user’s News Feed. “Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. Three years later, in a sweat-filled interrogation at another D conference, Zuckerberg repeatedly dodged direct questions about Facebook’s cavalier attitudes toward privacy. More than 11 years after Beacon, Facebook is still behaving recklessly with our personal information and still making the same apologies — the only difference is that this time the advertising systems are far more complicated and the apologies come in full-page ads in the New York Times.","The Great Targeting Revolt isn’t just about the platforms; some in the ad industry are coming clean too. On Sunday the Verge published an editorial by a former digital marketer suggesting that Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the iceberg. “The contemporary Internet runs on the exploitation of user data,” the author wrote, before citing examples of corporations flagrantly flaunting user privacy to extract data. It may seem obvious but the revelation is profound and the language is important. Marketing is passive but targeting is active and invasive. A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted. Cambridge Analytica, the piece argues, isn’t an outlier but the blueprint for the internet’s vast online ad economy.","A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted.","Now in its second week, the size of the scandal is still unclear. We know that data obtained by a researcher was improperly shared with political consultants and that Cambridge Analytica did not delete the data upon Facebook’s request, but there’s a whole lot we don’t know for sure. Is this sort of improper data sharing an isolated incident or is this just part of a systemic information-control problem inside Facebook? Did the data get passed around to data brokers, states, or other companies besides SCL and Cambridge Analytica? Was the specific profile data used in any way to help target voters in the 2016 election? More importantly, is this data actually as useful in persuading voters as the targeting firms would have us believe? And are the people at Cambridge Analytica the psychographic targeting evil geniuses they claim to be? Or is it all just a bunch of bullshit — less “mindfuck tool” and more midlevel marketing?","There’s evidence to suggest that the Cambridge Analytica team were, at the very least, likely overselling their influence. “When we first saw the pitch the first thought was ‘Why would I pay all this money for this stuff when I could just get our guy from Facebook to do this kind of thing for us?’” a former senior Trump campaign official told BuzzFeed News. And some researchers and psychologists are dubious about the effectiveness of the Facebook data in political ad targeting. Speaking to Wired UK, one researcher argued that psychographic profiling is light on actual science. Another professor who studied voter behavior inside Facebook between 2010 and 2015 told the publication that the Facebook data gathered through questionnaires like Cambridge Analytica’s “may not measure what you really care about” and could have actually corrupted the ad targeting data the company had previously collected.","But none of that may matter much anymore at this point. The scandal feels like a watershed moment no matter how effective Cambridge Analytica may have been. Not only has the outrage endured more than a full week of news cycles, but it seems now as if in it the Big Tech backlash has reached a critical mass, sparking an unprecedented crisis. It’s caught the eye of lawmakers across the world — Zuckerberg has been summoned by Parliament in the UK and asked to testify in Congress by multiple senators; Facebook is now under an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission about its mishandling of Cambridge Analytica data; and across the world, company executives are getting skewered by governments in nations like the UK and, worse, Singapore, where officials suggest the company has lost their trust. It’s prompted more direct talk — even from Zuckerberg himself — of regulation. Anti-monopoly advocates are calling on the FTC to restructure Facebook, suggesting a spinoff of Facebook’s ad network and even the reversal of the company’s WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions to make them competing social networks. It even appears that inside Facebook itself there’s confusion and a sense of dwindling morale. And while the blowback isn’t enough to unseat Facebook in the App Store, regular, loyal Facebook users around the world have put momentum behind a #DeleteFacebook campaign — a novel act of online rebellion despite plenty of previous privacy scandals.","Some news events unexpectedly break through and take on new lives and trigger genuine, lasting movement. Moments like these are impossible to predict or control. The Parkland school shooting this February wasn’t an outlier in terms of casualties or sheer scale of horror and yet that particular tragedy’s aftermath was a breaking point and prompted a full-throated rejection of the status quo. The Parkland students were simply fed up. Fed up with the notion of not having control over their own safety. Fed up with a system in which victims of gun violence seemingly have no agency.","While the situations are drastically different, the frustration at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is similarly about agency and control. For years we’ve read about privacy scandals from the NSA’s Prism program to the data breaches everywhere from Equifax to Ashley Madison. We’re no stranger to the warnings that the platforms we live on harvest our data and that every detail of our online activities acts as the oil that powers the internet’s economic engine and that there’s little we can do, save for opting out completely. But this one lays bare the downsides of this tradeoff — how, despite their pledge to empower us, the platforms we live on have done just the opposite and stripped us of the agency to dictate what happens with our most personal information. Maybe it’s because Facebook feels so personal or because the 2016 election was so divisive, but this scandal is shaping up to be the event that forces the scales to fall from our eyes. We’ve lost control. And we’re fed up.","Every revolution needs to be ignited. Cambridge Analytica feels a lot like a spark.","If you want to read more about Facebook’s data scandal,subscribe to Infowarzel, a BuzzFeed News newsletter by the author of this piece, Charlie Warzel.","Charlie Warzel is a Senior Technology Writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in Missoula, Montana"],"isopubdate":""}
