To the most frequently asked question – yes SCL/CA works in India and has offices there. This is what modern colonialism looks like,” Wylie tweeted.","I’ve been getting a lot of requests from Indian journalists, so here are some of SCL’s past projects in India.

SCL undertook a behavioural research programme targeting over 75 per cent of households to assist the client in not only identifying the correct battlegrounds, but also the right audiences, messages and most importantly the right castes to target with their campaigns,” Wylie’s document notes.","The JD (U) went on to win the 2010 state elections as part of an alliance with the NDA.","Wylie’s document also showed caste census and caste research campaigns carried out in Uttar Pradesh in 2011-2012 on behalf of a “national party”.","“The research included analysis of caste structure and dynamics within the state leading to conclusions regarding the identification of the party’s core voters as well as likely swing voters,” it claims.","Other aspects of the document cover the company’s work across different states including during the 2003 Rajasthan election for a “major state party”; Madhya Pradesh in 2003 for a “national party” to identify swing voters; a full political survey for a “major party” during the 2007 Uttar Pradesh elections; and managing the campaigns of a number of Lok Sabha candidates for the 2009 national elections.","“Our services help clients to identify and target key groups within the population to effectively influence their behaviour to realise a desired outcome,” the SCL India material claims.","It also highlights some work on countering “recruitment into and support of” violent Jihadism in the states of Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and UP in 2007, in support of a trans-national programme for countering non-desired behaviour (NDB).","The House of Commons’ committee investigation into fake news will resume next month after the Parliament’s Easter recess, when a senior Facebook executive is expected to give evidence on what the social media giant knew about the alleged misuse of its data by CA."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Live Tiles flash and move. A nice assistant named Cortana always hovers nearby. Click on the wrong spot and you could be whisked away elsewhere on the Web. And there are always people asking who you are, where you live, what you like...","Because the latest version of Windows is always asking for information in the guise of being helpful, it’s easy to think that Microsoft’s the poster child for the collective attack on your digital privacy. But it’s not.","This is the price of free: free email, free operating systems, free connecting with friends, free search. And while Microsoft has thrown itself on the ground, begging for forgiveness, you can make the argument that other companies are doing as much or more to mine your data. Let’s take a look.","Facebook","“...Facebook trackers are just about everywhere on the Internet. But because most of Facebook’s 1.49 billion users routinely access the service through an app, the ads cannot be hidden using one of the many blocker tools now topping the download charts on Apple’s App Store.” - Bloomberg","At this point, Facebook represents its own self-contained ecosystem. Want to share baby pictures? Ping a friend to meet up after work? Chances are that you’re making those connections on Facebook—connections that Facebook knows and can exploit for its gain.","Mark Hachman","Track your own history with Facebook’s Activity Log.","The latest? Facebook is now pitching a program by which advertisers can market their products across TV and Facebook as a unified whole, so that a trailer for the latest James Bond movie, for example, might run at halftime of “Monday Night Football”—or on news feeds of users who have “liked” a previous Bond flick. And if that’s not enough, advertisers will also gain the power to poll you about what you thought of them.","What information does Facebook collect? It’s no secret that there’s little “privacy” in Facebook’s privacy policy. Here’s a snippet:","“We collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide, such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. We also collect information about how you use our Services, such as the types of content you view or engage with or the frequency and duration of your activities.”","Facebook knows your friends, what information you provide about them, what they say about you, what other sites you visit (if they include a Facebook “like” button, which most do), what you bought, what device you used to access Facebook, and much more.","What can I do about it? It’s an amazing amount of information, although you can download it all right here, using Facebook’s Download Your Information tool. You can also check your Activity Log to see exactly what you’ve done since you’ve joined the service. Note that the latter choice is far less complete than the Download Your Information tool. You can also delete your account, but Facebook reserves the right to keep information that others have shared about you. Because to Facebook, that information isn’t yours.","Google","Google has become the de facto name in search (although I’ve since switched to Bing) and Gmail, Google Maps, and its other services now rank among the leaders in those categories. But all that “free” adds up to a huge amount of your personal information being traded away to create personalized, targeted ad experiences.","The latest? Google has launched a program by which your profile is now keyed to your email address. Dubbed Customer Match, the program ensures that an advertiser’s “brand is right there, with the right message, at the moment your customer is most receptive,” Google promises. So if you’ve previously asked a travel site to send information to your Gmail address, that site can sign up for Customer Match. Then when you’re watching YouTube, that site “can show ads that inspire them to plan their next trip.”","Google buries information about what you do on the Web all over this place, including your Search History. But does anyone ever bother digging it up?","What information does Google collect? As with Facebook, there’s a ton: name, email address, telephone number, credit card (if you enter it), details on how you use Google’s services, how you interact with other websites that use AdWords and other Google technologies, your device, search queries—the list goes on and on. Google will also store information in your browser via local browser storage—that goes beyond the snippets of code commonly referred to as “cookies”.","And if your information is “public,” it’s fair game. “If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo,” the policy states.","If there’s one thing that I don’t see in Google’s privacy policy, it’s a portion that’s specific to Android.","Apple","The latest? The news surrounding Apple isn’t so much how it’s using your data, but how it’s preventing content companies from having the same access. Its controversial ad blocking technology built into the latest version of iOS 9 has roiled the advertising and media world alike. Part of this, of course, is that Apple makes the majority of its sales on hardware and app sales—not advertising—so it can take the high road.","Mark Hachman","Here’s how to turn off ad tracking in iOS9...","What information does Apple collect? Apple’s “privacy policy” can be summed up in three words: “We’re for it.” The policy doesn’t do a great job explicitly listing what information it collects, most of it goes into more detail into what it doesn’t collect. In all fairness, Apple appears to do a good job linking your preferences to an intermediary, anonymous series of ID numbers (sometimes linked to the Siri digital assistant) rather than “knowing” it is you.","Mark Hachman","...and in iTunes.","Apple does say, however, that it will collect certain information such as your name, contacts, and songs in your music library, and send them to Apple servers using encrypted protocols.—including your location, if that service is turned on. And your iPhone sends your anonymized location and calendar information, so it can predict when you’ll have to leave to make your next appointment. Apple Music also links your preferences to an anonymous ID, and the News app uses your reading preferences to supply ads within the app.","What can I do about it? For all of its holier-than-thou attitude towards advertising, Apple doesn’t put the process to opt out of targeted advertising front and center. Time and again, Apple says that you can reset the identifier it uses to link you to the content you want to see, or opt out; however, that process is left to the user to discover for himself or herself.","Microsoft","Microsoft’s a bit different than Facebook, for example, in that it owns your operating system as well as its associated services. That means that it can peer into your OS and discover that a particular graphics driver was at fault, as the company pointed out in a blog post on Monday. During the runup to Windows 10, I complained about a driver issue (specifically a borked Intel 802.11ac W-Fi driver) on Twitter. Coincidentally or not, I was pushed a new driver the next day.","Mark Hachman","Allowing Microsoft to see what’s inside your PC isn’t always the worst idea, as updates can be tailored to your PC’s particular hardware.","Microsoft admits to collecting information to personalize your experience, but says it does not scan your email to collect that. “Unlike some other platforms, no matter what privacy options you choose, neither Windows 10 nor any other Microsoft software scans the content of your email or other communications, or your files, in order to deliver targeted advertising to you,” Microsoft senior vice president Terry Myerson wrote in a blog post.","What information does Microsoft collect? Microsoft also does a good job comprehensively spelling out what information it collects: name and contact data, credentials, demographic data, payment data, and more. But don’t buy the line that Microsoft doesn’t read your email—the privacy policy states very clearly that it does. It not only reads the subject line and body of an email, but also the text or other content of an instant message, the audio and video recording of a video message, and the audio recording and transcript of a voice message you receive or a text message you dictate. It just doesn’t sell ads against it.","There’s also an additional layer of input that Microsoft samples, because it is an OS.","If you’d like, you can turn features like Cortana off.","“Additionally, your typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you a personalized user dictionary, help you type and write on your device with better character recognition, and provide you with text suggestions as you type or write. Typing data includes a sample of characters and words you type, which we scrub to remove IDs, IP addresses, and other potential identifiers. It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text as well as words you’ve added to the dictionary.”","PCWorld","Hey, fair’s fair, right? We can’t really criticize other sites’ privacy policies without publishing our own as well. Note that PCWorld uses cookies to help identify you—and if you’ve logged in, you’ll receive a more optimized experience. But if you don’t log in, that’s fine too.","And yes, you can use an ad blocker or an anonymizer service with no penalty and still receive our news and features. Other sites allow limited access with anonymization turned on—you can still see public Facebook pages, for example, but there’s no way you’ll see anyone’s Gmail page without the proper login and password.","Yes, your privacy is for sale","One of Robert A. Heinlein’s most famous contributions to popular culture was an acronym: TANSTAAFL—There Ain’t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. That certainly goes for today’s online services. Bing, Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and the like—they may not cost you a dime, but they’re not free.

What the CEO needs to do is fix Facebook first","The imagination attempts to conjure a dream state in which Mark Zuckerberg emerges from the Facebook fiasco, forgiven and rebooted.","The imagination fails.","When he took Facebook public in 2012, Mark Zuckerberg said it would help transform society for the future. He didn’t say what kind of future. (Noah Berger / AP FILE PHOTO)","Zuckerberg, asked yet again to appear before the U.K.’s parliamentary committee hearings into the Cambridge Analytica scandal, once again declined, a brazen demonstration of hubris at a time when British parliamentarians are struggling to understand how the harvesting of data from 50 million Facebook users might have been manipulated to advance the Vote Leave campaign.","Precisely when did Facebook become aware of the data harvesting? That question has re-emerged in the wake of Tuesday’s testimony from whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, and is one that Zuckerberg should answer directly. And precisely what did Facebook do in the face of the breach to ensure that the data scraping had ceased? Ditto.","Where do we look for comparisons? There are none that size in scale to the exit from the European Union, not even, arguably, the election of Donald Trump.","Here’s something: Zuckerberg now has taken the request to appear before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on April 10 with the seriousness it deserves. News reports suggest that he has committed to appearing personally and will not be sending a Number Two. So we will get to see the wunderkind live, grilled, one hopes, as energetically as past CEOs before Congressional hearings. Jeff Skilling (Enron) comes to mind. Or that unfortunate Mr. Stumpf (Wells Fargo).","Too harsh?","Explain, please, how the Facebook drama is different in substance from what lies at the heart of corporate scandals from the dawn of time: greed.","Article Continued Below","The only distinguishing feature I can see is that 2.2 billion Facebook users are trapped within it, bleating that they will lose their friends, not to mention those distant relations in the Outer Hebrides, once they disconnect. (Disclosure: I have triggered my exit request from Facebook, which I only joined in the first place because the corporate masters ordered it, though what was to be gained by the Star by launching these “professional” Facebook pages remains a mystery. What Facebook got was clear: stuff about me!)","Zuckerberg’s initial strategy of staying silent has not played well for him, as it has never played well for anybody, ever.","As predicted, and first reported by the Washington Post, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is officially investigating the social media giant. The FTC’s terse confirmation release Monday was a reminder of its role in protecting the privacy of consumers and in taking enforcement action against companies that fail to honour their privacy promises.","I documented here last week the FTC’s prior action against Facebook, filing an eight-count complaint against the company in 2009. That timing is key. Nine years ago Facebook was still a privately owned company with revenues of $777 million (U.S.), a lilliputian sum when weighed against the company’s 2017 revenues of $40 billion-plus, a $14-billion increase from the year prior.","In 2009, Zuckerberg was a twenty-something corporate neophyte with ambitions to do good in the world by building a global network of social connectivity. It’s tempting to allow the veil of innocence to shroud that chapter in Facebook’s history.","But it’s worth rereading that FTC complaint in the context of deceptive privacy promises and, especially, unfair and deceptive privacy changes. In November 2009, when Facebook changed its privacy policy to redesignate certain private user information as publicly available, it did so through a notification to users pitched as “making some changes to give you more control of your information and help you stay connected.”","Sounds positive, right? Instead, the FTC alleged in its complaint, users were not informed that choosing to share a friend list with “Only Friends” would be overridden, “and that this information would be made accessible to the public.” Listen to this: “Facebook’s designation of PAI (publicly available information) caused harm to users, including, but not limited to, threats to their health and safety, and unauthorized revelation of their affiliations.”","That just gives you a taste of what was going on with the metastatic social network before it went public and before it became world beating.","And advertisers? The FTC itemized numerous examples where Facebook pledged that personal information would never be shared with advertisers. “We never sell your personal information to anyone,” the company said. Here’s what the FTC said: “Specifically, from at least September 2008 until May 26, 2010, Facebook designed and operated its web site such that, in many instances, the User ID for a user who clicked on a Platform Ad was shared with the Platform Advertiser.”","In settling with the FTC, Facebook agreed to a number of terms, including being “barred from making misrepresentations about the privacy or security of consumers’ personal information” and was henceforth “required to obtain consumers’ affirmative express consent before enacting changes that override their privacy preferences.”","Sure, the story fast-forwards through years of doing the wrong thing, and then fixing the wrong thing, and then doing the wrong thing again.","The sole person answerable for that is Zuckerberg himself.","When he took the company public in 2012 with that vaunted mission statement, Zuckerberg said Facebook would help transform society for the future. He didn’t say what kind of future. What didn’t leap to mind was a manipulative, politically interfering, fear-mongering future.","I suspect that the fearless leader will have to do more now than make himself available and answerable. He will have to propose some new mechanics, independently managed, that will assure investors that the company is, at last, as good as its word.","More from The Star & Partners","LOADING","Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Ted Cruz insisted Tuesday that he was unaware of any impropriety.","The Cruz presidential campaign touted its collaboration with Cambridge Analytica as a sign of a cutting edge run for the White House, allowing the Texan to carefully identify likely supporters. The firm shifted allegiance to Donald Trump once the Texan dropped out of the GOP primaries.","Both campaigns pumped millions into the company, controlled by billionaire Robert Mercer — a key patron first of Cruz and then Trump in 2016.","\"They assured us the claims made in the press were false,\" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Tuesday.","She said the campaign's contract with the firm included explicit assurances \"that all data used by them were obtained legally, that they would conduct their operations 'in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,' and that they 'hold all necessary permits, licenses and consents to conduct its operations.' The campaign relied upon those representations.\"","And she said, Cambridge Analytica reiterated those assurances after the reports in late 2015. Critics of the firm, including whistleblower Christopher Wylie, a data scientist who worked for Cambridge Analytica, have long questioned the firm's methods.","\"It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with the psychology of an entire country ... in the context of the democratic process,\" Wylie told The Guardian. \"It is a full service propaganda machine.\"","Texas Democrats blasted Cruz on Monday for benefiting from a \"massive invasion of privacy\" and demanded that Cruz explain when he knew the company had engaged in \"deceitful activity.\"","\"Ted Cruz will stop at nothing to weasel his way into power, even if it means weaponizing stolen information to manipulate people to like him,\" Texas Democratic Party deputy executive director Manny Garcia said in a news release. \"Cruz's campaign exploited personal information to create psychological profiles on millions of Americans. All to keep lining the pockets of Cruz's billionaire super PAC donors — like Robert Mercer, who funded this propaganda machine.\"","Frazier declined a request for comment Monday. On Tuesday, she said in a written statement: \"The campaign hired Cambridge Analytica as a vendor to assist with data analysis and online advertising. The campaign's data analysis program followed and built upon the successful data-modeling and micro-targeting approach pioneered by the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012.\"","Cruz faces a Senate challenge in the fall from Rep. Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso Democrat. Federal campaign records show no sign of Cruz campaign ties with Cambridge Analytica since mid-2016.","Questions about the firm","In July 2015, Rick Tyler, then a spokesman for Cruz, said the campaign used the data to identify potential voters by six personality types.

The personal data at issue was harvested by an academic researcher who then provided it to the firm in violation of Facebook's terms of service.

What you can do is rely on data,\" Roe said.","He didn't respond to an interview request on Monday.","At the time, the Cruz campaign had spent just $750,000 with Cambridge Analytica, and the firm reportedly had staffers embedded at the Cruz campaign's headquarters in Houston.","As the Post reported: To develop its psychographic models, Cambridge surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored individuals using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. A top Cambridge official didn't respond to a request for comment, but Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said.","The Cruz campaign modified the Cambridge template, renaming some psychological categories and adding subcategories to the list, such as \"stoic traditionalist\" and \"true believer.\" The campaign then did its own field surveys in battleground states to develop a more precise predictive model based on issues preferences.","The Cruz algorithm was then applied to what the campaign calls an \"enhanced voter file,\" which can contain as many as 50,000 data points gathered from voting records, popular websites and consumer information such as magazine subscriptions, car ownership and preferences for food and clothing.","Ending the relationship","It's unclear when Cruz stopped working with Cambridge Analytica.","Some news accounts indicate that his campaign stopped using the firm's data after the South Carolina primary in late February 2016, though federal campaign records show more than $670,000 in payments to the firm for \"media/voter modeling\" or \"voter ID targeting/web service\" in March and June, plus $218,000 for \"media\" and \"digital service/web service.\"","In March 2017 — long after Cruz ended his presidential bid — Tyler said Cambridge data had proven unreliable. The Times reported that \"in one early test, more than half the Oklahoma voters whom Cambridge had identified as Cruz supporters actually favored other candidates.\"","It also is possible that the intense profiling of individual voters became less relevant or feasible once the contest expanded beyond the small states where retail-style campaigning is paramount — Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2IBKHco?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.3f0232c3cbfd","title":"U.S. and European officials question Facebook’s protection of personal data - The Washington Post","text":["U.S. and European officials on Sunday called for Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how personal information about tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm that worked for President Trump’s 2016 campaign — without the permission or knowledge of the vast majority of those affected.","News reports about Facebook’s role in the aggressive form of data collection also have raised serious questions about whether the company violated a landmark consent decree with a federal watchdog agency designed to prevent privacy violations. Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work — including a former Cambridge Analytica employee — said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what “like” buttons they had hit.","“In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,” the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook’s concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump’s digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user- ­experience researcher, according to Facebook’s public website.","Some critics said Facebook’s actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump’s campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Cambridge Analytica — which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president’s former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon — has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its “psychometric profiles” could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company’s actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain’s information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data “may have been illegally acquired and used.”","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. “It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 E.U. referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee that is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.E.U., a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook’s processes for dealing with developers who broke the company’s rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules — usually because of a story in the news — the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook “relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,” Parakilas said. “During my 16 months at the company, I don’t recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.”","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","“Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,” said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook’s actions on Saturday, including if it ran afoul of its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of its agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry into U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge’s “psychographic targeting” techniques — including its use of Facebook data — with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of Cambridge’s work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers’ likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge’s work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm’s data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign’s data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump’s strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge’s parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in “soft power,” or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO’s Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia’s influence in the region.","SCL’s main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience’s values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of “persuadables,” and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL’s defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company’s techniques is that it “can be undertaken covertly.”","“Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government’s role and/or third parties can be invisible,” he wrote.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Furthermore, she openly claims that Facebook gave the Obama campaigners a pass because of their political affiliation.","“Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing,” Davidsen wrote on Twitter.","“They came to office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side,” she continued.","Davidsen even showed an example of how the data sets were utilized.","The social media company’s attitude towards the Trump campaign’s use ​​of Facebook data, however, couldn’t be more different.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe,” Facebook stated in a Friday blog post. “He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.”","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” the statement continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.

When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama's campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn't heard of Wylie — or they barely remembered him.","Sean Kilpatrick/CANADIAN PRESS\nChristopher Wylie reported worked for the Liberal Party of Canada while Stephane Dion was leader.","\"I vaguely recall him,\" wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. \"I think that he was a summer intern.\"","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was \"pretty junior\" and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn't know Wylie well, they remembered him as a \"big advocate of microtargetting.\"","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama's campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","Cambridge Analytica worked on Brexit campaign","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2IBKHco?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.03643401434a","title":"U.S. and European officials question Facebook’s protection of personal data - The Washington Post","text":["U.S. and European officials on Sunday called for Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how personal information about tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm that worked for President Trump’s 2016 campaign — without the permission or knowledge of the vast majority of those affected.","News reports about Facebook’s role in the aggressive form of data collection also have raised serious questions about whether the company violated a landmark consent decree with a federal watchdog agency designed to prevent privacy violations. Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Fearing for his life and fighting to prove his own innocence, Max goes on the run with no one to trust and too many unanswered questions.","Max must dust off his own hacking skills and maneuver the dangerous labyrinth of underground hacktivist networks, ever-shifting alliances, and virtual identities — all while hoping to find the truth behind the “Silence of Six” before it’s too late....more","This book is so fucking good.I highly recommend this. I wish more people would read it honestly. It's very unfortunate that some good books, like this one, don't get the exposure they deserve.","Anyways... Here's a short gist for this book.","THE GIST","Death of a friend.Hackers.Frame-up.Conspiracy.Quest for the truth.","THE CHARACTERS","Max:I really liked Max. At first, he seemed like he was a douche. I'm not going to tell you why, because it would probably be a sort of spoiler. So no. I'm not going to say. But the good thing about him was that he totally redeemed himself as the story progresses. He was a strong and admirable character. Although, I would say that he what he did with the entire thing is a bit unrealistic. He's just a high school kid being hunted down by the FBI and those other bad guys. He could only do so much, right? I mean I believe the hacker things. I believe that a high school kid could possibly hack a high security website, but to keep himself out of danger when the people who he is up against has lots of controls to anything he has access on? It would have been slighly more believable if he was a secret agent or something and not a high school kid. Hehe.","Penny: I really liked how her character was revealed. Like Max, this girl is super smart and does so good at what she does. Which is hacking. Yes. A girl hacker. She was so cool. She isn't the typical damsel in distress. And the thing I liked most about her was how relateable she is. For me at least. She was an older sister who would do anything to protect her sister, even if it meant turning away from something important.","Evan: You never get to meet this guy but you feel that you already know him. How he responds to things and how obesessive he could sometimes get with all his hacking stuff. He is very passionate in what he was doing. At first, what he did seemed a bit shady, but I learned to love the guy, most especially towards the end. It was such a surprise.","The EVIL guy: I was totally caught off guard with this. Like a lot of things in this book, the bad guy was not who I expected it to be. So that is pretty cool!","ROMANCE","No insta-love!!! THANK FUCKING GOD!","I liked how the relationship between Penny and Max was not the insta-love/insta-attraction type. You see the chemistry between them. You see how they both fit together. And the even better thing about it was, it didn't take anything from the story. The author knows what to focus on. And he focus on the right one. He focused more on the plot line that was initially introduced in the story, not the budding love story subplot.","THE PACE","It was amazing. It would keep you at the edge of your seat the entire time. There is never a dull moment in this book. Everything was fast and informative. It was like all the scenes in this book was necessary to figure out what Evan meant by \"Silence of Six\". This book was like a Mission Impossible movie in book format. Although, this isn't really comparable to the action that MI has, but you get what I mean right? How everything is much faster in the movies? :D","THE WRITING","I loved the writing.","Let me just start to say that the author did not think, his readers were stupid. He gives us enough information for us to understand what was going on without over-exposing us to tons of information that we don't really need at all. He lets his reader do the imagining. He lets us use our brains. No information overload.","*cough*READY PLAYER ONE*cough*","This is a book about hackers getting entangled with something they shouldn't be. The author used some terminologies to give us a feel of how (possibly) hackers communicate and think. He didn't just through random hacker code everywhere just for the fun of it or to impress the readers about how much he knows about hacker language or works. There was none of that. And I appreciate that a lot.","FINAL WORDS","I highly recommend this for those of you guys who are so fed up of YA dystopian and want to try a fast paced thriller about a younger hacker who is trying to figure out the conspiracy that his dead friend discovered.","Please YA authors!!! Write more original and heart pumping books!!!! I beg you. I love YA, but I am getting really slumpy with the ones that I have been reading because of the typical format that most YA books have now. I think I mentioned this one on of my older reviews too, but yeah you guys get what I mean right?","The Silence of Six is a highly recommended book for me. I would like to say that it's one of the best books I've read so far this year. And I really hope books like these would be more known than some over-hyped books that are honestly, not really that good. I'm not saying that some over-hyped books are bad, but most of them are just really over-hyped.","Anyways, yes, read this! Read this really!!!","If you guys have read this, or haven't read it...

It lets the audience come to their own conclusions, which I find is always a more powerful way of eliciting change.","A book with teenage protagonists is all fun and snark, sure, but there's a deeper layer that gets you thinking about critical issues without throwing them in your face.","Now, this didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book, and perhaps it's my while, male, Canadian privilege speaking, but I just don't have the same fear of the government or of privacy intrusion.

It was admittedly entertaining, but there was something missing from the novel, some sort of soul behind it that would make some sort of lingering impact on the reader. The characters never came alive for me, the climax of the novel was somewhat anti-climactic and resolved a bit too easily, and I felt like the story, particularly the conspiracy behind it all, was too convoluted and overreaching for its own good.

During the conference Max uncovers it is actually his best friend Evan in the video, whom he has neglected the last year in an effort to distance himself from the hacker underworld and its activities they both where dabbling in.

Max is a quick thinker and has awesome hacking skills but he also has flaws and insecurities he can admit to making him very easy to identify with.

Did I seem particularly masculine online?\" \"No, but... you didn't seem particularly feminine,\" Max said. \"What does that even mean?\" He massaged the corners of his eyes. \"I don't know. Forget it.\" \"You didn't seem particularly sexist online, but here we are.\"","The effort put into the writing and the trust developing between the two main characters can easily be spotted.

Myers ever since I heard about his Fair Coin novel when it was initially released. However, The Silence of the Six is actually the first time I’ve got the chance to read something by the author, and as it turned out, it didn’t disappoint, delivering a fantastic young adult novel that makes for a refreshing break from all the no-hope, dark, frequent love-triangle featuring dystopian dramas that young adult has been filled with ever since The Hunger Games was released. It’s similar to that of Kim Curran’s awesome Glaze, another young adult novel which I can highly recommend, and has several things going for it, and on top of the similarities with Glaze, I also couldn’t help be reminded of the awesome Person of Interest whilst I was reading the book, even if obviously they are too very different things. So it’s always a good sign when the novel not only can be comparable with one of my favourite young adult reads of this year, but also my favourite TV Series that’s currently on air.","The Silence of the Six explores a fascinating complex. Max Stein, a seventeen year old former hacker turned one of the most popular kids in school, complete a girlfriend named Courtney, finds his life turned upside down when his best friend Evan kills himself just moments after hacking into the live-streaming Presidential debate at their local high school. It isn’t long before he finds himself the target of the corporate-government, and with things looking increasingly desperate, he’s found himself constantly pushed into a corner with allies decreasing at every passing second.","The characters themselves are great, well developed and constantly grow over the course of the novel. Max gets the most notable development as the main character, but also there’s a good role for Courtney among other characters. It handles the situation realistically and really is a good book for making you think about what goes on behind the scenes, with the novel exploring the world of hackers which is something that works both in the novel’s favour and against it.","For example, someone who isn’t that big on advanced computer technology it can be a lot to stomach the details. Despite this though, the book should provide a very entertaining read, with plenty of stuff going on from start to finish. It might not quite be everyone’s cup of tea, but it was something that I really ended up loving. It got better and better as things progressed and by the end of the novel I was struggling to put it down.","The Silence of the Six is a pretty brilliant read and if you like good, mystery/thriller young adult novels set in a modern day setting then you’ll certainly get a kick out of E.C. Myer’s latest. Even if you’re not necessarily an avid reader of young adult, if stuff like Person of Interest (like I’ve already mentioned) and Watch Dogs is your sort of thing then The Silence of the Six should be right up your street. Recommended.","The Silence of Six opens with a literal bang: Max Stein's best friend, Evan Baxter, hacks into a presidential debate feed and blows his head off after delivering an ominous message: \"What is the silence of six, and what are you going to do about it?\"","It's a great hook (though it made me uncomfortable that Evan had Asperger's and then died in the first chapter, not that his presence isn't felt throughout the entire book), and it's not long before Max falls back into the hacker life he'd recently gThe Silence of Six opens with a literal bang: Max Stein's best friend, Evan Baxter, hacks into a presidential debate feed and blows his head off after delivering an ominous message: \"What is the silence of six, and what are you going to do about it?\"","It's a great hook (though it made me uncomfortable that Evan had Asperger's and then died in the first chapter, not that his presence isn't felt throughout the entire book), and it's not long before Max falls back into the hacker life he'd recently given up and flees from the Feds. A hacker on the run from the government after a tragedy? Shades of Little Brother, for sure, but this book is more of a conspiracy thriller, keeping things moving much more swiftly.","The world of The Silence of Six mirrors our own: millions of people connect on Panjea, a Twitter-like social media platform. Net neutrality is a key issue in the election, along with Internet surveillance. An Anonymous-like hacktivist group called Dramatis Personai targets sites like Panjea for its privacy issues. Very little in the book seems far-fetched because it's about all the things we talk about on Twitter. If the hot buzzwords aren't enough, it's full of fun codes and password hints and puzzles Max has to crack as he tries to solve the mystery Evan has left for him, and they frequently involve geeky references. (I, of course, have no idea how accurate any of the hacking stuff is, but it seemed more realistic than it is in movies. No one has the reflection of green text glowing on their face.)","The book really picks up a little over a third of the way in, once Max finally gains some allies in his fight against...whoever the enemy is. What is the silence of six? Max finds out, and it's not pretty. His journey takes him far from home and right into the belly of the beast. As he and his allies discover more and more about the conspiracy, I found myself saying, \"Holy shit!\" right along with him.","While I did like Max's characterization as it related to his guilt over Evan's death, I kept being distracted by soccer metaphors. At first, it seemed clever, in that the fact that Max played soccer shaped how he viewed the world, but because we never actually see Max play soccer, it began to ring more and more false, an attempt to give him another dimension and perhaps focus his struggle for a non-hacker identity. We get a small baseline of what Max's life is like in the beginning, but it's clear Max is a hacker at heart, not a soccer player at heart. And while I did like Max, I really liked his hacker allies, whom I can't talk about because the reveal is too fun. Suffice it to say that their introduction is when I said out loud, \"I am so in.\"","The Silence of Six gets more exciting as it builds, Max and Co. doing illegal things, investigating illegal things, speaking jargon (but always explaining what they're doing), and...saving the day? Maybe? If you're looking for a topical hacker conspiracy thriller, look no further!...more","Oh boy, how much I loved this book.

But I do like to read stories articles about hackers and the Deep Web (quite disturbing, I'm not going to lie), so when I saw this book, I could not resist. It was literally calling out to me, begging me to buy it.","What I was afraid of, was the suicide of the protagonist's best friend. Not even the death itself as much as the effect it could have had on Max. I've read too many 'close-person-dying' books not to be paranoid. In situations like this, the main character mostly decides that the death of the given person was entirely their fault and whines about it half of the book. Max didn't, thank god. He wasn't oblivious to the fact the he may have helped his friend if he had been around more, but he didn't just sit around blaming himself. He took the matters into his own hands and did everything he could to make Evan's sacrifice worth it. That's what I probably like the most, the devotion and all","I'm often told that I'm an awful cynic and that I lack any sense of appreciation for romance, which is very true, I suppose. Therefore, I didn't mind the very predictable romance this book offers (if you can even call it that) in the least. This isn't supposed to focus on the romance, after all. If it was, I'd probably burn it in the fires of hell.","So... What is the silence of six and what are you going to do about it?

With a question about \"the silence of six\" and a reactionary government in place, a former hacker teen is dragged back into the culture to try and solve the issue as to why his friend offed himself and what the government is hiding.","There's going to be unavoidable comparisons to Doctorow's Little Brother, and they're fairly well deserved on a whole, as they are, at its basis, about the era of privacy in a world where it's disappearing fast. Where Doctorow's books invariably devolve into advocacy, however, Myers keeps it simple by presenting the sorts of apps and programs and activities a privacy-minded person would use as simple plot points rather than paranoia. It works well as it allows the story to remain just that even when more savvy readers might know where things are headed.","The downside? The pace is almost too breakneck for its own good at times, meaning the slower points feel really draggy in comparison. There's the occasional issue of the government agents both being far too competent and bumbling all at once, and I can't say the ending felt all that realistic, but in what is a book that celebrates paranoia a bit, it works in the setting.","Overall, if you're looking for lighter fare that hits upon a lot of notes we don't see too often in YA or otherwise, this one is worth a look.

We hope you understand, and consider subscribing for unlimited online access.","How Obama’s Team Used Big Data to Rally Voters","How President Obama’s campaign used big data to rally individual voters.","The Obama 2012 campaign used data analytics and the experimental method to assemble a winning coalition vote by vote. In doing so, it overturned the long dominance of TV advertising in U.S. politics and created something new in the world: a national campaign run like a local ward election, where the interests of individual voters were known and addressed.","Two years after Barack Obama’s election as president, Democrats suffered their worst defeat in decades. The congressional majorities that had given Obama his legislative successes, reforming the health-insurance and financial markets, were swept away in the midterm elections; control of the House flipped and the Democrats’ lead in the Senate shrank to an ungovernably slim margin. Pundits struggled to explain the rise of the Tea Party. Voters’ disappointment with the Obama agenda was evident as independents broke right and Democrats stayed home. In 2010, the Democratic National Committee failed its first test of the Obama era: it had not kept the Obama coalition together.","But for Democrats, there was bleak consolation in all this: Dan Wagner had seen it coming. When Wagner was hired as the DNC’s targeting director, in January of 2009, he became responsible for collecting voter information and analyzing it to help the committee approach individual voters by direct mail and phone. But he appreciated that the raw material he was feeding into his statistical models amounted to a series of surveys on voters’ attitudes and preferences. He asked the DNC’s technology department to develop software that could turn that information into tables, and he called the result Survey Manager.","That fall, when a special election was held to fill an open congressional seat in upstate New York, Wagner successfully predicted the final margin within 150 votes—well before Election Day. Months later, pollsters projected that Martha Coakley was certain to win another special election, to fill the Massachusetts Senate seat left empty by the death of Ted Kennedy. But Wagner’s Survey Manager correctly predicted that the Republican Scott Brown was likely to prevail in the strongly Democratic state. “It’s one thing to be right when you’re going to win,” says Jeremy Bird, who served as national deputy director of Organizing for America, the Obama campaign in abeyance, housed at the DNC. “It’s another thing to be right when you’re going to lose.”","It is yet another thing to be right five months before you’re going to lose. As the 2010 midterms approached, Wagner built statistical models for selected Senate races and 74 congressional districts. Starting in June, he began predicting the elections’ outcomes, forecasting the margins of victory with what turned out to be improbable accuracy. But he hadn’t gotten there with traditional polls. He had counted votes one by one. His first clue that the party was in trouble came from thousands of individual survey calls matched to rich statistical profiles in the DNC’s databases. Core Democratic voters were telling the DNC’s callers that they were much less likely to vote than statistical probability suggested. Wagner could also calculate how much the Democrats’ mobilization programs would do to increase turnout among supporters, and in most races he knew it wouldn’t be enough to cover the gap revealing itself in Survey Manager’s tables.","His congressional predictions were off by an average of only 2.5 percent. “That was a proof point for a lot of people who don’t understand the math behind it but understand the value of what that math produces,” says Mitch Stewart, Organizing for America’s director. “Once that first special [election] happened, his word was the gold standard at the DNC.”","The significance of Wagner’s achievement went far beyond his ability to declare winners months before Election Day. His approach amounted to a decisive break with 20th-century tools for tracking public opinion, which revolved around quarantining small samples that could be treated as representative of the whole. Wagner had emerged from a cadre of analysts who thought of voters as individuals and worked to aggregate projections about their opinions and behavior until they revealed a composite picture of everyone. His techniques marked the fulfillment of a new way of thinking, a decade in the making, in which voters were no longer trapped in old political geographies or tethered to traditional demographic categories, such as age or gender, depending on which attributes pollsters asked about or how consumer marketers classified them for commercial purposes. Instead, the electorate could be seen as a collection of individual citizens who could each be measured and assessed on their own terms. Now it was up to a candidate who wanted to lead those people to build a campaign that would interact with them the same way.","Dan Wagner, the chief analytics officer for Obama 2012, led the campaign’s “Cave” of data scientists.","After the voters returned Obama to office for a second term, his campaign became celebrated for its use of technology—much of it developed by an unusual team of coders and engineers—that redefined how individuals could use the Web, social media, and smartphones to participate in the political process. A mobile app allowed a canvasser to download and return walk sheets without ever entering a campaign office; a Web platform called Dashboard gamified volunteer activity by ranking the most active supporters; and “targeted sharing” protocols mined an Obama backer’s Facebook network in search of friends the campaign wanted to register, mobilize, or persuade.","But underneath all that were scores describing particular voters: a new political currency that predicted the behavior of individual humans. The campaign didn’t just know who you were; it knew exactly how it could turn you into the type of person it wanted you to be.","The Scores","Four years earlier, Dan Wagner had been working at a Chicago economic consultancy, using forecasting skills developed studying econometrics at the University of Chicago, when he fell for Barack Obama and decided he wanted to work on his home-state senator’s 2008 presidential campaign. Wagner, then 24, was soon in Des Moines, handling data entry for the state voter file that guided Obama to his crucial victory in the Iowa caucuses. He bounced from state to state through the long primary calendar, growing familiar with voter data and the ways of using statistical models to intelligently sort the electorate. For the general election, he was named lead targeter for the Great Lakes/Ohio River Valley region, the most intense battleground in the country.","After Obama’s victory, many of his top advisors decamped to Washington to make preparations for governing. Wagner was told to stay behind and serve on a post-election task force that would review a campaign that had looked, to the outside world, technically flawless.","In the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s targeters had assigned every voter in the country a pair of scores based on the probability that the individual would perform two distinct actions that mattered to the campaign: casting a ballot and supporting Obama. These scores were derived from an unprecedented volume of ongoing survey work. For each battleground state every week, the campaign’s call centers conducted 5,000 to 10,000 so-called short-form interviews that quickly gauged a voter’s preferences, and 1,000 interviews in a long-form version that was more like a traditional poll. To derive individual-level predictions, algorithms trawled for patterns between these opinions and the data points the campaign had assembled for every voter—as many as one thousand variables each, drawn from voter registration records, consumer data warehouses, and past campaign contacts.","This innovation was most valued in the field. There, an almost perfect cycle of microtargeting models directed volunteers to scripted conversations with specific voters at the door or over the phone. Each of those interactions produced data that streamed back into Obama’s servers to refine the models pointing volunteers toward the next door worth a knock. The efficiency and scale of that process put the Democrats well ahead when it came to profiling voters. John McCain’s campaign had, in most states, run its statistical model just once, assigning each voter to one of its microtargeting segments in the summer. McCain’s advisors were unable to recalculate the probability that those voters would support their candidate as the dynamics of the race changed. Obama’s scores, on the other hand, adjusted weekly, responding to new events like Sarah Palin’s vice-presidential nomination or the collapse of Lehman Brothers.","Within the campaign, however, the Obama data operations were understood to have shortcomings. As was typical in political information infrastructure, knowledge about people was stored separately from data about the campaign’s interactions with them, mostly because the databases built for those purposes had been developed by different consultants who had no interest in making their systems work together.","But the task force knew the next campaign wasn’t stuck with that situation. Obama would run his final race not as an insurgent against a party establishment, but as the establishment itself. For four years, the task force members knew, their team would control the Democratic Party’s apparatus. Their demands, not the offerings of consultants and vendors, would shape the marketplace. Their report recommended developing a “constituent relationship management system” that would allow staff across the campaign to look up individuals not just as voters or volunteers or donors or website users but as citizens in full. “We realized there was a problem with how our data and infrastructure interacted with the rest of the campaign, and we ought to be able to offer it to all parts of the campaign,” says Chris Wegrzyn, a database applications developer who served on the task force.","Wegrzyn became the DNC’s lead targeting developer and oversaw a series of costly acquisitions, all intended to free the party from the traditional dependence on outside vendors. The committee installed a Siemens Enterprise System phone-dialing unit that could put out 1.2 million calls a day to survey voters’ opinions. Later, party leaders signed off on a $280,000 license to use Vertica software from Hewlett-Packard that allowed their servers to access not only the party’s 180-million-person voter file but all the data about volunteers, donors, and those who had interacted with Obama online.","Many of those who went to Washington after the 2008 election in order to further the president’s political agenda returned to Chicago in the spring of 2011 to work on his reëlection. The chastening losses they had experienced in Washington separated them from those who had known only the ecstasies of 2008. “People who did ‘08, but didn’t do ‘10, and came back in ‘11 or ‘12—they had the hardest culture clash,” says Jeremy Bird, who became national field director on the reëlection campaign. But those who went to Washington and returned to Chicago developed a particular appreciation for Wagner’s methods of working with the electorate at an atomic level. It was a way of thinking that perfectly aligned with their ­simple theory of what it would take to win the president reëlection: get everyone who had voted for him in 2008 to do it again. At the same time, they knew they would need to succeed at registering and mobilizing new voters, especially in some of the fastest-growing demographic categories, to make up for any 2008 voters who did defect.","Obama’s campaign began the election year confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House. They may have cast those votes by secret ballot, but Obama’s analysts could look at the Democrats’ vote totals in each precinct and identify the people most likely to have backed him. Pundits talked in the abstract about reassembling Obama’s 2008 coalition. But within the campaign, the goal was literal. They would reassemble the coalition, one by one, through personal contacts.","The Experiments","When Jim Messina arrived in Chicago as Obama’s newly minted campaign manager in January of 2011, he imposed a mandate on his recruits: they were to make decisions based on measurable data. But that didn’t mean quite what it had four years before. The 2008 campaign had been “data-driven,” as people liked to say. This reflected a principled imperative to challenge the political establishment with an empirical approach to electioneering, and it was greatly influenced by David Plouffe, the 2008 campaign manager, who loved metrics, spreadsheets, and performance reports. Plouffe wanted to know: How many of a field office’s volunteer shifts had been filled last weekend? How much money did that ad campaign bring in?","But for all its reliance on data, the 2008 Obama campaign had remained insulated from the most important methodological innovation in 21st-century politics. In 1998, Yale professors Don Green and Alan Gerber conducted the first randomized controlled trial in modern political science, assigning New Haven voters to receive nonpartisan election reminders by mail, phone, or in-person visit from a canvasser and measuring which group saw the greatest increase in turnout. The subsequent wave of field experiments by Green, Gerber, and their followers focused on mobilization, testing competing modes of contact and get-out-the-vote language to see which were most successful.","The first Obama campaign used the findings of such tests to tweak call scripts and canvassing protocols, but it never fully embraced the experimental revolution itself. After Dan Wagner moved to the DNC, the party decided it would start conducting its own experiments. He hoped the committee could become “a driver of research for the Democratic Party.”","To that end, he hired the Analyst Institute, a Washington-based consortium founded under the AFL-CIO’s leadership in 2006 to coördinate field research projects across the electioneering left and distribute the findings among allies. Much of the experimental world’s research had focused on voter registration, because that was easy to measure. The breakthrough was that registration no longer had to be approached passively; organizers did not have to simply wait for the unenrolled to emerge from anonymity, sign a form, and, they hoped, vote. New techniques made it possible to intelligently profile nonvoters: commercial data warehouses sold lists of all voting-age adults, and comparing those lists with registration rolls revealed eligible candidates, each attached to a home address to which an application could be mailed. Applying microtargeting models identified which nonregistrants were most likely to be Democrats and which ones Republicans.","The Obama campaign embedded social scientists from the Analyst Institute among its staff. Party officials knew that adding new Democratic voters to the registration rolls was a crucial element in their strategy for 2012. But already the campaign had ambitions beyond merely modifying nonparticipating citizens’ behavior through registration and mobilization. It wanted to take on the most vexing problem in politics: changing voters’ minds.","The expansion of individual-level data had made possible the kind of testing that could help do that. Experimenters had typically calculated the average effect of their interventions across the entire population. But as campaigns developed deep portraits of the voters in their databases, it became possible to measure the attributes of the people who were actually moved by an experiment’s impact. A series of tests in 2006 by the women’s group Emily’s List had illustrated the potential of conducting controlled trials with microtargeting databases. When the group sent direct mail in favor of Democratic gubernatorial candidates, it barely budged those whose scores placed them in the middle of the partisan spectrum; it had a far greater impact upon those who had been profiled as soft (or nonideological) Republicans.","That test, and others that followed, demonstrated the limitations of traditional targeting. Such techniques rested on a series of long-standing assumptions—for instance, that middle-of-the-roaders were the most persuadable and that infrequent voters were the likeliest to be captured in a get-out-the-vote drive. But the experiments introduced new uncertainty. People who were identified as having a 50 percent likelihood of voting for a Democrat might in fact be torn between the two parties, or they might look like centrists only because no data attached to their records pushed a partisan prediction in one direction or another. “The scores in the middle are the people we know less about,” says Chris Wyant, a 2008 field organizer who became the campaign’s general election director in Ohio four years later. “The extent to which we were guessing about persuasion was not lost on any of us.”","One way the campaign sought to identify the ripest targets was through a series of what the Analyst Institute called “experiment-informed programs,” or EIPs, designed to measure how effective different types of messages were at moving public opinion.","The traditional way of doing this had been to audition themes and language in focus groups and then test the winning material in polls to see which categories of voters responded positively to each approach. Any insights were distorted by the artificial settings and by the tiny samples of demographic subgroups in traditional polls. “You’re making significant resource decisions based on 160 people?” asks Mitch Stewart, director of the Democratic campaign group Organizing for America. “Isn’t that nuts? And people have been doing that for decades!”","An experimental program would use those steps to develop a range of prospective messages that could be subjected to empirical testing in the real world. Experimenters would randomly assign voters to receive varied sequences of direct mail—four pieces on the same policy theme, each making a slightly different case for Obama—and then use ongoing survey calls to isolate the attributes of those whose opinions changed as a result.","In March, the campaign used this technique to test various ways of promoting the administration’s health-care policies. One series of mailers described Obama’s regulatory reforms; another advised voters that they were now entitled to free regular check-ups and ought to schedule one. The experiment revealed how much voter response differed by age, especially among women. Older women thought more highly of the policies when they received reminders about preventive care; younger women liked them more when they were told about contraceptive coverage and new rules that prohibited insurance companies from charging women more.","When Paul Ryan was named to the Republican ticket in August, Obama’s advisors rushed out an EIP that compared different lines of attack about Medicare. The results were surprising. “The electorate [had seemed] very inelastic,” says Terry Walsh, who coördinated the campaign’s polling and paid-media spending. “In fact, when we did the Medicare EIPs, we got positive movement that was very heartening, because it was at a time when we were not seeing a lot of movement in the electorate.” But that movement came from quarters where a traditional campaign would never have gone hunting for minds it could change. The Obama team found that voters between 45 and 65 were more likely to change their views about the candidates after hearing Obama’s Medicare arguments than those over 65, who were currently eligible for the program.","A similar strategy of targeting an unexpected population emerged from a July EIP testing Obama’s messages aimed at women. The voters most responsive to the campaign’s arguments about equal-pay measures and women’s health, it found, were those whose likelihood of supporting the president was scored at merely 20 and 40 percent. Those scores suggested that they probably shared Republican attitudes; but here was one thing that could pull them to Obama. As a result, when Obama unveiled a direct-mail track addressing only women’s issues, it wasn’t to shore up interest among core parts of the Democratic coalition, but to reach over for conservatives who were at odds with their party on gender concerns. “The whole goal of the women’s track was to pick off votes for Romney,” says Walsh. “We were able to persuade people who fell low on candidate support scores if we gave them a specific message.”","At the same time, Obama’s campaign was pursuing a second, even more audacious adventure in persuasion: one-on-one interaction. Traditionally, campaigns have restricted their persuasion efforts to channels like mass media or direct mail, where they can control presentation, language, and targeting. Sending volunteers to persuade voters would mean forcing them to interact with opponents, or with voters who were undecided because they were alienated from politics on delicate issues like abortion. Campaigns have typically resisted relinquishing control of ground-level interactions with voters to risk such potentially combustible situations; they felt they didn’t know enough about their supporters or volunteers. “You can have a negative impact,” says Jeremy Bird, who served as national deputy director of Organizing for America. “You can hurt your candidate.”","In February, however, Obama volunteers attempted 500,000 conversations with the goal of winning new supporters. Voters who’d been randomly selected from a group identified as persuadable were polled after a phone conversation that began with a volunteer reading from a script. “We definitely find certain people moved more than other people,” says Bird. Analysts identified their attributes and made them the core of a persuasion model that predicted, on a scale of 0 to 10, the likelihood that a voter could be pulled in Obama’s direction after a single volunteer interaction. The experiment also taught Obama’s field department about its volunteers. Those in California, which had always had an exceptionally mature volunteer organization for a non-­battleground state, turned out to be especially persuasive: voters called by Californians, no matter what state they were in themselves, were more likely to become Obama supporters.","Alex Lundry created Mitt Romney’s data science unit. It was less than one-tenth the size of Obama’s analytics team.","With these findings in hand, Obama’s strategists grew confident that they were no longer restricted to advertising as a channel for persuasion. They began sending trained volunteers to knock on doors or make phone calls with the objective of changing minds.","That dramatic shift in the culture of electioneering was felt on the streets, but it was possible only because of advances in analytics. Chris Wegrzyn, a database applications developer, developed a program code-named Airwolf that matched county and state lists of people who had requested mail ballots with the campaign’s list of e-mail addresses. Likely Obama supporters would get regular reminders from their local field organizers, asking them to return their ballots, and, once they had, a message thanking them and proposing other ways to be involved in the campaign. The local organizer would receive daily lists of the voters on his or her turf who had outstanding ballots so that the campaign could follow up with personal contact by phone or at the doorstep. “It is a fundamental way of tying together the online and offline worlds,” says Wagner.","Wagner, however, was turning his attention beyond the field. By June of 2011, he was chief analytics officer for the campaign and had begun making the rounds of the other units at headquarters, from fund-raising to communications, offering to help “solve their problems with data.” He imagined the analytics department—now a 54-person staff, housed in a windowless office known as the Cave—as an “in-house consultancy” with other parts of the campaign as its clients. “There’s a process of helping people learn about the tools so they can be a participant in the process,” he says. “We essentially built products for each of those various departments that were paired up with a massive database we had.”","The Flow","As job notices seeking specialists in text analytics, computational advertising, and online experiments came out of the incumbent’s campaign, Mitt Romney’s advisors at the Republicans’ headquarters in Boston’s North End watched with a combination of awe and perplexity. Throughout the primaries, Romney had appeared to be the only Republican running a 21st-century campaign, methodically banking early votes in states like Florida and Ohio before his disorganized opponents could establish operations there.","But the Republican winner’s relative sophistication in the primaries belied a poverty of expertise compared with the Obama campaign. Since his first campaign for governor of Massachusetts, in 2002, Romney had relied upon ­TargetPoint Consulting, a Virginia firm that was then a pioneer in linking information from consumer data warehouses to voter registration records and using it to develop individual-level predictive models. It was TargetPoint’s CEO, Alexander Gage, who had coined the term “microtargeting” to describe the process, which he modeled on the corporate world’s approach to customer relationship management.","Such techniques had offered George W. Bush’s reëlection campaign a significant edge in targeting, but Republicans had done little to institutionalize that advantage in the years since. By 2006, Democrats had not only matched Republicans in adopting commercial marketing techniques; they had moved ahead by integrating methods developed in the social sciences.","Romney’s advisors knew that Obama was building innovative internal data analytics departments, but they didn’t feel a need to match those activities. “I don’t think we thought, relative to the marketplace, we could be the best at data in-house all the time,” Romney’s digital director, Zac Moffatt, said in July. “Our idea is to find the best firms to work with us.” As a result, Romney remained dependent on TargetPoint to develop voter segments, often just once, and then deliver them to the campaign’s databases. That was the structure Obama had abandoned after winning the nomination in 2008.","In May a TargetPoint vice president, Alex Lundry, took leave from his post at the firm to assemble a data science unit within Romney’s headquarters. To round out his team, Lundry brought in Tom Wood, a University of Chicago postdoctoral student in political science, and Brent McGoldrick, a veteran of Bush’s 2004 campaign who had left politics for the consulting firm Financial Dynamics (later FTI Consulting), where he helped financial-services, health-care, and energy companies communicate better. But Romney’s data science team was less than one-tenth the size of Obama’s analytics department. Without a large in-house staff to handle the massive national data sets that made it possible to test and track citizens, Romney’s data scientists never tried to deepen their understanding of individual behavior. Instead, they fixated on trying to unlock one big, persistent mystery, which Lundry framed this way: “How can we get a sense of whether this advertising is working?”","“You usually get GRPs and tracking polls,” he says, referring to the gross ratings points that are the basic unit of measuring television buys. “There’s a very large causal leap you have to make from one to the other.”","Lundry decided to focus on more manageable ways of measuring what he called the information flow. His team converted topics of political communication into discrete units they called “entities.” They initially classified 200 of them, including issues like the auto industry bailout, controversies like the one surrounding federal funding for the solar-power company Solyndra, and catchphrases like “the war on women.” When a new concept (such as Obama’s offhand remark, during a speech about our common dependence on infrastructure, that “you didn’t build that”) emerged as part of the election-year lexicon, the analysts added it to the list. They tracked each entity on the National Dialogue Monitor, TargetPoint’s system for measuring the frequency and tone with which certain topics are mentioned across all media. TargetPoint also integrated content collected from newspaper websites and closed-caption transcripts of broadcast programs. Lundry’s team aimed to examine how every entity fared over time in each of two categories: the informal sphere of social media, especially Twitter, and the journalistic product that campaigns call earned press coverage.","Ultimately, Lundry wanted to assess the impact that each type of public attention had on what mattered most to them: Romney’s position in the horse race. He turned to vector autoregression models, which equities traders use to isolate the influence of single variables on market movements. In this case, Lundry’s team looked for patterns in the relationship between the National Dialogue Monitor’s data and Romney’s numbers in Gallup’s daily tracking polls. By the end of July, they thought they had identified a three-step process they called “Wood’s Triangle.”","Within three or four days of a new entity’s entry into the conversation, either through paid ads or through the news cycle, it was possible to make a well-informed hypothesis about whether the topic was likely to win media attention by tracking whether it generated Twitter chatter. That informal conversation among political-class elites typically led to traditional print or broadcast press coverage one to two days later, and that, in turn, might have an impact on the horse race. “We saw this process over and over again,” says Lundry.","They began to think of ads as a “shock to the system”—a way to either introduce a new topic or restore focus on an area in which elite interest had faded. If an entity didn’t gain its own energy—as when the Republicans charged over the summer that the White House had waived the work requirements in the federal welfare rules—Lundry would propose a “re-shock to the system” with another ad on the subject five to seven days later. After 12 to 14 days, Lundry found, an entity had passed through the system and exhausted its ability to alter public opinion—so he would recommend to the campaign’s communications staff that they move on to something new.","Those insights offered campaign officials a theory of information flows, but they provided no guidance in how to allocate campaign resources in order to win the Electoral College. Assuming that Obama had superior ground-level data and analytics, Romney’s campaign tried to leverage its rivals’ strategy to shape its own; if Democrats thought a state or media market was competitive, maybe that was evidence that Republicans should think so too. “We were necessarily reactive, because we were putting together the plane as it took off,” Lundry says. “They had an enormous head start on us.”","Romney’s political department began holding regular meetings to look at where in the country the Obama campaign was focusing resources like ad dollars and the president’s time. The goal was to try to divine the calculations behind those decisions. It was, in essence, the way Microsoft’s Bing approached Google: trying to reverse-engineer the market leader’s code by studying the visible output. “We watch where the president goes,” Dan ­Centinello, the Romney deputy political director who oversaw the meetings, said over the summer.","Obama’s media-buying strategy proved particularly hard to decipher. In early September, as part of his standard review, Lundry noticed that the week after the Democratic convention, Obama had aired 68 ads in Dothan, Alabama, a town near the Florida border. Dothan was one of the country’s smallest media markets, and Alabama one of the safest Republican states. Even though the area was known to savvy ad buyers as one of the places where a media market crosses state lines, Dothan TV stations reached only about 9,000 Florida voters, and around 7,000 of them had voted for John McCain in 2008. “This is a hard-core Republican media market,” Lundry says. “It’s incredibly tiny. But they were advertising there.”","Romney’s advisors might have formed a theory about the broader media environment, but whatever was sending Obama hunting for a small pocket of votes was beyond their measurement. “We could tell,” says McGoldrick, “that there was something in the algorithms that was telling them what to run.”","The March","In the summer of 2011, Carol Davidsen received a message from Dan Wagner. Already the Obama campaign was known for its relentless e-mails beseeching supporters to give their money or time, but this one offered something that intrigued Davidsen: a job. Wagner had sorted the campaign’s list of donors, stretching back to 2008, to find those who described their occupation with terms like “data” and “analytics” and sent them all invitations to apply for work in his new analytics department.","Davidsen was working at Navic Networks, a Microsoft-owned company that wrote code for set-top cable boxes to create a record of a user’s DVR or tuner history, when she heeded Wagner’s call. One year before Election Day, she started work in the campaign’s technology department to serve as product manager for Narwhal. That was the code name, borrowed from a tusked whale, for an ambitious effort to match records from previously unconnected databases so that a user’s online interactions with the campaign could be synchronized. With Narwhal, e-mail blasts asking people to volunteer could take their past donation history into consideration, and the algorithms determining how much a supporter would be asked to contribute could be shaped by knowledge about his or her reaction to previous solicitations. This integration enriched a technique, common in website development, that Obama’s online fund-raising efforts had used to good effect in 2008: the A/B test, in which users are randomly directed to different versions of a thing and their responses are compared. Now analysts could leverage personal data to identify the attributes of those who responded, and use that knowledge to refine subsequent appeals. “You can cite people’s other types of engagement,” says ­Amelia ­Showalter, Obama’s director of digital analytics. “We discovered that there were a lot of things that built goodwill, like signing the president’s birthday card or getting a free bumper sticker, that led them to become more engaged with the campaign in other ways.”","If online communication had been the aspect of the 2008 campaign subjected to the most rigorous empirical examination—it’s easy to randomly assign e-mails in an A/B test and compare click-through rates or donation levels—mass-media strategy was among those that received the least. Television and radio ads had to be purchased by geographic zone, and the available data on who watches which channels or shows, collected by research firms like Nielsen and Scarborough, often included little more than viewer age and gender. That might be good enough to guide buys for Schick or Foot Locker, but it’s of limited value for advertisers looking to define audiences in political terms.","As campaign manager Jim Messina prepared to spend as much as half a billion dollars on mass media for Obama’s reëlection, he set out to reinvent the process for allocating resources across broadcast, cable, satellite, and online channels. “If you think about the universe of possible places for an advertiser, it’s almost infinite,” says Amy Gershkoff, who was hired as the campaign’s media-planning director on the strength of her successful negotiations, while at her firm Changing Targets in 2009, to link the information from cable systems to individual microtargeting profiles. “There are tens of millions of opportunities where a campaign can put its next dollar. You have all this great, robust voter data that doesn’t fit together with the media data. How you knit that together is a challenge.”","By the start of 2012, ­Wagner had deftly wrested command of media planning into his own department. As he expanded the scope of analytics, he defined his purview as “the study and practice of resource optimization for the purpose of improving programs and earning votes more efficiently.” That usually meant calculating, for any campaign activity, the number of votes gained through a given amount of contact at a given cost.","But when it came to buying media, such calculations had been simply impossible, because campaigns were unable to link what they knew about voters to what cable providers knew about their customers. Obama’s advisors decided that the data made available in the private sector had long led political advertisers to ask the wrong questions. Walsh says of the effort to reimagine the media-targeting process: “It was not to get a better understanding of what 35-plus women watch on TV. It was to find out how many of our persuadable voters were watching those dayparts.”","Davidsen, whose previous work had left her intimately familiar with the rich data sets held in set-top boxes, understood that a lot of that data was available in the form of tuner and DVR histories collected by cable providers and then aggregated by research firms. For privacy reasons, however, the information was not available at the individual level. “The hardest thing in media buying right now is the lack of information,” she says.","Davidsen began negotiating to have research firms repackage their data in a form that would permit the campaign to access the individual histories without violating the cable providers’ privacy standards. Under a $350,000 deal she worked out with one company, Rentrak, the campaign provided a list of persuadable voters and their addresses, derived from its microtargeting models, and the company looked for them in the cable providers’ billing files. When a record matched, ­Rentrak would issue it a unique household ID that identified viewing data from a single set-top box but masked any personally identifiable information.","The Obama campaign had created its own television ratings system, a kind of Nielsen in which the only viewers who mattered were those not yet fully committed to a presidential candidate. But Davidsen had to get the information into a practical form by early May, when Obama strategists planned to start running their anti-Romney ads. She oversaw the development of a software platform the Obama staff called the Optimizer, which broke the day into 96 quarter-hour segments and assessed which time slots across 60 channels offered the greatest number of persuadable targets per dollar. (By September, she had unlocked an even richer trove of data: a cable system in Toledo, Ohio, that tracked viewers’ tuner histories by the second.) “The revolution of media buying in this campaign,” says Walsh, “was to turn what was a broadcast medium into something that looks a lot more like a narrowcast medium.”","When the Obama campaign did use television as a mass medium, it was because the Optimizer had concluded it would be a more efficient way of reaching persuadable targets. Sometimes a national cable ad was a better bargain than a large number of local buys in the 66 media markets reaching battleground states. But the occasional national buy also had other benefits. It could boost fund-raising and motivate volunteers in states that weren’t essential to Obama’s Electoral College arithmetic. And, says Davidsen, “it helps hide some of the strategy of your buying.”","Even without that tactic, Obama’s buys perplexed the Romney analysts in Boston. They had invested in their own media-intelligence platform, called Centraforce. It used some of the same aggregated data sources that were feeding into the Optimizer, and at times both seemed to send the campaigns to the same unlikely ad blocks—for example, in reruns on TV Land. But there was a lot more to what Lundry called Obama’s “highly variable” media strategy. Many of the Democrats’ ads were placed in fringe markets, on marginal stations, and at odd times where few political candidates had ever seen value. Romney’s data scientists simply could not decode those decisions without the voter models or persuasion experiments that helped Obama pick out individual targets. “We were never able to figure out the level of advertising and what they were trying to do,” says McGoldrick. “It wasn’t worth reverse-engineering, because what are you going to do?”","The Community","Although the voter opinion tables that emerged from the Cave looked a lot like polls, the analysts who produced them were disinclined to call them polls. The campaign had plenty of those, generated by a public-opinion team of eight outside firms, and new arrivals at the Chicago headquarters were shocked by the variegated breadth of the research that arrived on their desks daily. “We believed in combining the qual, which we did more than any campaign ever, with the quant, which we [also] did more than any other campaign, to make sure all communication for every level of the campaign was informed by what they found,” says David Simas, the director of opinion research.","Simas considered himself the “air-traffic controller” for such research, which was guided by a series of voter diaries that Obama’s team commissioned as it prepared for the reëlection campaign. “We needed to do something almost divorced from politics and get to the way they’re seeing their lives,” he says. The lead pollster, Joel Benenson, had respondents write about their experiences. The entries frequently used the word “disappointment,” which helped explain attitudes toward Obama’s administration but also spoke to a broader dissatisfaction with economic conditions. “That became the foundation for our entire research program,” says Simas.","Obama’s advisors used those diaries to develop messages that contrasted Obama with Romney as a fighter for the middle class. Benenson’s national polls tested language to see which affected voters’ responses in survey experiments and direct questioning. A quartet of polling firms were assigned specific states and asked to figure out which national themes fit best with local concerns. Eventually, Obama’s media advisors created more than 500 ads and tested them before an online sample of viewers selected by focus-group director David Binder.","But the campaign had to play defense, too. When something potentially damaging popped up in the news, like Democratic consultant Hilary Rosen’s declaration that Ann Romney had “never worked a day in her life,” Simas checked in with the Community, a private online bulletin board populated by 100 undecided voters Binder had recruited. Simas would monitor Community conversations to see which news events penetrated voter consciousness. Sometimes he had Binder show its members controversial material—like a video clip of Obama’s “You didn’t build that” comment—and ask if it changed their views of the candidate. “For me, it was a very quick way to draw back and determine whether something was a problem or not a problem,” says Simas.","When Wagner started packaging his department’s research into something that campaign leadership could read like a poll, a pattern became apparent. Obama’s numbers in key battleground states were low in the analytic tables, but Romney’s were too. There were simply more undecided voters in such states—sometimes nearly twice as many as the traditional pollsters found. A basic methodological distinction explained this discrepancy: microtargeting models required interviewing a lot of unlikely voters to give shape to a profile of what a nonvoter looked like, while pollsters tracking the horse race wanted to screen more rigorously for those likely to cast a ballot. The rivalry between the two units trying to measure public opinion grew intense: the analytic polls were a threat to the pollsters’ primacy and, potentially, to their business model. “I spent a lot of time within the campaign explaining to people that the numbers we get from analytics and the numbers we get from external pollsters did not need strictly to be reconciled,” says Walsh. “They were different.”","The scope of the analytic research enabled it to pick up movements too small for traditional polls to perceive. As Simas reviewed Wagner’s analytic tables in mid-October, he was alarmed to see that what had been a Romney lead of one to two points in Green Bay, Wisconsin, had grown into an advantage of between six and nine. Green Bay was the only media market in the state to experience such a shift, and there was no obvious explanation. But it was hard to discount. Whereas a standard 800-person statewide poll might have reached 100 respondents in the Green Bay area, analytics was placing 5,000 calls in Wisconsin in each five-day cycle—and benefiting from tens of thousands of other field contacts—to produce microtargeting scores. Analytics was talking to as many people in the Green Bay media market as traditional pollsters were talking to across Wisconsin every week. “We could have the confidence level to say, ‘This isn’t noise,’” says Simas. So the campaign’s media buyers aired an ad attacking Romney on outsourcing and beseeched Messina to send former president Bill Clinton and Obama himself to rallies there. (In the end, Romney took the county 50.3 to 48.5 percent.)","For the most part, however, the analytic tables demonstrated how stable the electorate was, and how predictable individual voters could be. Polls from the media and academic institutions may have fluctuated by the hour, but drawing on hundreds of data points to judge whether someone was a likely voter proved more reliable than using a seven-question battery like Gallup’s to do the same. “When you see this Pogo stick happening with the public data—the electorate is just not that volatile,” says Mitch Stewart, director of the Democratic campaign group Organizing for America. The analytic data offered a source of calm.","Romney’s advisors were similarly sanguine, but they were losing. They, too, believed it possible to project the composition of the electorate, relying on a method similar to Gallup’s: pollster Neil Newhouse asked respondents how likely they were to cast a ballot. Those who answered that question with a seven or below on a 10-point scale were disregarded as not inclined to vote. But that ignored the experimental methods that made it possible to measure individual behavior and the impact that a campaign itself could have on a citizen’s motivation. As a result, the Republicans failed to account for voters that the Obama campaign could be mobilizing even if they looked to Election Day without enthusiasm or intensity.","On the last day of the race, Wagner and his analytics staff left the Cave and rode the elevator up one floor in the campaign’s Chicago skyscraper to join members of other departments in a boiler room established to help track votes as they came in. Already, for over a month, Obama’s analysts had been counting ballots from states that allowed citizens to vote early. Each day, the campaign overlaid the lists of early voters released by election authorities with its modeling scores to project how many votes they could claim as their own.","By Election Day, Wagner’s analytic tables turned into predictions. Before the polls opened in Ohio, authorities in Hamilton County, the state’s third-largest and home to Cincinnati, released the names of 103,508 voters who had cast early ballots over the previous month. Wagner sorted them by microtargeting projections and found that 58,379 had individual support scores over 50.1—that is, the campaign’s models predicted that they were more likely than not to have voted for Obama. That amounted to 56.4 percent of the county’s votes, or a raw lead of 13,249 votes over Romney. Early ballots were the first to be counted after Ohio’s polls closed, and Obama’s senior staff gathered around screens in the boiler room to see the initial tally. The numbers settled almost exactly where Wagner had said they would: Obama got 56.6 percent of the votes in Hamilton County. In Florida, he was as close to the mark; Obama’s margin was only two-tenths of a percent off. “After those first two numbers, we knew,” says Bird. “It was dead-on.”","When Obama was reëlected, and by a far larger Electoral College margin than most outsiders had anticipated, his staff was exhilarated but not surprised. The next morning, Mitch Stewart sat in the boiler room, alone, monitoring the lagging votes as they came into Obama’s servers from election authorities in Florida, the last state to name a winner. The presidency was no longer at stake; the only thing that still hung in the balance was the accuracy of the analytics department’s predictions.","The Legacy","A few days after the election, as Florida authorities continued to count provisional ballots, a few staff members were directed, as four years before, to remain in Chicago. Their instructions were to produce another post-mortem report summing up the lessons of the past year and a half. The undertaking was called the Legacy Project, a grandiose title inspired by the idea that the innovations of Obama 2012 should be translated not only to the campaign of the next Democratic candidate for president but also to governance. Obama had succeeded in convincing some citizens that a modest adjustment to their behavior would affect, however marginally, the result of an election. Could he make them feel the same way about Congress?","Simas, who had served in the White House before joining the team, marveled at the intimacy of the campaign. Perhaps more than anyone else at headquarters, he appreciated the human aspect of politics. This had been his first presidential election, but before he became a political operative, Simas had been a politician himself, serving on the city council and school board in his hometown of Taunton, Massachusetts. He ran for office by knocking on doors and interacting individually with constituents (or those he hoped would become constituents), trying to track their moods and expectations.","In many respects, analytics had made it possible for the Obama campaign to recapture that style of politics. Though the old guard may have viewed such techniques as a disruptive force in campaigns, they enabled a presidential candidate to view the electorate the way local candidates do: as a collection of people who make up a more perfect union, each of them approachable on his or her terms, their changing levels of support and enthusiasm open to measurement and, thus, to respect. “What that gave us was the ability to run a national presidential campaign the way you’d do a local ward campaign,” Simas says. “You know the people on your block. People have relationships with one another, and you leverage them so you know the way they talk about issues, what they’re discussing at the coffee shop.”","Few events in American life other than a presidential election touch 126 million adults, or even a significant fraction that many, on a single day. Certainly no corporation, no civic institution, and very few government agencies ever do. Obama did so by reducing every American to a series of numbers. Yet those numbers somehow captured the individuality of each voter, and they were not demographic classifications. The scores measured the ability of people to change politics—and to be changed by it.","You've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nThis is your last free article this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read all your free articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nLog in for more, or subscribe now for unlimited online access.\nLog in for two more free articles, or subscribe now\nfor unlimited online access."],"isopubdate":"2016-02-01"}

Facebook and the wider U.S. tech industry is also under growing pressure at home.","The FTC is looking to see whether Facebook violated terms of a 2011 consent order in which the Menlo Park, Calif., company agreed to get users’ permission for certain changes to privacy settings.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” said Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, before adding “The FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”","Also on Monday, 37 attorneys general, including California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, sent a letter to Facebook asking about the company’s policies for protecting user data and its role in the “manipulation of users’ data by Cambridge Analytica — without those users’ knowledge.”","Lawmakers in Washington are also looking at the issue more closely, including the Senate Judiciary Committee, which asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify April 10 alongside Zuckerberg.","An appearance by the three CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter would stand in contrast to congressional hearings about Russian meddling last year, in which the companies sent lawyers and lower-level executives to testify.","Twitter declined to say whether Dorsey would attend next month’s hearing. Facebook and Google did not respond to a request for comment on the hearing.","ADVERTISEMENT","The office of Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement Monday that the hearing would broadly cover privacy standards for the handling of consumer data used for commercial purposes.","“It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process,” Grassley’s office said.","In lieu of congressional action on user data privacy, the FTC has had to serve as the last line of defense in protecting personal information online. That has become increasingly difficult now that almost every industry relies on consumer data obtained online to inform its decisions — resulting in more instances of hacks and breaches of privacy.","“The FTC was never created as a pure data protection authority, but it’s stepped in to fill the void,” said Woodrow Hartzog, a law and computer science professor at Northeastern University. “Even after all the FTC has done, it’s still very limited in substantive authority and in terms of resources.”","The agency has launched investigations of dozens of tech companies over the years, including Uber, Google, Oracle and Lenovo, one of the world’s largest computer manufacturers.","The result has been more disclosures by the companies about what data they collect, which in itself has become another barrier for consumers.","“It’s like mortgages where you get 500 pages of mandatory disclosures,” said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy. “You need a Ph.D. to figure out where your data goes. If consumers want more control, then consumers have to work harder to figure out what that control means, which defeats the purpose.”","The FTC’s enforcement measures, which are relegated to fines and consent orders, have largely been dismissed as slaps on the wrist for the multibillion-dollar tech companies.","Facebook’s 2011 consent order came after regulators said the company deceived users about how much information it made available to third-party apps, such as a list of all contacts. The order bolstered Facebook’s transparency, but did little to slow the social network’s collection of personal data.","That same year, Google agreed to introduce stronger user privacy policies after settling a case with the FTC, which accused the search giant of exposing users’ Gmail contacts to its now defunct social network, Google Buzz.","A year later, the FTC fined Google $22.5 million for violating that agreement after it was found tracking users on Apple’s Safari internet browser.","In both Facebook’s and Google’s cases, experts say the FTC identified a clear example of consumers being deceived about how their information was being tracked, stored and shared.","It will be harder to determine who is ultimately responsible for the Facebook imbroglio with Cambridge Analytica and the professor who developed the app, Aleksandr Kogan, experts added.","On one hand, Facebook has argued that it informed users who downloaded Kogan’s app that their information and some of their friends’ details would be shared. When Facebook learned that Kogan sold that data to Cambridge Analytica, and in doing so violated the platform’s rules, the company received written assurances from the political consulting firm that the data had been destroyed.","Facebook, however, never informed users their data had been obtained by Cambridge Analytica (Zuckerberg has since pledged to tell them). And it never verified that the data had been destroyed.","In it’s new investigation, the FTC must determine whether Facebook’s response to the data leak amounts to a breach of its 2011 consent order to give “consumers clear and prominent notice” and obtain “consumers’ express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.”","Facebook, which restricted the sharing of user data to third parties in 2015, said it welcomed the new investigation.","The investigation will be closely watched to see whether the FTC expands its oversight to punish companies, not for exploiting user data themselves, but providing the means for third parties to exploit it.","“It seems that the allegation that Facebook is culpable rests on the fact that it was a poor data steward,” said Hartzog of Northeastern. “That is, it failed to properly vet third parties and their data practices. But it’s not entirely clear from the consent order just what the exact threshold of good stewardship and due diligence is.","“The real problem here is that consent order is seemingly aimed at preventing certain kinds of deceptive and unfair practices, but the problem revealed by this incident is that the entire system is ripe for exploitation,” Hartzog continued. “That’s a heavy lift for consent orders.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

(There were a lot more lies, and Part two of my Brexit Lies article is yet to be written) The link to the Lies article is at the end of this article.","MEDIA INTERFERENCE","Soon after the EU Referendum, The Press Gazette, the magazine for journalists, published the findings of a Reuters columnist’s analysis of the UK’s front pages during the 28 days leading up to voting day.","The columnist, Hugo Dixon, claimed that a series of “significantly misleading” articles gave front-page prominence to anti-EU stories, mainly on migration. He said: “I think these helped give a misleading impression to the British public when they voted.”","The Press Gazette itself found that The Sun, The Daily Mail, Express and Telegraph all ran heavily bias pro-Leave stories on their front pages throughout the campaign period.","It said that during this period around 90m newspapers were printed with pro-Leave front pages versus around 30m with pro Remain fronts.”","RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE","A report published by British communications agency 89up.org has concluded that there was significant pro-Brexit Russian influence during the EU referendum campaign.","British Prime Minister Theresa May told Russia that she’s aware they are “weaponising information” but she stopped short of directly accusing the Russian government of targeting the referendum.","But 89up.org’s founder Mike Harris was clear about the role of Russian state media in attempting to influence public opinion.","“What our research shows is that it was the Kremlin state media, Russia Today and Sputnik who pumped out a series of, we found 261 highly leading articles which were all about the refugee crisis or how great the trade deals would be that the UK would get after Brexit,” he said.","“There was a series of very established social media pushes that meant that these articles had more reach on twitter than the two official leave campaigns had combined.”","FACEBOOK INTERFERENCE","89up.org also says Facebook needs to be much more transparent on who spent what on advertising during the 2016 referendum campaign.","“During the period of the UK referendum we need to know who did Facebook take advertising from and they need to make a proper audit to see if any Russian state actors were promoting content that would lead British voters to either conclusion, to remain in the EU or to leave the EU,” Harris said.","Russia has always denied interfering in the referendum campaign and it says it’s been made a scapegoat.","DONALD TRUMP INTERFERENCE","The UK would be “better off without” the European Union, the then US presidential hopeful Donald Trump said before the Referendum..","He told Fox News the migration crisis had been a “horrible thing for Europe” and blamed the EU for driving it.","Trump said he was not making a “recommendation” but his “feeling” was that the UK should vote to sever ties with the EU in the referendum.","Democrat President Barack Obama expressed support for the UK remaining in the EU.","Trump said “I know Great Britain very well, I know the country very well, I have a lot of investments there.”","He added: “I want them to make their own decision.”","Obama said Britain would go to the “back of the queue” for trade deals with the US if it votes to leave the European Union, sparking anger among Leave campaigners in the UK.","He said Britain was at its best when “helping to lead” a strong EU and membership made it a “bigger player” on the world stage.","VOTING BREAKDOWN ACROSS THE UK","England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.

They express our culture and values –\nbut give so much more.","Nearly 10% of our national workforce is in creative industries. They are often\nthe young – and overwhelmingly in small units up and down the UK.","Job growth outpaces every other part of industry – especially in the Midlands\nand Yorkshire.","Their exports total over £35 billion a year, but their added value to our country –\nboth economically and socially – is incalculable … and far beyond cash.","Our decision to leave the EU faces the creative industries with a variety of\nthreats that could harm their future, both in financial and human terms.","So I am delighted to be their guest here this afternoon – to talk of Brexit.","********","For years, the European debate has been dominated by the fringes of opinion –\nby strong supporters of Europe or convinced opponents. But, as we approach\nBrexit, the voice of middle opinion mustn’t be overlooked.","I am neither a Europhile nor a Eurosceptic. As Prime Minister, I said “No” to\nfederal integration, “No” to the Euro Currency, and “No” to Schengen – which\nintroduced free movement of people within the European Union but without\nproper control of external borders.","But I am a realist. I believe that to risk losing our trade advantages with the\ncolossal market on our doorstep is to inflict economic self-harm on the British\npeople.","Of course, the “will of the people” can’t be ignored, but Parliament has a duty\nalso to consider the “wellbeing of the people”.","No-one voted for higher prices and poorer public services, but that is what they\nmay get. The emerging evidence suggests Brexit will hurt most those who have\nleast. Neither Parliament nor Government wish to see that.","The “will of the people” – so often summoned up when sound argument is\nabsent – was supported by only 37% of the electorate. 63% voted either in\nfavour of membership – or did not vote at all.","There was a majority for Brexit, but there was no overwhelming mandate to\nignore the reservations of 16 million voters, who believe it will be a harmful\nchange of direction for our country.","Brexit has been the most divisive issue of my lifetime. It has divided not only\nthe four nations of our UK, but regions within them. It has divided political\nparties; political colleagues; families; friends – and the young from the old.","We have to heal those divisions. They have been made worse by the character\nof the Brexit debate with its intolerance, its bullying, and its name-calling. I\nwelcome rigorous debate – but there must be respect for differing views that are\nhonestly held.","In this debate there are no “remoaners”, no “mutineers”, no “enemies of the\npeople” – just voices setting out what they believe is right for our country.","In recent weeks, the idea has gained ground that Brexit won’t be too bad; that\nwe will all get through it; that we’re doing better than expected – and all will be\nwell.","Of course we will get through it: life as we know it won’t come to an end. We\nare too resourceful and talented a nation for that. But our nation is owed a frank\nassessment of what leaving Europe may mean – for now and the future.","I fear we will be weaker and less prosperous – as a country and as individuals.\nAnd – although it grieves me to admit it – our divorce from Europe will\ndiminish our international stature. Indeed, it already has.","For decades, we British have super-charged our influence around the world by\nour closeness to the US (which policy divisions are lessening); and our\nmembership of the EU (which we are abandoning).","As a result, we are already becoming a lesser actor. Noone – Leaver or\nRemainer – can welcome that.","We are all urged to be “patriotic” and get behind Brexit. But it is precisely\nbecause I am patriotic that I oppose it.","I want my Country to be influential, not isolated; committed, not cut-off; a\nleading participant, not a bystander.","I want us to be richer, not poorer. Yet every serious international body,\nincluding the IMF, the OECD, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the National\nInstitute of Economic and Social Research – as well as Nobel prize-winners –\nforecast we will be poorer outside the EU.","Such forecasts could be wrong, but to dismiss them out of hand is reckless.","Our own Government has assessed our post-Brexit position upon three separate\ncriteria: that we stay in the Single Market; or reach a trade deal with Europe;\nor fail to do so.","Each option shows us to be worse off: and disastrously so with no trade deal at\nall. And the poorest regions will be hurt the most.","If, as negotiations proceed, this analysis appears to be correct, that cannot be\nbrushed aside. I know of no precedent for any Government enacting a policy\nthat will make both our country and our people poorer. Once that is apparent,\nthe Government must change course.","Meanwhile, we are yet again told all will be well. Certainly, the recent fall in\nthe value of Sterling has temporarily boosted our exports. The strength of the\nworld economy may even increase our forecast growth this year.","But this sweet spot is artificial. It won’t last. Prosperity isn’t built on\ndevaluation of the currency. More exports on the back of other countries’\neconomic growth is not a secure position.","The UK has been at the very top of European growth.","We are now the laggard at the bottom. We have become the slowest of the\nworld’s big economies, even before we surrender the familiar advantages of the\nSingle Market.","Our negotiations, so far, have not always been sure-footed. Some agreements\nhave been reached but, in many areas, only because the UK has given ground.","Our determination to negotiate the divorce bill and a new trade deal at the same\ntime was going to be “the fight of the summer” – but instead became an\nimmediate British retreat.","There was to be a “points based” immigration system. There isn’t, and there\nwon’t be.","We were to become the “Singapore of the North”. No more: we have retreated\nfrom a policy of lower taxes and de-regulation.","No transition period was going to be needed. But we have now asked for one –\nduring which we will accept new EU rules, ECJ jurisdiction, and free movement\nof people.","I don’t say this to be critical.","I do so to illustrate that unrealistic aspirations are usually followed by retreat.\nThat is a lesson for the negotiations to come.","They will be the most difficult any Government has faced. Our aims have to be\nrealistic. I am not sure they yet are.","We simply cannot move forward with leaving the EU, the Single Market, the\nCustoms Union and the ECJ, whilst at the same time expecting à la carte,\nbeneficial-to- Britain, bespoke entrance to the European market. It is just not\ncredible.","A willingness to compromise is essential. If either side – the UK or the EU – is\ntoo inflexible, too unbending, too wedded to what they won’t do – then the\nnegotiations will fail.","The very essence of negotiation involves both “give” and “take”. But there are\nalways “red lines” that neither side wishes to cross. In successful negotiations\nthose “red lines” are traded for concessions.","If our “red lines” are held to be inviolable, the likelihood of no deal – or a poor\ndeal – increases. Every time we close off options prematurely, this encourages\nthe EU to do the same – and that is not in our British interest.","A good Brexit – for Britain – will protect our trade advantages, and enable us to:","– continue to sell our goods and services without disruption;","– import and export food without barriers and extra cost;","– staff our hospitals, universities and businesses with the skills we need –\nwhere we most need them;","– be part of the cutting edge of European research, in which British brains\nand skills lead the way;","– continue with the over 40 FTAs we have with countries only as a result of\nour membership of the EU.","A bad Brexit – for Britain – will surrender these, and other, advantages.","For the moment, our self-imposed “red lines” have boxed the Government into a\ncorner.","They are so tilted to ultra Brexit opinion, even the Cabinet cannot agree them –\nand a majority in both Houses of Parliament oppose them. If maintained in full,\nit will be impossible to reach a favourable trade outcome.","Alarmed at the negotiations so far, the financial sector, businesses, and our\nacademic institutions, are pleading for commonsense policy to serve the national\ninterest and now – fearful they may not get it – are making their own\npreparations for the future.","Japanese car-makers warn they could close operations in Britain unless we\nmaintain free access to the EU. That would be heart-breaking for many people\nin Sunderland or Swindon or South Wales.","Any doubters should consult the former employees of factories, now closed, in\nBridgend, Port Talbot and Newport, where jobs were lost and families suffered.\nIn 1991, employment by Japanese firms in Wales was about 17,000 people:\ntoday, it is 2,000. If free access to Europe is lost – that scale of impact, across\nthe UK, could lose 125,000 Japanese jobs.","Over many years, the Conservative Party has understood the concerns of\nbusiness. Not over Brexit, it seems.","Across the United Kingdom – businesses are expressing their wish to stay in the\nSingle Market and Customs Union. But “No”, say the Government’s “red\nlines”.","Businesses wish to have the freedom to employ foreign skills. “No”, say the\nGovernment’s “red lines”.","Business and academia wish to welcome foreign students to our universities\nand – as they rise to influence in their own countries – we then have willing\npartners in politics and business for decades to come. “No”, say the\nGovernment’s “red lines”.","This is not only grand folly. It’s also bad politics.","The national interest must always be above the Party interest, but my Party\nshould beware. It is only fear of Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell that prevents a\nhaemorrhage of business support.","Without the comprehensive trade deal the Prime Minister seeks, we risk\neconomic divorce from the EU, and the chill embrace of a “hard” Brexit with\nWTO rules.","Leading Brexit supporters believe there is nothing to fear from losing our special\naccess to the Single Market.","But that is profoundly wrong. Swapping the Single Market for WTO rules\nwould mean our exports facing the EU external tariff, as well as hidden non-\ntariff barriers that could be adjusted to our disadvantage at any time.","A Minister has speculated we might face tariffs of 3%. Not so.","It is more likely that we will face tariffs on cars (10%), food (14%), drinks\n(20%), and dairy products (36%). Even if a successful negotiation were to halve\nthese tariffs, our exports would still be much more expensive to sell – and this\nwould apply far beyond agriculture and the motor industry.","And if, in retaliation, the UK were to impose tariffs on imports, this would result\nin higher prices for the British consumer.","If we and the EU agreed to impose nil tariffs – as some have speculated – WTO\nrules mean we would both have to offer nil tariffs to all countries. That isn’t\ngoing to happen.","This is all very complex. But it is crucial. And none of it has yet been properly\nexplained to the British people.","There have been attempts to reassure business by claiming that other nations\ntrade with the EU on purely WTO terms. That statement is simply wrong.","China, the US and Japan all have side agreements with Europe on standards,\ncustoms cooperation, mutual recognition and investment. These economic\ngiants did so to protect their own trade even though none of them is exposed as\nwe are – still half our entire exports go to Europe.","Ultra Brexit opinion is impatient to be free of European relationships; to\nbecome – in their words – a “global player”, “sovereign”, “in control”. I believe\nthey are deceiving themselves and, as a result, they are misleading the British\npeople.","Before the modern world took shape – their ambition would have been credible.\nBut the world has changed, the global market has taken root, and – if we are to\ncare for the people of our nation – philosophical fantasies must give way to\nnational self-interest. We cannot prepare for tomorrow by living in the world of\nyesterday.","I don’t doubt the convictions of those who long for the seductive ambition of\nBritish exceptionalism. But these sentiments are out-of- date and, in today’s\nworld, wrong.","It is not my purpose to stir controversy, but the truth must be spoken. The ultra\nBrexiteers have been mistaken – wrong – in nearly all they have said or\npromised to the British people.","The promises of more hospitals, more schools, lower taxes, more money for\ntransport were electioneering fantasy. The £350 million a week for the NHS\nwas a ridiculous phantom: the reality is if our economy weakens – as is\nforecast – there will not only be less money for the NHS, but for all our public\nservices.","We were told that nobody was threatening our place in the Single Market. That\ntune has changed.","We were told that a trade deal with the EU would be easy to get. Wrong again:\nit was never going to be easy, and we are still not sure what outcome will be\nachieved.","We were told “Europe can whistle for their money” and we would not pay a\npenny in exit costs. Wrong again. Europe didn’t even have to purse her lips\nbefore we agreed to pay £40 billion to meet legitimate liabilities.","I could go on. But suffice to say that every one of the Brexit promises is – to\nquote Henry Fielding – “a very wholesome and comfortable doctrine to which\n(there is) but one objection: namely, that it is not true.”.","People should pause and reflect: if the Brexit leaders were wrong in what they\nsaid so enthusiastically before – are they not likely to be wrong in what they say\nnow?","The Prime Minister is seeking a “frictionless” border between Northern Ireland\nand the Republic. She is absolutely right to do so. This is a promise that must\nbe honoured, and I wish her well. But, so far, this has not materialised – nor, I\nfear, will it – unless we stay in “a” or “the” Customs Union.","Those of us who warned of the risks Brexit would bring to the still fragile Peace\nProcess were told at the time that we “didn’t understand Irish politics”. But it\nseems we understood it better than our critics. We need a policy to protect the\nGood Friday Agreement – and we need one urgently. And it is our\nresponsibility to find one – not the European Union.","Although the referendum was advisory only, the result gave the Government the\nobligation to negotiate a Brexit. But not any Brexit; not at all costs; and\ncertainly not on any terms. The true remit can only be to agree a Brexit that\nhonours the promises made in the referendum.","But, so far, the promises have not been met and, probably, cannot be met.","Many electors know they were misled: many more are beginning to realise it.\nSo, the electorate has every right to reconsider their decision.","Meanwhile, our options become ever narrower.","We have ruled out full membership. Ruled out the Single Market and Customs\nUnion. Ruled out joining the European Economic Area. Dismissed talk of\njoining EFTA.","A Norway deal won’t do. Nor will a Swiss deal. Nor a Ukraine deal; a Turkey\ndeal; or a South Korea deal. No, to them all, say the Government’s “red lines”.","So, little is left, except for “cherry picking” – which the EU rejects. Or a\ncomprehensive deal – which will be very hard, if not impossible, to get. So\ncompromise it must be – or no deal at all.","It is now widely accepted that “no deal” would be the worst possible outcome.\nThe compromise must, therefore, focus around our accepting Single Market\nrules (as Norway does) and paying for access.","Or an enhanced “Canada deal” – and it would need to be enhanced a very great\ndeal to be attractive. The Canada deal largely concerns goods – whereas the\nbulk of UK exports are services.","But what we achieve to protect our interests may depend on what we concede:\nit is, as I say, “give” and “take”. If our “red lines” dissolve, our options enlarge.","Our minimum objective must be that “deep, special and bespoke” trade deal the\nPrime Minister has talked about.","So, some unpalatable decisions lie ahead – with the cast-iron certainty that the\nextreme and unbending Brexit lobby will cry “betrayal” at any compromise.\nBut it is Parliament, not a small minority, that must decide our policy.","I spoke earlier of the “divisiveness” of Brexit across our United Kingdom. But,\nin due time, the debate will end and – when it does – we need the highest\npossible level of public acceptance for the outcome. It is in no-one’s interest for\nthe bitterness and division to linger on.","I see only one way to achieve this.","It is already agreed that Parliament must pass legislation giving effect to the\ndeal. A “meaningful vote” has been promised. This must be a decisive vote, in\nwhich Parliament can accept or reject the final outcome; or send the negotiators\nback to seek improvements; or order a referendum.","That is what Parliamentary sovereignty means.","But, to minimise divisions in our country – and between and within the political\nparties – I believe the Government should take a brave and bold decision. They\nshould invite Parliament to accept or reject the final outcome on a free vote.","I know the instinct of every Government is to oppose “free votes”, but the\nGovernment should weigh the advantages of having one very carefully. It may\nbe in their interest to do so.","There are some very practical reasons in favour of it.","Brexit is a unique decision. It will affect the lives of the British people for\ngenerations to come. If it flops – there will be the most terrible backlash.","If it is whipped through Parliament, when the public are so divided, voters will\nknow who to blame if they end up poorer and weaker. So, both democracy and\nprudence suggest a free vote.","The deep divisions in our nation are more likely to be healed by a Brexit freely\napproved by Parliament, than a Brexit forced through Parliament at the behest of\na minority of convinced opponents of Europe.","A free vote would better reflect the reality that – for every 17 voters who opted\nfor Brexit – 16 opted to remain in the EU.","But, regardless of whether a free vote is offered, Parliamentarians must decide\nthe issue on the basis of their own conscience. Upon whether, in mature\njudgement, they really do believe that the outcome of the negotiations is in the\nbest interests of the people they serve.","By 2021, after the likely two-year transition, it will be five years since the 2016\nreferendum. The electorate will have changed. Some voters will have left us.\nMany new voters will be enfranchised. Others may have changed their mind.","No-one can truly know what “the will of the people” may then be. So, let\nParliament decide. Or put the issue back to the people.","And what is true for the House of Commons must apply to the House of Lords.\nPeers must ignore any noises off, and be guided by their intellect and their\nconscience.","I have been a Conservative all my life.","I don’t enjoy being out of step with many in my Party and take no pleasure in\nspeaking out as I am today.","But it’s as necessary to speak truth to the people, as to power.","Leaving Europe is an issue so far-reaching, so permanent, so over-arching that it\nwill have an impact on all our lives – most especially on the young and the\nfuture. With only 12 months to go, we need answers, not aspirations.","This is far more than just a Party issue.

Twelve Russian diplomats at the United Nations in New York and 48 at the Russian Embassy in Washington face expulsion within seven days. The United States also ordered the closure of the Russian Consulate in Seattle.","In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the March 4 attack in Britain was the latest in Russia’s “ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world.”","“With these steps, the United States and our allies and partners make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences,” she said.","Russia’s Foreign Ministry called the expulsions an “unfriendly step” that “will not pass unnoticed.”","Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated Russia’s position that it was not involved in poisoning Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.","“We already stated and reconfirm that Russia has never had any relation to this case,” Peskov said, adding that after an analysis, the Foreign Ministry would propose retaliatory measures for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s consideration.","Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and President Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam on Nov. 11. (Jorge Silva/AFP/Getty Images)","Referring to the call, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said the expulsions go against the “telephone conversation between our two presidents.”","State Department officials said Trump signed off on the recommendation to expel the diplomats but was not heavily engaged in the discussion leading up to Monday’s announcement. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal processes.","The administration last week began considering expulsions of a minimum of 20 diplomats, and State Department and White House officials recommended the higher number, officials said.","White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah did not directly address why Trump has not said anything publicly about the expulsions. Shah noted that while Trump did not raise either the poisoning or potential U.S. retaliation in his call with Putin last week, the president did “secure with Putin on that call some positive interaction when it comes to nuclear arms.”","“Our relationship with Russia is, frankly, up to the Russian government, and up to Vladimir Putin and others in senior leadership in Russia,” Shah said. “We want to have a cooperative relationship. The president wants to work with Russia. But their actions sometimes don’t allow that to happen.”","The close consultation with European allies was particularly striking given the wedge that Trump has driven between the United States and Europe. In the end, European countries ordered 50 Russians to leave.","“It was powerful as a statement had they done it unilaterally, but it was even more powerful in close coordination with our allies,” said Evelyn Farkas, a fellow specializing in national security at the Atlantic Council.","The coordinated expulsions followed a frenetic weekend of calls among the United States and 20 allies that all announced the expulsions almost simultaneously in a broad attempt to disrupt the Kremlin’s intelligence network across Europe. Larger countries such as Canada, France, Germany and Poland ordered four Russian diplomats to leave. Most of the rest ousted only one or two Russians in a largely symbolic gesture of solidarity.","European Council President Donald Tusk said additional measures, including more expulsions, could be coming.","Senior U.S. officials said they believe that the consulate in Seattle, which was ordered to close by April 2, has served as a key outpost in Russia’s intelligence operations, in part because of its proximity to a U.S. submarine base as well as Boeing manufacturing facilities.","The expulsions reflect the downward trajectory of Russia’s relations with the West, already battered by accusations of election interference in the United States and other democracies. The rupture, along with the anticipated Russian tit-for-tat, is the most severe diplomatic crisis between the Kremlin and the West since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, ushering in a punishing set of U.S. and European sanctions.","In Russia, where many people had hoped Trump’s 2016 election would bring a thaw in the chilly relationship, there has been a sharp reevaluation of Trump.","“Many Russians now see no substantial difference between Obama and Trump Administration policies toward their country,” said William Courtney, a retired U.S. diplomat who served in Moscow, writing in an email from his plane shortly after leaving Russia. “This has disappointed many Russians, who had thought that Trump would be more favorable toward Russia than Obama had been.”","Peskov did not answer a question about how the expulsions would affect “the outlook for a Russia-U.S. summit,” the Tass news agency reported. The Kremlin said last week that Putin and Trump had discussed an upcoming meeting in their call, and Trump said they would get together “soon.” But senior administration officials have said there are no plans for a summit.","Antonov said he was called to the State Department at 8 a.m. Monday and informed of the expulsions by Wess Mitchell, assistant secretary of state for Europe. In response, Antonov said, he “stressed that what the United States of America is doing today is they are destroying whatever little is still left in Russia-U.S. relations,” according to Russia’s Interfax news agency.","State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement, “We take these actions to demonstrate our unbreakable solidarity with the United Kingdom, and to impose serious consequences on Russia for its continued violations of international norms.”","The cascade of expulsions drew expressions of gratitude from Britain, which has sought a stiff response to the attack.","“Today’s extraordinary international response by our allies stands in history as the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers ever & will help defend our shared security,” British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter. “Russia cannot break international rules with impunity.”","Russia typically responds to such moves with tit-for-tat measures that expel an equal number of diplomats, sometimes after a delay of several days as the country’s policymakers consider countermeasures. For that reason, small nations that have only a handful of diplomats posted to Russia may refrain from more extensive expulsions.","Russian embassies around the world sometimes use their Twitter accounts to troll their host nations, and Monday was no exception. The Russian Embassy in Washington took to Twitter to crowdsource its response: “US administration ordered the closure of the Russian Consulate in Seattle @GK_Seattle. What US Consulate General would you close in @Russia, if it was up to you to decide”? The tweet included a poll with three options: U.S. consulates in St. Petersburg, Vladivostok and Yekaterinburg.","Michael Birnbaum in Brussels; Ellen Nakashima, Karen DeYoung and Anne Gearan in Washington; Matthew Bodner in Moscow; and Luisa Beck in Berlin contributed to this report."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

It was like a twenty step process, but now that Facebook is seeing a huge hit in profits, suddenly they’re playing nice to those of us thinking of bailing on them. Now, it’s their priority to make those arcane security privacy settings much more accessible with much clearer explanations on how their data tools are used.","Another thing that helped expedite this was the fast-growing #DeleteFacebook movement along with companies quickly distancing themselves from the social media platform after the 50 million user data scandal hit.","“Last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies and help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Facebook vice president and chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, and vice president and deputy general counsel, Ashlie Beringer, said in a statement. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed.","Here are the changes that have been made so you can easily change your Facebook privacy settings. If Zuckerberg and company had only done this years ago, they wouldn’t see their empire veering off course.","Redesigning settings menu","First, Facebook plans to roll out a redesign of its settings menu on mobile devices.

But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place?","The short answer: Because Google let it. The longer answer: Well, it’s complicated.","The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google’s Android system in 2015 — first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn’t collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings.","Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics. The kerfuffle over this data collection, first reported by the website Ars Technica, follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence elections.","There’s a reason Facebook’s actions were restricted to Android phones. Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. “Apple’s fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,” said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.","But Android has long been more indulgent.","Until recently, in fact, Google let app developers gain access to a phone’s call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.","Starting in 2012 with its “Jelly Bean” release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs, but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn’t work.","It wasn’t until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed “Marshmallow,” that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.","That’s the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren’t using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can’t get it even if they want it.","Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.","There are nearly 20,000 Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.","As of January, about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as “Oreo.” (Many of them are owners of Google’s new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)","Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.","All that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?","Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google’s advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.","Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple’s App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did.","Experts say it’s not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it’s very possible.","“In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,” said Bob O’Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. “There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.”","It is unclear how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users’ call logs had been sent to app developers. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.","One major Android phone maker expressed uncertainty over its role in protecting user privacy. “At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,” LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.","Jeffrey Lang has joined Movie TV Tech Geeks for 2015 and will be providing his opinion on technology from across the pond in London.

Anyway, long story short, Facebook exposed data on 50 million Facebook unaware users to a researcher who worked at Cambridge Analytica, which worked for the Trump campaign. But what it sounds scarier is how Cambridge Analytica got these massive data: it seems that, and I quote the New York Times, “Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes”.","After this scandal, a lot of people start to get a little bit more paranoid and start questioning how effectively Facebook handle their data and for what purposes. Online newspapers and magazines didn’t wait too much and start publishing articles as follow:","Web press starting to inform the readers about how to download your Facebook data.","So, I decided to do my homework: I wanna see what kind of information Facebook know about me.","1) Request and download my Facebook data","This process is very straightforward: once I was logged in, I went to “Settings” and clicked the “Download a copy of your Facebook data” button. Doing that, you will send to Facebook a request for your data and after some minutes (< 15 min. in my case) you’ll receive a notification and your files are ready to download.","Let’s examine them.","Requesting a download of my personal Facebook data.","The file I received was a “.zip” file (350 MB, more or less), I extracted it and opened the “index.htm” file.","This is how it looked like:","My personal Facebook data.","As you can see, it’s full of well-categorized information that you can easily search through the side menu: media contents, messages, applications used, and more.","That’s a lot of data, ain’t it?","Some bad things: I found on Twitter some users that claim to also have received back scary data has shown below (this story also appears on The Hacker News when I was writing this post):","Yes, that’s crazy but fortunately it wasn’t my case, I didn’t found any data regarding my phone calls or my SMS sent or received.","“It seems that in older versions of Android when permissions were a lot less strict, the Facebook app took away contact permission at the time of installation that allowed the company access to call and message data automatically.” (The Hacker News)","The title of this category is self-explained and in fact, I was able to retrieve the complete list of my Facebook friends with a huge list of my phone’s contacts, containing also old numbers that I don’t have anymore. It could be useful as a personal back-up, but I didn’t get why a lot of my contact has also their personal email address associated with it.","Facebook Contact Info page.","I’m also sure that all of these emails come directly from Facebook and not from my phone’s contact list: I checked every single email and I found on my phone less than 5% of these contacts. So, they came from Facebook.","In fact, Facebook gives you the opportunity to share your email addresses with:","everyone","just your friends","nobody","For most people sharing their personal emails is not an issue, I mean, that’s only an email address, right?","Here’s when my “blackhat personality” came out.","2) Collecting info and start having fun","I wrote down a script to crawl the HTML page and extract all the emails inside it: I was able to find 585 unique emails.","Some of the emails extracted","A note for the readers: more than one email found could point to a single individual (also the “secondary email” can be exposed from Facebook).","After that, I decided to check if some of these emails were been compromised in a previous data breach with the help of haveibeenpwned API. I wrote a simple Python script that can automatically do this check for me.","Querying haveibeenpwned API.","Some results that I found:","Unique emails: 585","Found on public breaches: 310","Not found in public breaches: 275","So, more than 50% of my emails contacts were been already compromised in a previous data breach (or in more than one). Ok, it will be fun.","This is the list of major breaches involved in descending order:","Adobe: 83","Myspace: 82","Dropbox: 34","LinkedIn: 19","Dailymotion: 17","etc…","At this point, let’s go more deeply and start searching for the passwords. I mean, these breaches are public, right? So the passwords need to be somewhere out there.","3) Passwords, passwords, passwords…","Three months ago on r/pwned subreddit appears what was seemed to be the largest aggregate database found in the dark web to date: these files are well organized and contain 1.4 billion clear text credentials and it was 41GB.

If the last week is anything to go by, he was right.","Since the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans had been harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, it has become increasingly apparent that the social network has been far more lax with its data sharing practices than many users realised.","As the scandal unfurled over the last seven days, Facebook’s lackluster response has highlighted a fundamental challenge for the company: how can it condemn the practice on which its business model depends?","“This is the story we have been waiting for so people will pay attention not just to Facebook but the entire surveillance economy,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","They may now regret it but they knowingly unleashed the forces that have led to this lack of trust and loss of privacy","Since Zuckerberg’s “dumb fucks” comment, Facebook has gone to great lengths to convince members of the public that it’s all about “connecting people” and “building a global community”. This pseudo-uplifting marketing speak is much easier for employees and users to stomach than the mission of “guzzling personal data so we can micro-target you with advertising”.","In the wake of the revelations that Cambridge Analytica misappropriated data collected by Dr Aleksandr Kogan under the guise of academic research, Facebook has scrambled to blame these rogue third parties for “platform abuse”. “The entire company is outraged we were deceived,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.","However, in highlighting the apparent deceit, the company has been forced to shine a light on its underlying business model and years of careless data sharing practices.","Sure, the data changed hands between the researcher and Cambridge Analytica in apparent violation of Kogan’s agreement with Facebook, but everything else was above board. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica got hold of and used to deliver targeted advertising based on personality types – including activities, interests, check-ins, location, photos, religion, politics, relationship details – was not unusual in the slightest. This was a feature, not a bug.","‘Extremely friendly to app developers’","There are thousands of other developers, including the makers of the dating app Tinder, games such as FarmVille, as well as consultants to Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, who slurped huge quantities of data about users and their friends – all thanks to Facebook’s overly permissive “Graph API”, the interface through which third parties could interact with Facebook’s platform.","Facebook opened up in order to attract app developers to join Facebook’s ecosystem at a time when the company was playing catch-up in shifting its business from desktops to smartphones. It was a symbiotic relationship that was critical to Facebook’s growth.","“They wanted to push as much of the conversation, ad revenue and digital activity as possible and made it extremely friendly to app developers,” said Jeff Hauser, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Now they are complaining that the developers abused them. They wanted that. They were encouraging it. They may now regret it but they knowingly unleashed the forces that have led to this lack of trust and loss of privacy.”","The terms were updated in April 2014 to restrict the data new developers could get hold of, including people’s friends’ data, but only after four years of access to the Facebook firehose. Companies that plugged in before April 2014 had another year before access was restricted.","“There are all sorts of companies that are in possession of terabytes of information from before 2015,” said Hauser. “Facebook’s practices don’t bear up to close, informed scrutiny nearly as well as they look from the 30,000ft view, which is how people had been viewing Facebook previously.”","For too long consumers have thought about privacy on Facebook in terms of whether their ex-boyfriends or bosses could see their photos. However, as we fiddle around with our profile privacy settings, the real intrusions have been taking place elsewhere.","“In this sense, Facebook’s ‘privacy settings’ are a grand illusion. Control over post-sharing – people we share to – should really be called ‘publicity settings’,” explains Jonathan Albright, the research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “Likewise, control over passive sharing – the information people [including third party apps] can take from us – should be called ‘privacy settings’.”","Essentially Facebook gives us privacy “busywork” to make us think we have control, while making it very difficult to truly lock down our accounts.","‘The biggest issue I’ve ever seen’","Facebook is dealing with a PR minefield. The more it talks about its advertising practices, the more the #DeleteFacebook movement grows. Even the co-founder of WhatsApp Brian Acton, who profited from Facebook’s $19bn acquisition of his app, this week said he was deleting his account.","“This is the biggest issue I’ve ever seen any technology company face in my time,” said Roger McNamee, Zuckerberg’s former mentor.","“It’s not like tech hasn’t had a lot of scandals,” he said, mentioning the Theranos fraud case and MiniScribe packing actual bricks into boxes instead of hard drives. “But no one else has played a role in undermining democracy or the persecution of minorities before. This is a whole new ball game in the tech world and it’s really, really horrible.”","Facebook first discovered that Kogan had shared data with Cambridge Analytica when a Guardian journalist contacted the company about it at the end of 2015. It asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and revoked Kogan’s apps’ API access. However, Facebook relied on Cambridge Analytica’s word that they had done so.","Left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency","When the Observer contacted Facebook last week with testimony from a whistleblower stating that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted the data, Facebook’s reaction was to try to get ahead of the story by publishing its own disclosure late on Friday and sending a legal warning to try to prevent publication of its bombshell discoveries.","Then followed five days of virtual silence from the company, as the chorus of calls from critics grew louder, and further details of Facebook’s business dealings emerged.","A second whistleblower, the former Facebook manager Sandy Parakilas, revealed that he found Facebook’s lack of control over the data given to outside developers “utterly horrifying”. He told the Guardian that he had warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach, but that he was discouraged from investigating further.","At around the same time, it emerged that the co-director of the company that harvested the Facebook data before passing it to Cambridge Analytic is a current employee at Facebook. Joseph Chancellor worked alongside Kogan at Global Science Research, which exfiltrated the data using a personality app under the guise of academic research.","Demand for answers","Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic called for answers. In the US, the Democratic senator Mark Warner called for regulation, describing the online political advertising market as the “wild west”.","“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","The people owned the web, tech giants stole it. This is how we take it back | Jonathan Freedland","“I think they are in a very bad situation because they have long benefitted from the tech illiteracy of the political community,” said Hauser.","The backlash spooked investors, wiping almost $50bn off the valuation of the company in two days, although the stock has since rallied slightly.","On Wednesday, Zuckerberg finally broke his silence in a Facebook post acknowledging that the policies that allowed the misuse of data were a “breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it”.","The social network is facing calls for answers from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.

{"originalurl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/06/tories-pumping-facebook-advertising-email-ukip","title":"Tories pumping £100,000 a month into Facebook advertising | Politics | The Guardian","text":["This promotion, dropped in to the middle of news feeds otherwise full of drunken selfies and baby pics, did not come cheap for the Tories.","That and other adverts pumped out on Facebook, including some allowing users to hand over their email addresses, are costing the party a whopping £100,000 a month, or £1.2m if continued for a whole year. Put another way: one in every £17 the Tories spent on the last general election campaign is going towards drumming up support on Facebook.","Tory Facebook post: ‘Like David Cameron’s new Facebook page for the latest updates from the prime minister.’","The party has been mercilessly mocked this week for appearing to try to “buy” friends for the prime minister. But the Tories’ social media push does have a point. The site is an effective new method of bombarding voters with political messaging, given that there are about 35 million users in the UK – more than the number of people who voted in the last general election. The majority of these people check into the site daily.","Facebook allows electoral strategists to get ordinary users to do the parties’ hard work for them by sharing or endorsing political messages with friends and family – thought to be be a much more effective form of social pressure than a slogan coming directly from a politician.","On top of that, as US data gurus realised in the last presidential campaign, the social network is an unrivalled source of gaining information on voters.","Email addresses are a holy grail, which is why the Tories have several non-party branded websites aimed at sucking in data, like Justnotuptoit.com, registered to Tory HQ. The red website confronts a reader with a map of Labour figures criticising Ed Miliband, then invites users to say what they think of the Labour leader as well as providing their contact details – only mentioning in tiny small print at the bottom that it is promoted by one Alan Mabbutt on behalf of the Conservatives.","Justnotuptoit.com only mentions in small print that it is promoted on behalf of the Conservatives.","Invoices show the vast bulk of Tory Facebook advertising was actually spent on “email collection” like this: enticing users to sign up to a mailing list by asking them if they want more information on what the prime minister is up to or on policies such as Help to Buy.","The size of the Conservative mailing list is unknown, but those who have signed up now get attention-grabbing emails that appear to come directly from George Osborne or Cameron, addressing recipients by their first names and appealing personally for their support.","On top of that, once someone has been identified as a potential supporter, his or her Facebook page is a detailed source of data about age, location, job, habits and preoccupations, prized information for the parties as they seek to to tailor their messages to specific groups. This can even be cross-referenced with existing voter databases, which might be able to work out if the user is in a marginal seat.","Although it is using the same personalised email tactics as the Tories, Labour claims a little wistfully that it cannot afford to spend the big bucks on rounding up Facebook support. Its monthly Facebook bill is understood to be about £10,000.","Party officials claim the cash goes towards adverts aimed at small-scale fundraising and asking people to become members, not trying to boost the popularity of their leader through “likes”. They do, however, acknowledge that the Conservative deluge of online messaging can be effective.","Matthew McGregor, of Blue State Digital, who advised Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign on new media and is now working with the Labour party, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The Conservatives are spending their money in a way that gets their content in front of people.","“The fact they are outspending the Labour party many, many times over because of the support from millionaire donors is going to have an impact. That’s something the Labour party can respond to by out-organising the Conservatives.”","What must be galling for the Tories, though, is that some of the smaller parties are building up a groundswell of social media support seemingly without the need for expensive promotions. Ukip, for example, is able to boast that it has been spending only “in the hundreds of pounds” on Facebook ads, mostly aimed locally at users who might want to attend political town hall meetings.","Raheem Kassam, one of Nigel Farage’s closest aides, who has expertise in social media, said: “What you might call cyber-Kippers are a lot more naturally active than those of the other parties” – in a similar way to the online army of SNP activists during the Scottish referendum debate. He puts this down to Ukip’s encouragement of “vocal dissent” and the idea that “the disaffected are more likely to be active online”.","Breakdown of content discussed on Conservative party’s Facebook page, by analytics site\nWe Are Social","“We do encourage people to share and get the message out but there isn’t any structure in place,” said Kassam. “If I had my choice, I would have every single Kipper active on social media in an email list and email them every time we had something to put out but we just don’t have the resources. It is an entirely natural phenomenon. It’s the same with the SNP – I think people are just taking it upon themselves.”","One driver behind Ukip’s strong Facebook presence is that local branches of the party tend to have Facebook pages, allowing members to interact, in contrast to the static, identikit websites of most Conservative associations.","Social community growth from the We Are Social website.","Data from the analytics site We Are Social bears out this trend of minor party supporter engagement on Facebook. Despite the Tories’ large outlay, they tied with the Greens in terms of the growth of their social communities, both gaining 7% in support for the last three months of 2014. Ukip beat them both, with a rise of 8%.","“Their engagement rates are really low considering how much they are spending,” says Kassam. “If I were their party treasurer, I would be looking at that and realising I was spending about £50 per like. We are spending just 13p to 20p.”"],"isopubdate":"2015-02-06"}

The decline has dragged down the tech-skewing Nasdaq index and other markets.]","Facebook shares fell more than 4% in premarket trading Monday after reports over the weekend that a data-analytics firm that worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign improperly obtained access to information on more than 50 million users.","According to reports by the New York Times and the U.K.’s Guardian, the consulting company — Cambridge Analytica — had gotten hold of data on 50 million Facebook users, without their knowledge or consent. The reports also said the data had not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands that the firm do so as far back as 2015.","On Saturday, Facebook denied that the Cambridge Analytica situation constituted a “data breach.” It also said that Cambridge Analytica did not use any of the Facebook data in question as part of its work on behalf of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Even so, the case highlights the fact that the processes Facebook had in place allowed the data to be shared beyond what it had authorized. The company now faces a greater regulatory risk as a result of the disclosure, while third-party ad measurement partners may face more restrictions, according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.","Related","“We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” Wieser wrote in a research note Sunday. However, he added, “the company’s business won’t likely be meaningfully impacted for now because we don’t think advertisers will suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform.”","According to Facebook, University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan lied to Facebook and violated its terms of service by passing on the data from an app that was using the Facebook login feature to Cambridge Analytica.","“Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent,” Paul Grewal, Facebook VP and deputy general counsel, wrote in a statement on the company’s blog site on Saturday. “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","According to Facebook, it currently puts all apps requesting detailed user information through an app review process that requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it.","Facebook announced late Friday that it was suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories and its Cambridge Analytica division from using the social platform. Cambridge Analytica, which according to its website “uses data to change audience behavior,” has offices in London, New York, and Washington, D.C. Per the Times, Cambridge Analytica provided various services for Trump’s 2016 election campaign, including “designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals” as well as modeling voter turnout in U.S. states to inform TV ad buying.","[UPDATE: Facebook said in a blog post later Monday that it hired digital-forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica; the company said Cambridge Analytica has agreed to cooperate.]","Kogan created an app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” that offered personality predictions and advertised itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Around 270,000 people downloaded the app, granted access to data such as the city they set on their profile or Facebook content they had liked, as well as some limited information about friends who had privacy settings that allowed that sharing. Hence, through the 270,000 users who opted in to Kogan’s app, he was able to access data on 50 million-plus Facebook users.","“Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal wrote.","Facebook will take “legal action if necessary” against Cambridge Analytica or others involved, Grewal added.","About Us","Breaking News Home\nHome Of Information Around The World.","Is an advanced news hub, which covers all sphere of news line.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Related Coverage","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted.”","FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is seen at the Facebook Gather conference in Brussels, Belgium January 23, 2018.

Her friend Linda Leonhart agrees: “I will definitely take a look to see who has the courage to take on a job like this and do what needs to be done.”CreditCreditAllison V. Smith for The New York Times","By Michael Tackett","March 11, 2018","GRAPEVINE, Tex. — Carol Rains, a white evangelical Christian, has no regrets over her vote for President Trump. She likes most of his policies and would still support him over any Democrat. But she is open to another Republican.","“I would like for someone to challenge him,” Ms. Rains said, as she sipped wine recently with two other evangelical Christian women at a suburban restaurant north of Dallas. “But it needs to be somebody that’s strong enough to go against the Democrats.” Her preferred alternative: Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador and former South Carolina governor.","One of her friends, Linda Leonhart, agreed. “I will definitely take a look to see who has the courage to take on a job like this and do what needs to be done,” she said.","According to data from the Pew Research Center, support among white evangelical women in recent surveys has dropped about 13 percentage points, to 60 percent, compared with about a year ago. That is even greater than the eight-point drop among all women.","“That change is statistically significant,” said Gregory A. Smith, Pew’s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. “Both groups have become less approving over time.”","If that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama’s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.","The women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.","“Certainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,” said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women’s ministry at her church.","A clear majority of white evangelical women, even in the face of the #MeToo movement and renewed claims of marital infidelity against the president, continue, along with white evangelical men, to form Mr. Trump’s most cohesive block of support.","Mr. Trump’s ability to connect so strongly with evangelical voters was among the most notable surprises of the 2016 campaign. Since his election, he has courted evangelical leaders aggressively and, more important, has delivered on promises to appoint conservatives like Justice Gorsuch to federal courts. Men who see themselves as leaders of religious conservatives, such as Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, have remained doggedly supportive.","And the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.","But it has not been easy.","“I don’t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,” said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of “The Reconnect,” an evangelical-centered radio show.","“Many things the president says and does are things that many evangelicals use as examples with our kids of what we should not do,” added Ms. LaBerge, who did not support Mr. Trump in 2016. “This is not who we are as evangelicals. This is not how we treat people.”","Some evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.","They feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children’s schools, even at their church. They meet in secret and have a private Facebook group, which its organizer said has about 160 members, to talk about their support for Mr. Trump.","They said that Christian voters who backed Trump had been derided as unthinking, unsophisticated hypocrites, but for many of them that only affirmed their resolve. One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.","“I would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,” said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. “I’ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.”","Still, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.","“At least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,” Ms. LaBerge said.","Karen Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, “Now that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn’t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.”","“I was one of those culture war evangelicals in the ’80s and ’90s,” Ms. Swallow Prior said. “I was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn’t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.”","Evangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.","“I think they’ve become experienced and very practical,” said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book “The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.” “By large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It’s ‘We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he’s going to do it if we turn out and vote.’”","Mr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. “Religious right rhetoric has always been very martial — isolationist and martial at the same time,” Ms. FitzGerald said.","In surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company’s executive director.","Evangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.","And even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.","“It may simply be that there’s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the ‘Oh Lord, I can’t stand another one of these,’” said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of “With God on Our Side,” which charted the political rise of the religious right.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: White Evangelical Women, Core Trump Supporters, Are Tiptoeing Away.

He has encouraged developers to connect apps and programs to Facebook’s platform.CreditCreditJeff Roberson/Associated Press","In 2007, a young Mark Zuckerberg stood on a stage in San Francisco and announced that Facebook was throwing open its doors.","No longer, he said, would Facebook be a closed-off software product like every other social network. Instead, it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it.","“We want to make Facebook into something of an operating system,” Mr. Zuckerberg told a reporter.","At the time, the announcement drew little notice outside the programming world. Developers quickly went to work making fun and quirky apps that plugged into Facebook — early hits included “Rendezbook,” a kind of proto-Tinder that allowed users to match with each other for “random flings,” and CampusRank, which allowed college students to nominate their peers for yearbook-type awards.","Later, popular games like FarmVille arrived, and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials. In some ways, it was a fair trade. Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users’ internet habits, and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users. In all, millions of apps have been created with Facebook’s open platform tools.","Through it all, Facebook’s users were mostly unfazed. Sure, these apps collected data about their lives. But they seemed convenient and harmless, and, really, what could go wrong?","Today, more than a decade later, the consequences of Facebook’s laissez-faire approach are becoming clear. Over the weekend, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm, improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users, and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.","What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn’t technically a data breach, since this trove of personal information wasn’t stolen from Facebook’s servers. Rather, it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called “thisisyourdigitallife.”","That app, which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor, collected data about the 270,000 people who installed it, along with data about their Facebook friends, totaling 50 million people in all. The professor, Aleksandr Kogan, then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica.","Technically, only this last step violated Facebook’s rules, which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third-party app. The rest was business as usual. Third-party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day, including their ages, location, pages they’ve liked and groups they belong to. Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information, but it’s unclear how many do.","This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook, which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform. Permissiveness is a feature, as they say, not a bug.","But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica, some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2.2 billion registered users.","“It seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people’s data,” said Can Duruk, a technology consultant and software engineer. Facebook, he said, was “extremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get.”","In a Facebook post on Monday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake.","“We thought that every app could be social,” Mr. Bosworth wrote. “Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures. It was a reasonable vision but it didn’t materialize the way we had hoped.”","An early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook’s third-party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel, then at The Wall Street Journal, reported that an online tracking company, RapLeaf, was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third-party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants. In response, Facebook cut off RapLeaf’s data access and said it would “dramatically limit” the misuse of its users’ personal information by outside parties.","But preventing data-hungry developers from exploiting Facebook’s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging. In 2015, Facebook removed the ability of third-party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app, citing privacy concerns. (Cambridge Analytica’s data trove, which included this type of information, was gathered in 2014, before the change.) Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications.","But the core functions of Facebook’s open platform tool are still intact. There are still many third-party apps like “thisisyourdigitallife” out there, vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users. That data doesn’t disappear, and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.","Not all open data access is used irresponsibly. Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook’s third-party development tools to respond to natural disasters. And many of the functions that internet users depend on — for example, the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app — are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third-party development known as application programming interfaces, or A.P.I.s.","“Everything we depend on uses A.P.I.s,” said Kin Lane, a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist. “They’re in your home, in your business, in your car. It’s how these platforms innovate and do cool, interesting things.”","In Facebook’s case, permissive data policies were also good for business. Third-party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook’s platform, giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company. Restricting access to data would limit Facebook’s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead, making those products better.","In this context, it’s even less surprising that Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans. After all, why else would the quiz be there?","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: How Did Data Sharing Go From Feature to Bug On Facebook?.

But to get there he’ll have to battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who exploit and hijack groups to make money or sow chaos.","One week after the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, those searching on Facebook for information about the upcoming March for Our Lives were likely to be shown an active group with more than 50,000 members.","Called “March for Our Lives 2018 Official,” it appeared to be one of the best places to get details about the event and connect with others interested in gun control. But those who joined the group soon found themselves puzzled. The admins often posted pro-gun information and unrelated memes and mocked those who posted about gun control.","“I'm a retired federal law enforcement special agent. There is and never has been any reason for a civilian to have a high-capacity high velocity weapon,” posted one member on Feb. 20.","“Shutup fed and stop trying to spread your NWO BS,” was the top reply, which came from one of the group’s admins. (NWO is a reference to the “new world order” conspiracy theory.)","A few days later the group’s name was changed to “Kim Jong Un Fan Club,” and members continued to wonder what was going on.","The simple answer is they were being trolled. The more complicated one is that while Facebook groups may offer a positive experience for millions of people around the world, they have also become a global honeypot of spam, fake news, conspiracies, health misinformation, harassment, hacking, trolling, scams, and other threats to users, according to reporting by BuzzFeed News, findings from researchers, and the recent indictment of 13 Russians for their alleged efforts to interfere in the US election.","“This vision could backfire terribly: an increase in the weight of ‘groups’ means reinforcement of Facebook’s worst features — cognitive bubbles — where users are kept in silos fueled by a torrent of fake news and extremism,” wrote Frederic Filloux, coauthor of the influential weekly media commentary newsletter Monday Note.","“Propagandists and spammers need to amass an audience, and groups serve that up on a platter. There’s no need to run an ad campaign to find people receptive to your message if you can simply join relevant groups and start posting,” she said.","To her point, the recent indictment of the 13 Russians repeatedly cited Facebook groups as a focus of workers at the Internet Research Agency.","“By 2016, the size of many organization-controlled groups had grown to hundreds of thousands of online followers,” the indictment said.","One part of the Russian effort on Facebook left unmentioned in the Mueller indictment — and that has not previously been reported — is that Facebook’s group recommendation system encouraged fans of troll-run pages such as Blactivist and Heart of Texas to organize themselves into groups based on their shared affinity for a page. To this day there remain many groups with automatically generated names such as “Friends Who Like Blacktivist” or “Friends Who Like Heart of Texas.” These groups appear to be small and inactive, but the fact remains that Facebook prompted Americans to organize into fan groups of Russian troll pages.","There’s no question that groups offer value to many Facebook users. They keep friends and former classmates close, and played a key role in helping organize the West Virginia teachers’ strike. They are the basis for a thriving global community of buy, sell, and barter networks. Groups were used to raise money for victims of the Las Vegas shooting, and help provide support to, and prevent suicide among, US military personnel. Facebook groups can restrict membership by being designated “secret” or “closed,” and as a result people often share deeply personal information and experiences because they feel protected from the prying eyes of search engines and the public at large.","That’s the case for Female IN, a secret Facebook group that today boasts a membership of more than 1.5 million women around the world. It was created by Lola Omolola, a Nigerian-born journalist now living in Chicago. She started it after more than 250 schoolgirls were kidnapped by a terrorist group in Nigeria. Many of the women in the group live in, or are originally from, African countries. But Omolola said it has grown to include women from other parts of the world.","Secret groups like FIN are completely invisible to anyone who is not a member, and Facebook users can only join if they are invited by a current member. This is different from closed groups, which can be found via search, show up on user profiles, and enable anyone to request to be added to the group.","“We discuss everything from everyday day stuff like your children, your healthcare, and your individual interactions with people. We go from there to talking about domestic violence. People are sharing in real time what happens at their homes,” Omolola told BuzzFeed News in an interview facilitated by Facebook’s PR team. “Generally we are very actively and thoughtfully healing a population of women who are used to being silenced, and whose voices have never really historically mean that much.”","But even a group that Facebook itself points to as an example of the product’s value has to wage a battle against bad actors. Omolola and other FIN admins work constantly to keep men and spammers out of the group. They have to warn members about imposter FIN groups on Facebook that try to leverage her group’s success and brand among women. A post to the public FIN Facebook page from last fall warned women of a “FAKE FIN run by A MAN!!!”","“Some people try to use the [FIN] name to get a lot of people to their groups,” Omolola said. “We have contacted Facebook and Facebook knows about it, and are working on ways to protect us.”","Omolola says she working on trademarking the group’s name so she can ask Facebook can enforce her trademark and take imposter groups down faster. Right now, it’s mostly up to her and her members to go into fake FIN groups and warn people that it’s a scam.","Jennifer Dulski, the head of groups and community at Facebook, told BuzzFeed News that there is now a dedicated “integrity” team for groups, which includes people who specialize in security, product, machine learning, and content moderation. She pointed to new tools launched last year that help admins screen and easily remove members, and that lets admins clearly state the rules of a given group on its About page. (Omolola said these new features are all big time savers.)","“There is some negative content and behavior happening on Facebook, including in groups, and we take that really seriously,” Dulski said.","She emphasized that the the experience for most users is positive.","“It’s amazing to see what is actually happening in Facebook groups, and the vast majority of of activity and content in these groups is not only positive but also meaningful for the people involved in them.”","DiResta sees a parallel, suggesting groups are at the same stage pages and the News Feed were prior to Facebook’s 2016 wake-up call about fake news: rife with manipulation and lacking proper oversight.","“We need to avoid a repeat of the kind of persuasive manipulation we saw on pages, so Facebook needs to be pay attention to these issues as they continue to increase their emphasis on groups,” DiResta said.","That emphasis on groups is now a cornerstone of Zuckerberg’s vision for the company and product. Last summer he announced an ambitious goal to drastically increase the number of Facebook users in “meaningful” groups from 100 to 1 billion.","“If we can do this, it will not only turn around the whole decline in community membership we've seen for decades, it will start to strengthen our social fabric and bring the world closer together,” he said in a speech at Facebook’s first Community Summit last summer.","But to get to a billion, Facebook will have to acknowledge and battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who constantly exploit, take over, and buy and sell groups in order to make money or sow chaos. It will also have to confront the fact that its own recommendation engine at times pushes users into conspiracy theorist groups, or into those geared toward trolling, harassment, or illicit online activity.","The global exploitation of groups","As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, members of a Facebook group called Republicans Suck suddenly experienced an influx of new members who spammed the group with links to questionable stories on websites they’d never heard of.","Bobby Ison, a Kentucky man who was member of the group, told BuzzFeed News that he noticed the administrators and moderators of the group began to change and “some of them were obvious foreign accounts. Eastern European countries. Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia.”","Ison said he and others learned that the Facebook account of one of the group’s original admins had been hacked. With control of the admin’s Facebook profile, the hackers were then able to add whoever they wanted as admins, and remove the group’s original leaders.","“When they got his [account], they booted the other admins, and moved more of theirs in,” Ison said. “It was rather sad to witness.” (The admin whose account Ison said was hacked did not respond to inquiries from BuzzFeed News.)","Eventually, former admins and members fled to start a new, closed group called","“As some of you know, the old REPUBLICANS SUCK has been hacked and taken over by hackers and trolls, which is something that is happening in several groups,” reads the pinned message for the group from one of its administrators.","Ison said the old group’s new overseas admins stepped up their spamming efforts in order to drive traffic from the group to their sites, presumably so they could earn ad revenue.","“It turned into a horrible page after they finally took over. Posting some of the most outlandish stories I've seen,” he said.","BuzzFeed News spoke via Facebook Messenger with one of the profiles currently listed as an admin of the group. That account has previously posted online about a Ford van for sale in Macedonia and written posts in Macedonian. Many of the account’s earliest posts in groups were for online moneymaking schemes. The person running the account said they were only added as an admin of the group two months earlier and didn't know anything about the group takeover last year.","“For the first time I hear from you that this group is stolen,” they wrote. They said they are not profiting in any way from the group. (BuzzFeed News could not confirm whether the profile’s name is linked to a real person.)","“We have no interest, we have no profit, we do not do with advertisements,” they said, and offered to make a BuzzFeed News reporter an admin of the group as a sign of goodwill.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups.\"","BuzzFeed News previously documented how political Facebook groups were exploited to spread political fake news to Americans during the 2016 election and beyond. An article published on Election Day revealed that Macedonian spammers used fake profiles to spam Trump and Bernie Sanders groups to generate engagement for their often false pro-Trump stories.","The tactic of spamming groups is by no means restricted to US politics or those targeting US audiences.","Rappler, an independent news website in the Philippines, last month published a story about a seemingly fake Facebook profile that spammed groups with links to websites that carried positive news about President Rodrigo Duterte. At one point the profile took over a fan group for a South Korean actor and changed its name to “President Duterte Supporters.”","Rappler found that the account posted hundreds of links to pro-Duterte news in Facebook groups since last summer. “She had also posted 307 times in various groups linking to a website called ‘Philippine Republic News’ which carries fake stories such as Oprah's support for President Duterte,” the story said.","A report on troll farms and fake news in the Philippines by two researchers included a case study showing that paid trolls tasked with helping win an election “came up with fake profiles and populated a Facebook group dedicated to the city they were trying to win.”","Facebook groups are also an engine of misinformation in Myanmar. Thura, a worker with a Myanmar social media research organisation, told BuzzFeed News by email that “Facebook groups are being used widely to spread hatred.” (BuzzFeed News agreed to conceal his identity due to security and safety concerns related to the work he does in Myanmar.)","Thura said people are using groups to spread hate and misinformation because they’re aware that less of the content posted to pages will reach the News Feed. So they focus on groups as a cheaper and more reliable way to reach people.","“Since Facebook pages do not normally go into News Feed unless they pay ads, groups are a good way to raise visibility of some of the fake news,” Thura wrote. “Groups are also a good strategy for [generating] engagement for a post from a page, meaning once a page posts a content, their network share them in several different groups.”","Spamming fake stories into groups is also the preferred tactic of American fake news publishers. Jestin Coler is a California man who ran more than a dozen early fake news sites such as National Report starting in 2013. He exited the fake news game last year and now says he’s focused on trying to use his experience to help battle online misinformation. Coler told BuzzFeed News that spamming groups was, and continues to be, a key traffic strategy for fake stories — and it’s still not being dealt with by Facebook.","“Joining Facebook groups that are related to the content being promoted, then spamming links throughout those groups using various aliases, is quite effective,” he said. “Members of the group then essentially become ‘bots’ and often share content to their network (outside of the group) creating a more organic-looking campaign.”","Coler said it was standard practice to identify specific Facebook groups related to the topic of a fake story and then join them all at once to enable link spamming.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups,” he said.","His lack of knowledge of American pop culture also caused him to share the link in a group dedicated to the TV show It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He apparently thought it was a group focused on the city. (He did not reply to requests for comment at the time.) One town in Kosovo is also home to a network of groups that spread fake news to Americans, according to a recent report by Media Matters.","Facebook’s intention to give even more visibility to group content in the News Feed will now make this tactic even more appealing. It could also result in more takeovers of groups. There’s evidence this is already happening.","Two weeks after Facebook announced its latest News Feed algorithm changes, former admins and members of “Mystic Fire Native Heart,” a group with tens of thousands of members, began posting to warn that it had been taken over by hackers from Eastern Europe.","Keyword squatting and targeted harassment","Another tactic that could become more frequent with the elevation of groups by Facebook is what researcher Joan Donovan calls “keyword squatting.” The group that changed its name to “March for Our Lives 2018 Official” in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is a perfect example. That group has over time gained tens of thousands of members thanks to the admins changing its title to different topical names that are likely to attract new members.","When Stephen Hawking died last week the group changed its name to “RIP STEPHEN HAWKING 2018” and as a result showed up as a top three result in a groups search for “stephen hawking.”","Facebook","“This is a feature that they have learned to leverage and you can imagine if they have learned to do it there are hundreds if not thousands of other groups changing the keyword weekly in order to get attention,” said Donovan, who leads the media manipulation project for the research institute Data & Society. (Facebook declined to comment on that group’s tactics.)","Thura said keyword squatting is a common tactic in Myanmar, too. People will start a Facebook group with a topic that has broad appeal and is not connected to news. Then, once it’s gained enough members, the admins switch its name and start sharing false stories.","“The strategy they used often is that they start with a different name and then once they have a large amount of users, they change it to a different name such as ‘Let’s Share News’ group,” Thura said.","Dulski, who oversees groups at Facebook, said the company has invested in new tools to enable group members to report content that may violate the terms of service, or a group’s specific rules.","“One is tool for members to report posts that might be violating the rules, and they can report this to the admins of the group and to Facebook,” she said. “This allows admins to quickly and easily review and keep bad content from appearing.”","In cases of hate speech or offensive content, Dilski said Facebook uses machine learning to automatically flag posts that may be violating the terms of service, regardless of whether people report it or not.","Thura said he and other have found it’s often pointless to flag content or complain to group admins about fake news since they’re often the ones spreading it.","There are in fact groups that exist solely to engage in activities that violate Facebook’s terms of service. One group, Republic of Kekistan, amassed more than 30,000 members before being removed by Facebook earlier this year. BuzzFeed News joined the group last year and watched as members coordinated online harassment campaigns, most of which were targeted at trans women and left-leaning Facebook pages. The group was also home to hate speech, such as a post where one member posted a photo of a handgun and asked, \"What kind of Muslim repellant do y'all carry?\"","Facebook","The process for planning raids was simple: One group member shared a link to a piece of content they didn’t agree with and added the word “raid” to signal like-minded members to flood the comments of the content in question with nasty, often hate-filled messages and other types of trolling. Some calls for raids went unnoticed by the rest of the group, but others funneled dozens of hateful comments to unsuspecting victims.","At one point, a post in the group asked members to “raid the comments” of a fundraising post for the family of Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed during the Charlottesville demonstrations last year. Another post encouraged members to post laughing reactions to a Facebook post about a trans teen who committed suicide (The group’s description page at one point warned members, “No raid posts allowed. The safety of the nation must be guarded against retaliatory attacks.” But it appeared that policy was enforced loosely, if at all.)","BuzzFeed News","Planning coordinated online attacks is against Facebook policy, but members of Republic of Kekistan seemingly stayed under Facebook’s radar and went unpunished for months. Sophie Labelle, a cartoonist from Montreal and a trans woman, was targeted last May. Labelle writes a web comic called Assigned Male and is the author of several comic books about being trans. Labelle told BuzzFeed News she’s used to the online harassment that comes with being a trans public figure, but this was an extreme case.","Trolls posted her home address online and she had to move. Labelle said her roommate, who’s also trans, felt threatened too. The trolls also targeted a bookstore hosting her launch and as a result it was canceled. (That raid worked out in Labelle's favor: the added attention helped her book sell out its first printing.)","“I feel pretty powerless. It’s kind of a given that when you show support to me it makes you a target,” she said.","Labelle said there are conspiracy theories about her online and even her readers are sometimes targeted if they leave a comment on one of her social media posts.","Labelle suspects Republic of Kekistan was behind the May harassment, but she does not know for sure. As payback, her supporters decided to band together to coordinate mass-reporting of the Facebook group for violating the platform’s terms of service, and Facebook eventually shut it down temporarily that same month. The group reemerged at some point after the ban and was active again as recently as January, according to an online archive. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about when and why Republic of Kekistan was taken offline.","A marketplace of black hat groups services","Groups have become attractive enough for both legitimate and bad actors that there’s now a flourishing online marketplace of apps and services related to exploiting them.","There are multiple software apps that can automate posting links in groups and also automate the process of joining groups and inviting other profiles into them. For a small fee, you can buy new members to make your group seem more popular than it is, pay to spam a link of your choosing in groups with large numbers of members to try to drive traffic, or hire someone to go into a group and capture the email addresses of members in order to enable further spamming and targeting.","All of the aforementioned services violate Facebook’s terms of service, but they are easily found with a simple online search, or by going to a freelancing site such as Fiverr. Many of these services are offered by people based in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India.","“Looking for a Facebook promotion expert to help you post and promote your products, services to millions of real and active Facebook group members ???” read one recent Fiverr ad. “Search no more.I am here to give you full expert service that will promote your ads or links to about 40 million real and active Facebook group members.”","To learn how these providers add hundreds or thousands of members to groups, BuzzFeed News purchased a total of 6,000 members for three groups it set up. One person on Fiverr charged $6 to provide 5,000 members for a group. BuzzFeed News then purchased two more sets of 500 members from different providers that were found by simply searching Google for “buy facebook group members.”","People all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","One company charged $25 to add 500 members that were located in the US or UK. Another charged just $6 for 500 members that were not accounts specifically based in those two countries. In each case the process was the same: After the order was placed BuzzFeed News was contacted by email or Facebook and told to make a specific Facebook profile an administrator of the group. Once done, the administrator began quickly adding other Facebook accounts to the group. Suddenly these newly created groups appeared more popular than they were, and were likely to show up higher in search results on Facebook.","The profiles added to the groups appeared to belong to real people, though a sampling of some of them found they were inactive for a year or two. The orders that did not specify US and UK profiles saw accounts added primarily from Bangladesh and India.","A man in Pakistan who helped fulfil one of the orders told BuzzFeed News in a Facebook Messenger chat that he could easily add large numbers of profiles to any group in a short amount of time.","“I do even 500,000 members in single group easily,” he said.","He said the accounts he adds to a group belong to real people. The key is that he controls many Facebook accounts that he uses to friend real people. Once two accounts are friends, Facebook easily allows one profile to add the other into a public group without requiring their permission. (In the case of closed and secret groups, the invited profile must accept the request.)","The result is that people all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","The man told BuzzFeed News he uses a computer programming script to automatically add members in batches of 500 to 700. If he does more than that at a time he risks being banned by Facebook. But that limit appears to do little to deter those selling group members. (Once he saw that the BuzzFeed News reporter had a verified Facebook profile he offered to pay to get profiles he controls verified.)","Facebook","Facebook groups themselves are also places to purchase black-hat online marketing services. BuzzFeed News joined a group dedicated to Google’s AdSense advertising network and saw a post from an admin that listed his services. One item for sale? Facebook groups.","“I have facebook trade and sell groups for sale 20k to 40k members,” he wrote.","Radicalization by the recommendation engine","DiResta, the security researcher, first saw the risks of groups in 2015 while researching health conspiracy content and communities on social networks. She joined anti-vaccine parenting groups on Facebook and watched as well-meaning parents became increasingly radicalized in their views of Western medicine. She also saw false and misleading links spread quickly within groups.","DiResta also documented how group members coordinated the sharing of specific links on Twitter and other platforms to create the impression of an outpouring of support for a specific point of view. “They didn’t have bots but they were effectively replicating the function of bots,” DiResta said. “They were using these groups to coordinate and spread these messages.”","Facebook’s recommendation system also began its own process of algorithmic radicalization. DiResta noticed that as her account became more involved in anti-vax groups Facebook shifted the kind of groups it recommended to her. She was soon being shown groups about chemtrails, fluoride conspiracies, and flat Earth. As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, Facebook suggested she join groups dedicated to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. DiResta calls it “radicalization via the recommendation engine.”","She provided two screenshots to BuzzFeed News, both taken in December 2016, that show Pizzagate group recommendations for her profile. The largest group being pitched had more than 12,000 members at the time.","Similarly, after BuzzFeed News joined the group dedicated to gaming and cheating AdSense, Facebook’s recommendation engine surfaced a list of groups dedicated to the same topics, as if to say, “We see you enjoy ad and click fraud. Try these groups to learn more.”","Facebook also uses data about groups membership to recommend new friends. At the same time that the groups recommendation engine can push people further to the fringe, Facebook will suggest new friends who reinforce these perspectives.","Another concern for DiResta is how secret groups are used to further the radicalization process. When she was researching the anti-vax community she found it was easy to join open and closed groups. But she soon discovered that people used secret groups to exchange the most sensitive information and even engage in illegal activity.","“People would go into a group and say, ‘Hey, I need to get a medical exemption [for vaccines] for my kid’ and someone would say, ‘Hang on, I’ll DM you.’ Then gradually they recruit you into a secret group,” she said. “There was a whole underground network of information sharing around which doctors to go to in order to get fraudulent medical exemptions.”","DiResta said Facebook must find a way to strike a balance between letting people search for and talk about the topics they want without actively radicalizing or polarizing them.","“People have a right to search for Pizzagate and join Pizzagate groups, yes,” she said. “But for Facebook to be continuously, proactively surfacing these types of groups to people, that I think is where the ethics of the recommender system is insufficiently developed right now.”","“At a minimum, it needs to be studying how often people respond to these suggestions, and how groups may be impacting polarization,” she said. “Only Facebook has this data.”","Tellingly, even those who are happily engaging in conspiracy theory groups on Facebook also express frustration with how the product is being exploited. Last month a member of the PizzagateUncompromised group (7,500 members) posted a warning.","Facebook","“The groups Exposing the Rothschilds and Pizzagate Exposed were hijacked,” he wrote.","It happened the same way that “Republicans Suck” and “Mystic Fire Native Heart” were taken over.","“It happens in a lot of groups,” replied one person. “Time to look for some good alternatives to FB imo.” ●","Craig Silverman is a media editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in Toronto."],"isopubdate":""}

{"originalurl":"https://russia-insider.com/en/facebook-not-russia-helped-trump-win-2016-election-cambridge-analytica/ri22874","title":"Facebook, Not Russia, Helped Trump Win the 2016 Election (Cambridge Analytica)","text":["This story is seriously a year old, and although I was not the first journalist to write about this, I did bring it to the attention of about 6,300+ readers. While it is new that we have a whistleblower, and the number “50 million accounts”, what the media isn’t telling you is how Cambridge Analytica actually pulled this off.","The fact of the matter is the data that Cambridge Analytica acquired from Facebook, much of which they obtained legally and as Facebook intended them to, was entirely useless without machine learning. Machine learning is one of the baby steps required for building artificial intelligence, it is a field of computer science that gives computer systems the ability to “learn” with data without being programmed by a person. It was this technology that Cambridge Analytica used to analyze tens of millions of users profiles using data they acquired from Facebook, and put together psychological profiles of users. They then used Facebook’s targeted advertising system to display ads and content at those users geared towards their own psychological profile. Think of it as persuasive arguing on steroids hyper targeted by your own beliefs about the world.","For example, I let Cambridge Analytica analyze my data and they pegged me as a liberal. I know this may be a shocking revelation to all of my haters who believe I’m a conservative Russian agent conspiracy theorist who sells tinfoil hats for a living, but according to my Facebook data I’m a liberal. They also determined I’m more intelligent than 96% of Facebook users, and I somehow lost inteligence points because I like the Beatles (mostly a John Lennon fan), but that is a subject for an entirely different article.","What this means is Cambridge Analytica knows I am probably not going to vote for Trump based on my psychological profile. However, that is actually more valuable to them than not. There is little point to spending advertising dollars on people who you know will vote for your candidate, the person you want to target is actually the person who will not vote for your candidate and instead convince them to not vote. This is what I believe Cambridge Analytica did, I believe they targeted liberals in swing states and promoted anti-Hillary content in an attempt to convince people not to vote. It means they had to target fewer people, spend less money, and ultimately accomplish their goal of winning the election.","All Cambridge Analytica had to do was figure out who was a liberal, and convince them not to show up on election day. By doing so they could ignore everyone who couldn’t vote for whatever reason, and only spend a small portion of their budget on making sure Trump supporters showed up to vote. A no-vote was actually more powerful in swing states, where guess what? Liberal voter turnout was lower for Hillary than it was for Obama. Granted, I still think Hillary blew it and didn’t campaign properly. I am not excusing her ineptitude, she was a horrible candidate and I did not vote for her (Yes, I voted for the female doctor instead, and no I don’t regret it, lets just not talk about it, okay?).","Perhaps this is a just a giant coincidence, but I don’t think it is. Given Donald Trump’s ad spend, I’m fairly certain this is exactly what happened. The reason I believe this is because if I were hired to help win an election and had the tools and data Cambridge Analytica had, it is exactly what I would do. I don’t have anything to prove my theory unfortunately, but given what is being reported I am fairly certain I am on to something, and first came up with this theory a year ago before the media went into freak out mode.","This is why psychological profiling, privacy, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is so frightening when put in the wrong hands. It isn’t the machines we need to fear, it is the people who are in control of those machines and our data that we need to worry about. Machines are just tools, but people are fickle and with the right incentive easily corrupted.","Facebook, Not Russia, Helped Trump Win The Election","We know from Wikileaks that John Podesta was in touch with Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, and even thanked her for helping them “elect the first woman President of the United States.” However, Hillary didn’t win despite the fact Facebook was trying to get her elected alongside Google who was censoring search results, possibly running their own bots, and Twitter who was censoring the truth and purposely hiding Wikileaks tweets which are 100% factual (as they later admitted to congress).","The reason Hillary Clinton did not win despite the media and social media companies doing everything they could to rig the election in her favor is because Facebook double dipped and allowed Cambridge Analytica to use their surveying tools to collect user data on tens of millions of users. This data was then used to target tens of millions of users with political advertising using Facebook’s ad platform based on psycholgoical profiles from data they bought or acquired from Facebook.","Facebook is basically responsible for feeding the analytics system that enabled Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign to be so targeted and effective with a minimal budget. They ultimately won Donald Trump the swing states and the election. As well as subverted democracy, and likely made Facebook a bunch of money.","That’s what happened, that’s how Trump won. It wasn’t the Russians, it was our own social media companies who sold our data to the Trump campaign which they then likely used to convince liberals not to vote in swing states. It’s both horrifying, and cleverly brilliant at the same time."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Have you talked about being a stay-at-home mom, the single parent of a toddler, or a disabled veteran? Have you ever “liked” Telemundo or written about learning English as a second language?","If any of the above are true, advertisers on Facebook may have been able to target you — or exclude you — from seeing housing ads, a new lawsuit alleges.","In the lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in New York, several fair housing groups accuse Facebook of allowing landlords and real estate companies to illegally tailor their advertisement audiences on the basis of sex, family status, number of children and other factors. This practice, the housing groups allege, amounts to discrimination.","The lawsuit comes amid an ongoing controversy over the data privacy practices of the world’s largest social network, which is frequented by more than 2 billion people every month.","Facebook is facing allegations that British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly used the details of tens of millions of Facebook users to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. Regulators and attorneys general across the country are probing Facebook’s role in the data collection, and the Federal Trade Commission announced Monday it was investigating the company.","“Amid growing public concern in the past weeks that Facebook has mishandled users’ data, our investigation shows that Facebook also allows and even encourages its paid advertisers to discriminate using its vast trove of personal data,” Lisa Rice, the National Fair Housing Alliances’ president and CEO, said in a statement.","“It is already a challenge for women, families with children, people with disabilities and other underserved groups to find housing,” Rice added. “Facebook’s platform that excludes these consumers from ever seeing certain ads to rent or buy housing must be changed immediately. Facebook ought to be opening doors to housing opportunities instead of closing them.”","Facebook has repeatedly vowed in recent years to stop letting marketers run housing ads that target or exclude users by race, ethnic identity, gender and other characteristics. But Tuesday’s lawsuit alleges that Facebook has continued to let advertisers discriminate, despite calls from advocacy groups since 2016 to stop such practices.","Facebook on Tuesday denied the lawsuit’s allegations. “There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook,” a spokesman said in a statement to multiplenews outlets. “We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”","The four fair housing groups that filed the lawsuit, the National Fair Housing Alliance and three of its member organizations, investigated Facebook’s practices in housing markets in the Washington, New York, Miami, and San Antonio metropolitan areas. They created fake realty firms and submitted dozens of housing ads to Facebook for review.","According to the lawsuit, Facebook provided the fake Realtors with pre-populated lists of groups they could choose to exclude from seeing the ads, including women or men or families with children. They could also opt to exclude people with certain interests, including disabled veterans, disabled parking permits, or learning English as a second language.","In January, for example, the National Fair Housing Alliance says it made an ad for a fake apartment, using Facebook to promote it to people in Washington. Choosing from a list of preset options, the fictitious landlord was able to exclude people with interests in the “National Association for Bikers with a Disability,” “Disabled American Veterans,” “Disability.gov,” and “Disabled Parking Permit.” Facebook estimated the ad would reach 1.2 million people, the group reported.","The company gathers this data through information self-reported on Facebook accounts, and by tracking users’ activity on Facebook and across the Internet. Such data is a boon for advertisers, and in turn, for Facebook. The company generated almost all of its revenue last year — some $40 billion — through advertising.","The groups behind the lawsuit claim Facebook’s practices violate the federal Fair Housing Act, which prohibits disseminating housing ads that indicate “any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.”","“If women with school-age children are categorically excluded from the Facebook advertising audience for a rental apartment in a community with high-performing schools and other amenities, they are effectively denied access to that housing opportunity,” the lawsuit states. “Facebook and its advertisers have made the ad invisible to them.”","Fred Freiberg, executive director of the New York City-based Fair Housing Justice Center, said in a statement that Facebook’s advertising platform is “the virtual equivalent of posting a for-rent sign that says No Families with Young Kids or No Women, but it does so in an insidious and stealth manner so that people have no clue they have been excluded on the basis of family status or sex.”","The plaintiffs are asking the court to end Facebook’s practice of discriminatory housing advertising and to require the company to change its advertising platform to comply with fair-housing laws. It also requests punitive damages.","This is not the first time advocacy groups have called on Facebook to change its advertising practices. In October 2016, ProPublica revealed how Facebook enabled marketers to exclude groups with what it called “ethnic affinities,” including blacks and Hispanics, from seeing ads.","In response, Facebook announced it would end the use of “ethnic affinity marketing.” It said it would require housing, employment, and credit advertisers to “self-certify” that their ads complied with anti-discrimination laws.","Still, in November of last year, ProPublica was able to buy dozens of rental housing ads that excluded blacks, Jews, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Spanish speaker and mothers of high school kids. Facebook approved all the ads, ProPublica reported.","“Facebook has known for years that its advertising platform violates civil rights laws, but it has refused to change its ways on a voluntary basis,” Diane L. Houk, one of plaintiffs’ attorneys, said in a statement. “Facebook is not above the law and must answer these civil rights claims in court.”","Content from Allstate This content is paid for by an advertiser and published by WP BrandStudio.

Trump. She said the man told her: “Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.”CreditCreditCBS News, via Associated Press","The pornographic film star Stephanie Clifford told “60 Minutes” that she struck a $130,000 deal for her silence about an alleged affair with Donald J. Trump in the final days of the 2016 campaign because she was worried about her safety and that of her young daughter.","That concern, she told “60 Minutes” in an interview broadcast on Sunday night, was based on a threat she received in 2011 from a man who approached her in Las Vegas. She said the threat came after she sold her story about Mr. Trump for $15,000 to Bauer Publishing, which finally published the interview in its magazine InTouch early this year. Bauer had initially decided not to run it after Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue.","“I was in a parking lot going to a fitness class with my infant daughter,” she told the “60 Minutes” correspondent and CNN host Anderson Cooper. “And a guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.’ And he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl, it would be a shame if something happened to her mom.’ ”","Ms. Clifford said she did not go to the police after the threat, but when, years later, a lawyer came to her with an offer brokered by Mr. Cohen in the final days of the presidential campaign, she took it because “I was concerned for my family and their safety.”","Ms. Clifford’s interview — which made for the most anticipated episode of “60 Minutes” in recent memory — was something of a national event, one marked by viewing parties and “Dark and Stormy” cocktail specials at bars, a nod to her professional name, Stormy Daniels.","And it was a quintessential moment of the Trump presidency — a tabloid-ready scandal and must-see television — that carried potential legal implications for Mr. Trump and his longtime lawyer and personal fixer, Michael Cohen. Until Sunday’s broadcast, Ms. Clifford had kept her public appearances to the strip club circuit — what she called her “Make America Horny Again” tour. But, in speaking with Mr. Cooper, she chose businesslike attire that was in keeping with the seriousness of the legal case she is making, that she had been silenced in a cover-up effort to protect the presidential prospects of Mr. Trump.","Ms. Clifford is one of two women who have recently filed suit seeking to get out of agreements they said they entered during the last stretch of the 2016 campaign to give up the rights to their stories about what they have said were affairs with Mr. Trump. The other woman, a former Playmate named Karen McDougal, sold her rights to the company that owns The National Enquirer — which never published it — and spoke to Mr. Cooper on CNN on Thursday. Representatives for Mr. Trump have denied that he had an affair with either woman.","Ms. Clifford’s appearance on “60 Minutes” showed that the effort to keep her story from public view had failed spectacularly — just as statements from Mr. Cohen that he would seek millions of dollars in damages from her for violating a hush agreement had not kept her from appearing on what is often the highest-rated program in television news.","Shortly after “60 Minutes” aired, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, Brent H. Blakely, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Ms. Clifford’s new lawyer, Michael Avenatti. It accused him and Ms. Clifford of defaming Mr. Cohen in relation to the threat she says she received and demanding a public apology.","“Mr. Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,” Mr. Blakely wrote. “You and your client’s false statements about Mr. Cohen accuse him of criminal conduct and constitute, among other things, libel per se and intentional infliction of emotional distress.”","During the interview Mr. Cooper asked Ms. Clifford why she was taking the legally risky route of sitting for a nationally televised interview. “I was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I’m not O.K. with being made out to be a liar,” she said.","Ms. Clifford had first threatened to speak out in February, after, she said, Mr. Cohen broke his part of the previously secret 2016 agreement by telling The New York Times that he had paid the $130,000 from his own pocket. He has denied Mr. Trump had an affair with Ms. Clifford.","Video","Here’s a guide to understanding the White House scandal after Michael Cohen’s admission that President Trump directed him to give the porn star Stormy Daniels hush money.Published OnMarch 9, 2018","The White House was quiet ahead of the airing of Ms. Clifford’s interview, though an ally of Mr. Trump’s, the Newsmax founder and editor in chief, Christopher Ruddy, told ABC News earlier on Sunday that Mr. Trump considered her story “a political hoax.” Mr. Trump spent the evening before the interview dining at his club in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, with Mr. Cohen.","Ms. Clifford said during the interview that while she had seen Mr. Trump more than once, she had had sex with him a single time, unprotected. That happened shortly after they met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in 2006. (Ms. McDougal has also said that she, too, was intimate with Mr. Trump during that event.) Mr. Trump was 60 at the time; Ms. Clifford was 27.","Ms. Clifford said that Mr. Trump had invited her to his hotel suite for dinner, and that their banter began with him showing her a magazine cover featuring his photograph. “I was like, ‘Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it,”’ she said. “So he turned around and pulled his pants down a little — you know, had underwear on and stuff, and I just gave him a couple swats.”","It was done in a joking manner, she said, and the flirtation — which included Mr. Trump comparing Ms. Clifford to his daughter — led to intercourse, though, she said, she had not been particularly attracted to Mr. Trump and had not wanted to have sex with him. (She said she nonetheless went along of her own accord.)","“He said that it was great,” she said, and told her he had had “a great evening, and it was nothing like he expected, that I really surprised him, that a lot of people must underestimate me — that he hoped that I would be willing to see him again, and that we would discuss the things we had talked about earlier in the evening.”","Mr. Trump, she said, had raised the possibility that he get her onto his reality show, “Celebrity Apprentice,” but it would not come to be.","She said that he had invited her to his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow in 2007 to fill her in on that promise. The entertainment for the night, she said, was a “Shark Week” documentary. Mr. Trump, she said, wanted to have sex but this time she did not go along with it, and when he did not have an answer for her about being on the show, she left. She said he told her over the phone a month later that he would not be able to get her onto the program and that was effectively the end of it.","But when her story threatened to surface again in 2016, Ms. Clifford said, her lawyer, Keith Davidson, called her. “I think I have the best deal for you,” she said Mr. Davidson told her, presenting Mr. Cohen’s offer. (Mr. Davidson had also represented Ms. McDougal.)","When Mr. Cooper said some viewers would be skeptical that Ms. Clifford had made her decision because of a threat made years earlier, she said she “didn’t even negotiate” and “just quickly said ‘yes,’ to this very, you know, strict contract, and what most people will agree with me, extremely low number.” Ms. Clifford also said that she had “turned down a large payday multiple times.”","Ms. Clifford said that she can remember the man’s face to this day and would recognize him immediately. Mr. Avenatti said earlier this month that she had been threatened, although he did not provide any details. At the time, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “Obviously we take the safety and security of any person seriously, certainly would condemn anyone threatening any individual.”","When the story about the payoff first broke earlier this year, Ms. Clifford had signed a statement emphatically denying that an affair had taken place. She told Mr. Cooper that she had been told that if she failed to sign it, “they can make your life hell in many different ways.” That sentiment, she indicated, was based on the terms of the agreement, not on any new threat of physical violence, though, she said, she felt both “intimidated” and “bullied.”","Lawyers for Mr. Cohen have said that Ms. Clifford faces $20 million in penalties for violating an agreement to remain quiet and that the agreement was still binding.","Mr. Cohen has denied any involvement by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. But Mr. Avenatti, through his various media appearances, has been trying to build a case that Mr. Cohen was acting in his capacity as a lawyer at the Trump Organization when he worked on the agreement. He presented new evidence on “60 Minutes”: a FedEx envelope showing that Mr. Davidson had sent the contract to Mr. Cohen at his office at the Trump Organization, and addressed a cover letter to him in his official Trump Organization capacity.","Mr. Cooper pressed Ms. Clifford on whether she was not coming forward to cash in on her affair now that Mr. Trump had become president. She did not apologize for the extra money she says she is already making as a dancer because of the surrounding publicity, but noted that she was also opening herself up to real financial risk.","Asked what she would tell the president if he was watching, she said, “He knows I’m telling the truth.”","Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Adult Film Star Feared for Safety Of Daughter After Trump Threat.

The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","The recovery in Facebook's stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company's relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company's privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc <GOOGL.O> and Twitter Inc <TWTR.N> to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook's failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,\" said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is \"absolutely certain\" that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I'm going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

They define themselves by their intelligence and they don't like the idea that a machine could be way smarter than them, so they discount the idea — which is fundamentally flawed.\"","Based on his knowledge of machine intelligence and its developments, Musk believes there is reason to be worried.","\"I am really quite close, I am very close, to the cutting edge in AI and it scares the hell out of me,\" said Musk. \"It's capable of vastly more than almost anyone knows and the rate of improvement is exponential.\"","Musk pointed to machine intelligence playing the ancient Chinese strategy game Go to demonstrate rapid growth in AI's capabilities. For example, London-based company, DeepMind, which was acquired by Google in 2014, developed an artificial intelligence system, AlphaGo Zero, that learned to play Go without any human intervention. It learned simply from randomized play against itself. The Alphabet-owned company announced this development in a paper published in October.","Musk worries AI's development will outpace our ability to manage it in a safe way.","\"So the rate of improvement is really dramatic. We have to figure out some way to ensure that the advent of digital super intelligence is one which is symbiotic with humanity. I think that is the single biggest existential crisis that we face and the most pressing one.\"","To do this, Musk recommended the development of artificial intelligence be regulated.","\"I am not normally an advocate of regulation and oversight — I think one should generally err on the side of minimizing those things — but this is a case where you have a very serious danger to the public,\" said Musk.","\"It needs to be a public body that has insight and then oversight to confirm that everyone is developing AI safely. This is extremely important. I think the danger of AI is much greater than the danger of nuclear warheads by a lot and nobody would suggest that we allow anyone to build nuclear warheads if they want. That would be insane,\" he said at SXSW.","\"And mark my words, AI is far more dangerous than nukes. Far. So why do we have no regulatory oversight? This is insane.\"","In his analysis of the dangers of AI, Musk differentiates between case-specific applications of machine intelligence like self-driving cars and general machine intelligence, which he has described previously as having \"an open-ended utility function\" and having a \"million times more compute power\" than case-specific AI.","\"I am not really all that worried about the short term stuff. Narrow AI is not a species-level risk. It will result in dislocation, in lost jobs,and better weaponry and that kind of thing, but it is not a fundamental species level risk, whereas digital super intelligence is,\" explained Musk.","\"So it is really all about laying the groundwork to make sure that if humanity collectively decides that creating digital super intelligence is the right move, then we should do so very very carefully — very very carefully. This is the most important thing that we could possibly do.\"","Musk hopes \"that we are able to achieve a symbiosis\" with artificial intelligence: \"We do want a close coupling between collective human intelligence and digital intelligence, and Neuralink is trying to help in that regard by trying creating a high bandwidth interface between AI and the human brain,\" he said."],"isopubdate":"2018-06-20"}

This information comes from five sources who claim to have discussed the situation with President Trump, “He’s obsessed with Amazon,” a source said. “Obsessed.”","President Trump is reportedly considering altering Amazon’s tax treatment as he is worried that the e-commerce giant may put small, privately owned “mom-and-pop” stores out of business. One source stated: “He’s wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.” The President reportedly focuses on Amazon when discussing tax policy and antitrust cases but has yet to develop a full plan to crack down on the company.","President Trump reportedly has issues with Amazon’s impact on smaller businesses and with what he believes to be the abuse of the U.S. postal system who deliver Amazon’s packages for an extremely low fee. The President previously stated in a tweet “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” A source stated “The whole post office thing, that’s very much a perception he has. It’s been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.”","Axios’ Kim Hart commented on the President’s focus on Amazon saying: “Trump told Axios last year he doesn’t mind Facebook because it helps him reach his audience. He’s an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores. It reminds me of the story Jim wrote a while back about Trump’s fixation with 1950s life. Amazon takes direct aim at some of the core components of mid-century business.”","However, Vice President Pence is reportedly quite interested in the possible regulation or breaking up of large tech companies such as Google or Facebook. The Vice President is reportedly worried about the social media companies influence on the media and their monopoly of the advertising industry and control of user data.","Taking into consideration the fact that Trump’s engagement on Facebook dropped by 45 percent following the site’s News Feed algorithm change earlier this year, perhaps he will come around on the subject as well.","Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

This data reportedly included information siphoned from hundreds of thousands of Amazon Mechanical Turkers who were paid to use a \"personality prediction app\" that collected data from them and also anyone they were friends with -- about 50 million accounts. That data reportedly turned into information used by the likes of Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and the Donald Trump campaign for social media messaging and \"micro-targeting\" individuals based on shared characteristics.","Now, reports by The New York Times and The Guardian reveal what was behind the timing of that Friday night news dump. According to reporters from both outlets, which were collaborating, the social network had downplayed their reporting and even threatened to sue The Guardian, over what they learned from documents and a whistleblower (who Facebook included in its ban list): Christopher Wylie.","Wylie's account largely fills in the gaps from Facebook's statement. While Facebook didn't explain how many users had their data snagged by the \"thisisyourdigitallife\" app, the reports say it pulled private info from more than 50 million people even though they didn't know about it or consent -- an act that at the time was allowed under Facebook's rules. About 30 million of those (a number previously reported by The Intercept) contained enough information for Cambridge Analytica to match profiles with other data and complete its \"psychographic\" work -- learning about individuals and trying to target them with personally tailored messages.","That's the bit that causes Wylie to describe his former employer as engaging in something more like psychological warfare than simple \"data analysis.\" Cambridge Analytica maintains that \"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR.\" It also claims none of the data was used during the 2016 campaign, however, the NYT notes that its CEO previously said the Trump efforts drew on psychographics it had created for the Ted Cruz campaign.","As for Facebook, that company is staunchly pushing the line that this does not represent a \"breach\" or a \"leak\". Deputy General Counsel tweeted that \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\" In a series of now-deleted tweets, CSO Alex Stamos said the app's creator \"lied\" to users and Facebook about what he was using the data for, but said his use was consistent with its API at the time, and the way some APIs for contact sharing works on platforms like Android and iOS. Facebook updated last night's release with a new statement:","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","That will not be enough to avoid further scrutiny however -- according to The Guardian, the British Information Commissioner's Office and the Electoral Commission are investigating. In the US, Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey announced her office is opening an investigation, and they probably won't be the only ones.","That's above and beyond the professor suing Cambridge Analytica in the UK to find out the full extent of the data it has acquired.

The broad indictment, the unfair generalizations, were caricature and calumny, the product of the fevered imagination of the left. Then along came Donald J. Trump, who seemed to embody every awful charge made against the Republican Party.","Later this week he will become my party's nominee.","For many of us lifelong Republicans, the convention in Cleveland will be a time of serious self-reflection, a difficult and honest reckoning. Those of us who have chosen not to attend the convention will have a bit more time on our hands to think it over. How on earth did our party produce Mr. Trump as its nominee?","There's a powerful temptation for many Republicans to avoid that question -- or, in wrestling with it, to look to reassuring explanations and extenuating circumstances. For example, Mr. Trump benefited from an unusually large field of candidates by consolidating support among a small but significant number of Republican primary voters while the rest split their support among the fractured field. Or: Mr. Trump profited from a huge imbalance in free media, earning close to $2 billion worth of it during the presidential campaign, eclipsing, according to one analysis, the total value of media attention given to all other Republican candidates combined.","There are other explanations as well, and they may all have merit. But there is still the unalterable fact that Mr. Trump led for virtually the entire contest and defined its terms from the outset. At every stage -- with every racist statement and nativist appeal, every cruel insult, every new conspiracy theory and fresh revelation of his vast ignorance — he grew stronger rather than weaker. The ceiling we kept hearing about last summer and fall, starting at the high teens and low 20s, kept rising. The candidates who were supposed to vanquish him — many of them talented and accomplished individuals — kept dropping out.","Mr. Trump's comeuppance never came.","He ended up winning 36 contests and more Republican primary votes than anyone in history. That means people like me — in my particular case, someone who all told served a decade in the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations and in the George W. Bush White House — are not only alienated from our political home and isolated in our party; we are in open revolt against its nominee. That says something about Mr. Trump, but it also tells us something about the party he now leads.","For many on the left, explaining what happened is simple: The Republican Party has always been this way, and Mr. Trump is the logical and inevitable culmination of what the Republican Party has represented for decades. He is the ugly face of an ugly party.","I believe the truth is a good deal more complicated. For one thing, the rise of Mr. Trump doesn't invalidate my own experiences of life in a party comprising mostly honorable individuals working to advance an agenda they believed was in the national interest. I understand this will elicit a roll of the eyes in an age when cynicism is fashionable, but it happens to be true. Both parties are made up of imperfect people who have very different worldviews yet who by and large are acting in what they believe is the public interest. The idea that one side comprises Children of Light and the other Children of Darkness is a silly, partisan distortion.","Nor can you take presidents like Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush and nominees like Bob Dole, John McCain and Mitt Romney and say that the common denominator, the core of their appeal, was racism, nativism and misogyny.","But it is fair to say that there existed in the Republican Party repulsive elements, people who were attracted to racial and ethnic politics and moved by resentment and intolerance rather than a vision of the good. This group was larger than I ever imagined, and at important moments the Republican Party either overlooked them or played to them. Some may have been hoping to appeal to these elements while also containing and moderating them, to sand off the rough edges, to keep them within the coalition but not allow them to become dominant. But the opposite happened. The party guests took over the party.","A kind of perfect storm occurred: the financial crisis of 2008 combined with long-term economic stagnation, significant demographic and cultural changes, utter contempt for the political class and outrage that Republicans were not nullifying President Obama or promoting an agenda connected to their concerns. A friend of mine pointed out to me that part of the problem is that we are drenched in distaste for the actual practice of politics, and there's an unstated sense among conservative activists in particular that the activity of governing is somehow illegitimate.","Instead of arguing for the dignity and necessity of politics -- instead of making the case for why the give and take, the debate and compromise, are both necessary and appropriate -- activists and their counterparts in government disparaged it. This helps explain how Mr. Trump seized on deeply anti-political feelings and used them to his advantage, why Republicans so devalued any focus on policy this election season, and why the former reality television star was rewarded for his vast ignorance on issues. That can work only with people who disdain the government and the activity of governing.","All of this was the kindling, and then came the match.","Many of us were aware of the anger and grievances of Republican primary voters, many of which were understandable and some of which were justified. But we did not imagine that these voters, knowing full well the ugly things Mr. Trump represents, would hand him the keys. They did, and now the Republican Party, with its leading figures lining up behind Mr. Trump, cannot escape from him. That is a haunting reality for those of us who have given some part of our lives to a party we believed was flawed but also a force for good and a force for justice.","So what now? The inclination for some is to walk away, to give up on the party. That's not the path I'm taking, at least not yet. For while the struggle for the nomination is over, the struggle for the soul of the party is not. This is a difficult moment for the Republican Party, but not necessarily a lasting one.","There are plenty of Republicans who either oppose Mr. Trump or are queasy about supporting him. He did not win a majority of the total votes cast in the primary. And while Trumpism is on the ascendancy right now, my expectation is that it will soon be politically and morally discredited, including in the eyes of most Republicans.","If not, and certainly if Mr. Trump wins the presidency, the Republican Party will fully enter its dark age. (Set aside for now the damage he would do to the country.) But if he loses, there will be a pitched battle to rebuild the Republican Party; to make it different and better, more hopeful, humane and in touch with the concerns of both working- and middle-class voters, than it was pre-Trump.","The party many of us will fight for is a conservative one that appeals to rather than alienates nonwhites, that doesn't view decency as a sign of weakness or confuse bullying and bluster with strength, and that aims to channel aspirations rather than stoke resentments and organize hatreds.","That vision of the Republican Party will not be on display this week in Cleveland. The nominee of the party makes that impossible. So Republicans will need to look elsewhere for inspiration. In his marvelous biography of Abraham Lincoln, originally published in 1916, Lord Charnwood said of him:","This most unrelenting enemy to the project of the Confederacy was the one man who had quite purged his heart and mind from hatred or even anger towards his fellow-countrymen of the South.","Lord Charnwood added:","For perhaps not many conquerors, and certainly few successful statesmen, have escaped the tendency of power to harden or at least to narrow their human sympathies; but in this man a natural wealth of tender compassion became richer and more tender while in the stress of deadly conflict he developed an astounding strength.","In every important respect, Donald Trump is a repudiation of Lincoln. Win or lose, on the morning after Election Day, Republicans will have to choose whose vision of the party they want to follow.","Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, served in the last three Republican administrations.

The home devices were apparently planned to debut at Facebook’s developer conference in May, well ahead of their scheduled fall release date.","News of the decision to delay closely follows the breaking of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which it was found that that company gathered and stored the personal data of some 50 million Facebook users without their consent. It also comes on the heels of the revelation that the Android Facebook app has been quietly scooping up call and text metadata for years.","According to Bloomberg, focus groups were already leery about Facebook-branded smart home gadgets because of the company’s propensity to horde personal data. Given that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be testifying before Congress on his company’s mishandling of that private user data, delaying the announcement of such devices seems like a sensible move.","The devices sound like they’ll resemble Amazon’s Echo Show and Spot, with a voice assistant and video chat features.

He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica.

That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen.

Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign.

It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers.

Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

If we tend to click on articles on the Times about technology it will show more of those articles to us. If we don't seem to like right wing friends on Facebook, it won't show us those friends activities. It does this automatically and without our permission. It's not at fault or morally wrong for doing this, but the affect of all this is to allow people to live lives more comfortably not been showing others points of view, or more varied fodder to fertilize our brains and ideas. In a world with pretty much unlimited content, in order to maintain a fairly manageable diet, we will soon be shown only things that are clearly at the very center of what it thinks we find interesting, and since we'll be shown nothing outside of this to broaden the funnel, we may have to try hard to see others viewpoints or to expand our brains.","- It tends to show us crap, when we need substance.These same clever algorithums notice the thinks we click on most quickly. Most people in life have things they think they ought to see ( long form articles about Palestine, obscure documentaries about overfishing) and content they tend to have quick urges to snack on, but that have no meaningful content. As people we know we need a healthy balance of both, but the issue with reccomendation engines is they notice only what we appear to have urges for, and not what we want to watch, but never feel like. I'm sure the long term affect of this is that way more involving, interesting, fertile content will be replaced by a never ending stream of bitesized links to Miley Cyrus dancing, \"Things people in LA say\" and other such crap.","- It removes the chances of interesting things.People are inherently curious and adventurous. One of the best things about the internet is that it's opened our minds to doing things we may never have thought about.

And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds.","Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window.","Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach","Read more","But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments.","When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality.","The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default.","“The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said.","“Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.”","To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.","The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well.","The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable.","Aleksandr Kogan","To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters.","It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use.","And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred.","It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another.","The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database.","Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed.","Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”.","Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach.","It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The social network acknowledged on Sunday, March 25, 2018, that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 - first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)","How Facebook was able to siphon off phone call and text logs","How Facebook was able to siphon off phone call and text logs","By RYAN NAKASHIMA and MAE ANDERSON","Mar. 27, 2018","https://apnews.com/3bb6a06ca1f343b2be3a446f014da873","Link copied!","The news that Facebook's Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant. But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place?","The short answer: Because Google let it. The longer answer: Well, it's complicated.","The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 — first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn't collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings.","Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics. The kerfuffle over this data collection, first reported by the website Ars Technica , follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence elections.","There's a reason Facebook's actions were restricted to Android phones. Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. \"Apple's fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,\" said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.","But Android has long been more indulgent.","Until recently, in fact, Google let app developers gain access to a phone's call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.","Starting in 2012 with its \"Jelly Bean\" release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs, but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn't work.","It wasn't until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed \"Marshmallow,\" that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.","That's the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren't using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can't get it even if they want it.","Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.","There are nearly 20,000 Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.","As of January, about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as \"Oreo.\" (Many of them are owners of Google's new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)","Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.","All that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?","Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google's advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.","Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple's App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did.","Experts say it's not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it's very possible.","\"In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. \"There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.\"","It is unclear how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users' call logs had been sent to app developers. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.","One major Android phone maker expressed uncertainty over its role in protecting user privacy. \"At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,\" LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.","___","AP Technology Writer Youkyung Lee in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report."],"isopubdate":""}

Facebook was the latest player to announce its plans for entering the market, but in light of recent scandalous revelations about the company's handling of user data, these plans have been postponed.","While the hardware wasn't expected to hit the market until this fall, Facebook's was planning to show off its smart speaker at the company's big May developer conference. However, according to Bloomberg sources familiar with the matter, plans for the reveal have been postponed indefinitely. This is not to say that Facebook's smart speakers won't see the light of day. In fact, the hardware and software are now \"undergoing a deeper review to ensure that they make the right trade-offs regarding user data,\" Bloomberg's sources said.","Aside from the supposed revisions of the speakers, unveiling a smart connected device in the fallout of the recent data scandal would be a detrimental move for Facebook. Smart speakers are devices that use an array of different sensors, including cameras and microphones, to keep track, listen to, and see their owners. Asking users to trust the company with even more personal data, after it was revealed that 50 million Facebook users had personal information used without their permission to create psychological profiles for the 2016 US presidential election, wouldn't do the company any good.","According to Bloomberg, Facebook has recently done focus-group testing that reflected users' concerns about placing a Facebook-branded device in their living rooms. Still, the company reportedly is on track launch the devices before the end of 2018, after the needed revisions have passed.","So, tell us, would you ever by a Facebook-branded smart speaker after what came to light recently?","5 Comments","Display mode:","Always view all comments","Even if this whole thing didn't happen, i still wouldn't buy a smart speaker by Facebook.

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work — including a former Cambridge Analytica employee — said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what “like” buttons they had hit.","“In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,” the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook’s concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump’s digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user- ­experience researcher, according to Facebook’s public website.","Some critics said Facebook’s actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump’s campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Cambridge Analytica — which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president’s former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon — has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its “psychometric profiles” could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company’s actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain’s information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data “may have been illegally acquired and used.”","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. “It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 E.U. referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee that is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.E.U., a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook’s processes for dealing with developers who broke the company’s rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules — usually because of a story in the news — the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook “relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,” Parakilas said. “During my 16 months at the company, I don’t recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.”","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","“Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,” said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook’s actions on Saturday, including if it ran afoul of its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of its agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry into U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge’s “psychographic targeting” techniques — including its use of Facebook data — with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of Cambridge’s work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers’ likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge’s work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm’s data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign’s data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump’s strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge’s parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in “soft power,” or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO’s Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia’s influence in the region.","SCL’s main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience’s values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of “persuadables,” and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL’s defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company’s techniques is that it “can be undertaken covertly.”","“Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government’s role and/or third parties can be invisible,” he wrote.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

In 2015, Facebook said Cambridge Analytica certified that it had destroyed the information.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica and parent Strategic Communication Laboratories have been suspended from the social network, \"pending further information,\" Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica said in a Saturday statement it did nothing illegal and is ​in touch with Facebook in order to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.","Originally funded by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, Cambridge uses data to reach voters with hyper-targeted messaging, including on Facebook and other online services.

(Joel Kowsky/BLOOMBERG)","From the moment Barack Obama took the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2009, and every day thereafter, his team was always preparing for the 2012 campaign. Everyone said Obama’s 2008 operation had rewritten the book on organizing. But that was just a beginning, a small first step toward what the team envisioned when it began planning the reelection campaign.","In one of their first conversations about 2012, campaign manager Jim Messina said he told the president that they could not rerun 2008. Obama seemed puzzled. “You know we won that one,” Obama said. Messina said too much had changed. For one thing, Obama was now an incumbent with a record. But technology had also leapfrogged forward, with new devices, new platforms and vastly more opportunities to exploit social media. The whole campaign would have to be different.","The president sent the team off to Chicago, far away from the hothouse of Washington and Beltway chatter, to use 2011 to build the foundation and reassemble the army from 2008. As the Republican candidates were gearing up and then battling one another through the summer and fall of 2011, the Obama team was investing enormous amounts of time, money and creative energy in what resembled a high-tech political start-up whose main purpose was to put more people on the streets, armed with more information about the voters they were contacting, than any campaign had ever attempted.","The Obama team had to be better in 2012. The weak economy made the president vulnerable to defeat. His political advisers knew well that turning out the vote would be far more challenging in the reelection effort than it had been in 2008. Many of his early supporters were disappointed and some were outright frustrated with Obama’s performance in office. The advisers recognized that Republicans were trying to block his agenda by questioning whether he had the leadership skills or the tenacity to get done what his first campaign had promised. Obama advisers also knew this campaign would have to be far more negative than the first — with few of the aspirational themes of 2008 — and they began preparing to attack Mitt Romney, the presumed challenger, long before the Republican primaries and caucuses began.","One of the hallmarks of Obama’s 2012 campaign was its prodigious appetite for research. The trio at the top — Messina, senior strategist David Axelrod and White House senior adviser David Plouffe — were enthusiastic consumers of research. Though different in their approaches to politics — Axelrod operated intuitively, Plouffe’s watchwords were “Prove it” and Messina wanted to be able to measure everything — they all pushed the campaign for more research, testing, analysis and innovation.","Message and media operated on one track. The other track focused on identifying, registering, mobilizing and ultimately turning out Obama voters. At the Chicago headquarters, these efforts were guided by Messina and Jen O’Malley Dillon, the deputy campaign manager, along with a sizable team of political organizers and tech-savvy newcomers.","“There’s always been two campaigns since the Internet was invented, the campaign online and the campaign on the doors. What I wanted was, I didn’t care where you organized, what time you organized, how you organized, as long as I could track it, I can measure it, and I can encourage you to do more of it.”","Jim Messina, President Obama’s 2012 campaign manager","The first steps toward building the reelection operation around a single target — maximizing turnout to reach 270 electoral votes — were taken in the months after Obama’s 2008 victory. Campaign staffers compiled a series of after-action reports. “We did a very detailed postmortem where we looked at all kinds of numbers, looking at the general stuff like the number of door knocks we made, phone calls we made, number of voters that we registered,” said Mitch Stewart, who would direct the campaign’s 2012 effort in battleground states. “But then we broke it down by field organizer, we broke it down then by volunteer. We looked at the best way or the best examples in states of what their volunteer organization looked like.”","The project produced a three-ring binder that contained nearly 500 pages and was filled with recommendations on how to strengthen what was already considered a state-of-the-art field operation. Another early step was the decision to massively expand the investment in technology, digital, cable, new media and particularly analytics.","The Obama campaign had the usual contingent of pollsters and ad makers and opposition researchers and, like all campaigns today, a digital director. But it also had a chief technology officer (who had never done politics before), a chief innovation officer and a director of analytics, which would become one of the most important additions and a likely fixture in campaigns of the future. The team hired software engineers and data experts and number-crunchers and digital designers and video producers by the score. They filled the back of a vast room resembling a brokerage house trading floor or tech start-up that occupied the sixth floor of One Prudential Plaza overlooking Millennium Park in Chicago.","No campaign had ever invested so heavily in technology and analytics, and no campaign had ever had such stated ambitions. “Technology was another big lesson learned from 2008, leap of faith and labor of love and angst-ridden entity and all the other things that you can imagine, because we were building things in-house mostly with people that had not done campaign work before,” Dillon later told me. “The deadlines and breaking and testing — is it going to work, what do we do? . . . At the end of the day, it was certainly worth it, because you can’t customize our stuff, and so we just couldn’t buy off the shelf for anything and you know that, and fortunately we had enough time to kind of build the stuff. I don’t know who else will ever have the luxury of doing that again.”","Messina was as data driven as any presidential campaign manager in modern times, and Dillon had concentrated her efforts while at the Democratic National Committee in 2009 and 2010 on the programs that would make Obama’s groundbreaking 2008 campaign look old-fashioned in comparison. They wanted all the data the campaign accumulated about voters to be integrated. The campaign had a voter list and a donor list and volunteer lists and other lists, but what it wanted was the ability to link all the contacts each person had with the operation into one database.","“There’s always been two campaigns since the Internet was invented, the campaign online and the campaign on the doors,” Messina told me. “What I wanted was, I didn’t care where you organized, what time you organized, how you organized, as long as I could track it, I can measure it, and I can encourage you to do more of it.” It took the technology team nearly a year, but it produced software that allowed all of the campaign’s lists to talk to one another. The team named it Narwhal, after a whale of amazing strength that lives in the Arctic but is rarely seen. Harper Reed, the chief technology officer, described it as the software platform for everything else the campaign wanted to do and build.","Obama speaks at a campaign event at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colo., on Aug. 28, 2012. (Nikki Kahn/THE WASHINGTON POST)","The next goal was to create a program that would allow everyone — campaign staffers in Chicago, state directors and their staff in the battlegrounds, field organizers, volunteers going door to door and volunteers at home — to communicate simply and seamlessly. The Obama team wanted something that allowed the field organizers in the Des Moines or Columbus or Fairfax offices to have access to all the campaign’s information about the voters for whom they were responsible. They wanted volunteer leaders to have online access as well. That brought about the creation of Dashboard, which Messina later said was the hardest thing the campaign did but which became the central online organizing vehicle. It was enormously complicated to develop, made all the more difficult because the engineers who were building it had never worked on a campaign and did not instinctively understand the work of field organizers. Some of them were sent out to the states briefly as organizers to better understand the needs of those on the front lines.","“Dashboard is what we needed to communicate,” Dillon said. “It was all about the users, so if the users didn’t have a good experience, there was no point in it. . . . That’s why it was the Holy Grail.”","Reed described it as a way to bring the field office to the Internet. “When you walk into a field office, you have many opportunities,” he said. “We’ll hand you a call sheet. You can make calls. You can knock on doors, and they’ll have these stacks there for you. They’ll say: ‘Harper, you’ve knocked on 50 doors. That’s great. Here’s how you compare to the rest of them.’ But it’s all very offline. It’s all very ad hoc, and it’s not very modern. And so what we set out to do was create that offline field experience online.”","Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager, talks with reporters during a tour of the re-election headquarters in Chicago. (Frank Polich/GETTY IMAGES)","Reed said that near the end of the campaign they received an e-mail from a wounded Afghanistan war veteran who was in a hospital. He was logging into Dashboard and participating in the organizing effort the way any other volunteer walking precincts was doing. Reed was astonished by the message. He said, “I could have quit that day, and I would have been satisfied with my role.”","The Obama leaders not only wanted all the lists to be able to talk to one another, they also wanted people to be able to organize their friends and family members. This was taking a concept introduced in 2004 by George W. Bush’s reelection team — the notion that voters are more likely to listen to people they know than to paid callers or strangers knocking on their door — and updating it to take advantage of new technology, namely the explosion of social media.","Early in 2011, some Obama operatives visited Facebook, where executives were encouraging them to spend some of the campaign’s advertising money with the company. “We started saying, ‘Okay, that’s nice if we just advertise,’ ” Messina said. “But what if we could build a piece of software that tracked all this and allowed you to match your friends on Facebook with our lists, and we said to you, ‘Okay, so-and-so is a friend of yours, we think he’s unregistered, why don’t you go get him to register?’ Or ‘So-and-so is a friend of yours, we think he’s undecided. Why don’t you get him to be decided?’ And we only gave you a discrete number of friends. That turned out to be millions of dollars and a year of our lives. It was incredibly complex to do.”","But this third piece of the puzzle provided the campaign with another treasure trove of information and an organizing tool unlike anything available in the past. It took months and months to solve, but it was a huge breakthrough. If a person signed on to Dashboard through his or her Facebook account, the campaign could, with permission, gain access to that person’s Facebook friends. The Obama team called this “targeted sharing.” It knew from other research that people who pay less attention to politics are more likely to listen to a message from a friend than from someone in the campaign. The team could supply people with information about their friends based on data it had independently gathered. The campaign knew who was and who wasn’t registered to vote. It knew who had a low propensity to vote. It knew who was solid for Obama and who needed more persuasion — and a gentle or not-so-gentle nudge to vote. Instead of asking someone to send a message to all of his or her Facebook friends, the campaign could present a handpicked list of the three or four or five people it believed would most benefit from personal encouragement.","Digital director Teddy Goff told my colleague Aaron Blake, “For people who allowed us, we were able to say to them: ‘All right, you just watched a video about registering to vote. Don’t just share it with all your friends on Facebook. We’ve run a match, and here are your 10 friends on Facebook who we think may not be registered to vote and live in Ohio, Colorado, Virginia, Florida.’ ” This was especially helpful in trying to reach voters under age 30. On Obama’s target lists, the voter file contained no good contact information for half of those young voters — they didn’t have land lines, and no other information was available. But Goff said 85 percent of that group were on Facebook and could be reached by a friend of a friend. Reed described another example. Someone interested in health care might click on an ad on Facebook, and up would pop an infographic about health care. At the end of it would be a “share” button, and if the person clicked on it, names of friends the person could share the information with would appear. The campaign knew from its own database which of those friends were most likely to respond to information about health care. “We went through and we looked at all those friends and found the ones that were the best matches for that specific piece of content,” Reed said.","Google’s Eric Schmidt, who offered advice to the campaign, said: “If you don’t know anything about campaigns you would assume it’s national, but a successful campaign is highly, highly local, down to the Zip code. The revolution in technology is to understand where the undecideds are in this district and how you reach them.” That was what the integration of technology and old-fashioned organizing was designed to do for Obama in 2012.","Dan Wagner had come to the DNC after the 2008 election to expand what was initially a tiny analytics operation. In early 2010, others on the Obama team had an epiphany about the value of analytics. It came just before the special election to fill the Senate seat of the late Edward M. Kennedy in Massachusetts. Many Democrats were still in denial about the direction of the race, incredulous that a little-known Republican state senator named Scott Brown could have enough momentum to defeat Democratic state Attorney General Martha Coakley. Wagner, who was operating with the analytics team out of the DNC, analyzed the numbers and surmised that Brown would win. He delivered his conclusions and the data to Messina. “He said, ‘We’re going to lose, and here’s why we’re going to lose,’ and it happened almost exactly like that,” Messina said. “That’s when we first started saying this modeling can really be something.”","Dillon and national field director Jeremy Bird brought Wagner to the re­election campaign. Eventually the team modeled practically everything — voters, states, volunteers, donors, anything it could think of to improve efficiency — to give it greater confidence in its decision making. It wanted to know who was most likely to serve as a volunteer, and it created a model to find out. The campaign established record numbers of offices in the states, and record numbers of staging areas for volunteers, based in part on analysis of how much more likely people were to volunteer if they were close to an office. “We built a model on volunteer likelihood,” Stewart said. “We built a model on turnout, we built a model on support, we built a model on persuasion — who’s most persuadable.”","From modeling and testing, the campaign refined voter outreach. Virtually every e-mail it sent included a test of some sort — the subject line, the appeal, the message — designed to maximize contributions, volunteer hours and eventually turnout on Election Day. The campaign would break out 18 smaller groups from e-mail lists, create 18 versions of an e-mail, and then watch the response rate for an hour and go with the winner — or take a combination of subject line and message from different e-mails and turn them into the finished product. Big corporations had used such testing for years, but political campaigns had not.","The team’s attention to detail rivaled that of the most successful corporations. One innovation was the recruitment of corporate trainers or coaches, who volunteered to help teach everyone how to manage. “We recruited a whole group of pro bono executive coaches,” Bird said. “These are people that coach Fortune 100 companies.” Obama’s team recruited them as volunteers, but instead of having them knock on doors, they were asked to provide management training. “We had them partner up with our state leadership,” Bird said. “They didn’t need to know anything about campaigns, because we didn’t want their advice on how to run a campaign. We wanted their advice on how to be a manager.”","The campaign also sought advice from what the New York Times later called a “dream team” of academics who described themselves as a “consortium of behavioral scientists.” The group included political scientists, psychologists and behavioral economists. The campaign was operating well outside the traditional network of political consultants.","Throughout 2011, Obama advisers were baffled by the slow start to the Republican presidential race. They knew from their experience in 2008 how long it took to build a field operation capable of winning a campaign. They were even more keenly aware of the lead times and money required to assemble the technological infrastructure to support a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation for 2012. Republicans could see that the Obama campaign was spending tens of millions of dollars in 2011. They just weren’t sure on what.","Approximately 9,000 people gathered in the rain for rally with President Barack Obama at Cleveland State University in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 5, 2012. (Nikki Kahn/THE WASHINGTON POST)","The gap between the Obama and Romney operations crystallized in the key battleground state of Ohio in the closing weeks of the general-election campaign. Members of Obama’s team had been on the ground in Ohio for years. They knew the state intimately. Obama had at least 130 offices there, plus 500 or so staging areas for volunteers. He had almost 700 staffers on the Ohio payroll alone. Thousands of volunteers contacted voters.","Romney had to put together an organization in a matter of months. He had about 40 offices and 157 paid staff members, although most of them were on the Republican National Committee’s payroll. Scott Jennings, Romney’s Ohio state director, said after the election that there was no way the Republicans could conquer Obama’s head start. “Our ground game was as good as it could have possibly been, given the time and resources we had to work with,” he said. “There’s just no substitute for time. Six months . . . wasn’t enough to overcome six years of a constant campaign run by the other side. Truly it is remarkable to see what they did, in the rearview mirror.”","Aaron Pickrell, Obama’s chief Ohio strategist, told a story about himself that illustrated the disparity between the two campaigns’ ground operations. An Obama volunteer knocked on his door during the summer, just to check in and see if he had any questions. The volunteer did not know who Pickrell was. He knew, based on campaign data, only that Pickrell should be a solid Obama voter, someone who needed to be contacted once at most.","Pickrell and his wife later ordered absentee ballots. When the ballots arrived, they set them aside on the kitchen table, where they sat for two weeks. “I got thrown back into the database of people who needed to be contacted,” he said. Soon an Obama volunteer knocked on their door to remind them to turn in the ballots. Once they did, there was no more contact. That was the level of the campaign’s efficiency. Meanwhile, Pickrell said he received a dozen direct-mail pieces from the Romney campaign, a waste of money and effort on the Republicans’ part. He got no direct mail from the Obama campaign because the database said he didn’t need persuading. Rich Beeson, Romney’s political director, eventually learned the scope and sophistication of the Obama operation. “They took that to another level,” he said.","Through modeling, voters were rated on a scale of 1 to 100 on their likelihood to support Obama. A similar scale was used to predict the likelihood that people would turn out. So if someone had a high support score and a low turnout score, meaning that person was very likely to support Obama but not so likely to vote, the campaign tried to make sure that person got registered and then cast a ballot, preferably during the period of early voting. Banking those sporadic voters became a top priority.","The Obama team had done support and turnout estimations in 2008 but more experimentally. This time, the campaign added a third measure, a persuasion score. This helped weed out people who said they were independent but really were not. In the final weeks of the campaign, the team focused on voters with persuasion scores of 40 to 60. Those with higher scores were likely to vote for Obama without much persuasion. The others probably weren’t going to back the president no matter how open they said they were.","“In the old days you would say, ‘Here’s a list of people we think are independents, go to those houses,’ ” Messina said. “But you waste your volunteers’ time all over the place because despite what someone says, there are a very small amount of undecided voters.” By knowing the voters and modeling the electorate, the campaign wasted less time pounding the pavement.","No get-out-the-vote operation works precisely as planned — or as characterized in after-action reports by the winning campaign. It always sounds better than it is. On the streets, it never looks as smooth as described at headquarters.

I guess that's all they have left,\" he said.","Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the \"Wild West.\"","\"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,\" he said.","With Republicans controlling the Senate's majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.","The New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook's demands beginning in 2015.","Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.","Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump's 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.","Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.","Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.","Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. \"We must do better and will,\" he wrote on Twitter, adding that \"our business depends on it at every level.\"","Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.","Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.","Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. \"That's a long time,\" she said.","Britain's data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.","\"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

I’m sure he needs some advice on how to spend it. Here’s mine: He should use it to undo the terrible damage done by Facebook and other forms of social media to democratic debate and civilized discussion all over the world.","Weak democracies are the most vulnerable to the curse of Facebook. I was recently at a gathering of experts who work in post-conflict countries, and all present agreed: Reconstructing a nation — any nation, whether Libya or East Timor — requires the establishment of a framework for national debate. If nothing else, leaders of the conflict have to agree about why the war ended, why they decided to stop fighting and what will happen next. Then they have to transmit that agreement to their followers. But if this is impossible — because “mainstream” media don’t exist, because Facebook offers conflicting versions of the truth, because no one trusts what they read — then peace is impossible, too.","Poor democracies are equally vulnerable. In countries — and there are more than you think — where reputable, fact-checked, independent media don’t function (because they’re too expensive, because the Internet destroyed the advertising market, because illiberal governments put pressure on the media), then the possibility of civilized conversation disappears, too. If different versions of the truth appear in different online versions; if no one can agree upon what actually happened yesterday; if fake, manipulated or mendacious news websites are backed up by mobs of Internet trolls; then conspiracy theories, whether of the far left or far right, will soon have the same weight as reality. Politicians who lie will be backed by a claque of supporters.","Rich democracies haven’t realized that this is also fast becoming their problem. Whenever I’ve described the disappearance of facts and the growth of Internet fantasy while in London or Washington, the response has usually been rather smug: How very terrible for all of those people in Tunisia or Slovakia, but “it couldn’t happen here.” But it can and it has: Donald Trump claimed that “thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey cheered the collapse of the World Trade Center, and thousands of real commenters and bloggers rushed to his defense on Facebook and elsewhere. Never mind that it didn’t happen: It is now possible to live in a virtual reality where Trump’s lies are acclaimed as the hidden truth that the mainstream media have concealed from the masses.","Those who don’t live in Trump’s world can find alternatives, of course. Ali Amin, a Virginia teenager, was so entranced by the world of online jihad that he became “absorbed in a ‘virtual’ struggle while disconnecting from what was real.” He wound up with an 11-year prison sentence for providing material support to a terrorist group. Nor is that kind of experience reserved for jihadis. Anyone who spends any time in the many alternative worlds that can be accessed via Twitter or Facebook can encounter similarly false information, in many forms and in many languages, every day. Just follow the right Twitter accounts, and you’ll get links to the fake websites and dubious organizations that produce invented statistics. You’ll find friends who believe in the invented statistics, too. If you so desire, you can then go on to live in a bubble entirely divorced from any reality except one created by far-right bloggers, left-wing anarchists or Kremlin spin doctors, all of whom excel at developing this kind of alternate reality.","Many of those who do the inventing have particular political goals, such as the election of Trump, or the recruitment of Islamic State volunteers. But the longer-term impact of disinformation is even more profound: It creates cynicism and apathy. Eventually it means that nobody believes anything. People aren’t bothered by Trump’s lies — or Vladimir Putin’s lies, or the Islamic State’s lies — because they don’t believe anything they read anyway. There’s so much garbage information out there, it’s impossible to know what is true.","Nobody yet knows what to do about this sea change, because few people have even accepted that it is happening or understand how it works. There’s a wide-open space for Zuckerberg to help journalists, academics, activists and politicians figure out how to bring reality back into public debate. Maybe we need to study “media literacy” in schools; maybe we need independent “accuracy indexes” to rate websites; maybe we need to work on understanding the psychology of conspiracy theorists. We don’t know yet what works, but it’s time we started trying to figure it out. And that is a $45 billion question.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Anne ApplebaumAnne Applebaum is a Washington Post columnist, covering national politics and foreign policy, with a special focus on Europe and Russia.

Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

And some went as far as to suggest that it tipped the presidential contest. \"In an election where a total of about 115,000 votes would have changed the outcome, can you say that the false and misleading propaganda people saw on . . . Facebook didn't have an impact on the election?\" asked Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii).","I've run digital advertising campaigns on behalf of candidates in contested battleground states. And if the ads revealed this past week were an attempt to influence the election, they were a laughably botched and failed attempt. The total amount spent was less than what I've seen spent online in competitive congressional races. The ads were not well targeted to the battleground states that were most decisive. And the subject matter was designed to engage extremist voices on the political fringe, not persuadable voters undecided between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.","Vladimir Putin's propaganda victory is not the advertising itself, but the notion that just over $100,000 worth of poorly targeted Facebook advertising could swing a presidential election. It can't.","It is important for the United States to acknowledge that Russia's efforts were a direct attack on our democracy. But in the same way that we do not describe a terrorist attack as a victory for the terrorists, those seeking other explanations for November's results shouldn't succumb to the temptation to declare Russia's meddling decisive. Besides that being a greatly exaggerated view of Russia's capabilities, deeming the effort a geopolitical success emboldens Russia in its efforts to undermine Western democracies.","News of Russia's meddling has produced some scary-sounding numbers: as many as 126 million Americans reached on Facebook alone, a further 20 million on Instagram, and 1.4 million tweets sent by Russian-affiliated accounts in the two months leading up to the election.","Yet, the Russian content was just a tiny share of the 33 trillion posts Americans saw in their Facebook news feeds between 2015 and 2017. Any success the ads had in terms of reach seems attributable largely to the sheer doggedness of the effort, with 80,000 Facebook posts in total. Facebook reported that a quarter of the ads were never seen by anyone. And — with the average Facebook user sifting through 220 news-feed posts a day — many of the rest were simply glanced at, scrolled past and forgotten.","With $81 million spent on Facebook by the Trump and Clinton campaigns, mostly to mobilize core supporters to donate and volunteer, a low-six-figure buy is unlikely to have tipped the election. The Russian effort looks even less influential when one considers the tiny amount of Russian Facebook spending directed at key battleground states — $1,979 in Wisconsin, $823 in Michigan and $300 in Pennsylvania. From an electoral perspective, the campaign was remarkably unsophisticated.","Of course, some people did click and like and share. Where Russia appears to have made more headway — before and after the election — is in further animating partisans, capitalizing on their need to have their existing beliefs confirmed. It didn't matter that those confirming their beliefs were foreign adversaries.","In at least some cases, that translated into action. The most successful case appears to be an anti-Trump rally in New York City on Nov. 12, just five days after the election. More than 33,000 people expressed interest in an announcement of the event posted by Russian agents, and thousands ended up attending. The ad spending that we know of to promote the rally was piddling — $1.93 to serve the post to 188 people. Yet, touching a raw nerve, news of this event spread organically. And no one bothered to dig into the sockpuppet Facebook page behind the announcement.","Despite all the focus in the past week on ads, compared to friend-to-friend sharing, a relatively small share of the Russian campaign was driven by advertising. Just 10 million of the people reached came in through the advertising campaign, out of 29 million who directly read Russian posts in their news feeds, and up to 126 million who were exposed indirectly through their Facebook friends. The Russian effort depended on the willingness of some Americans to go along with it and share. The credulity of these social media users is a fact more troubling than the advertising itself, and one not as easily addressed by policy.","Broken English aside, if the Russian content struck some Facebook users as perfectly normal and even share-worthy, that's because it mimicked the hallmarks of popular social media content. Social media often performs best when it speaks emotionally to deep-seated cultural identity. That's why debates about race, gender and religion can rage in social media in a way that discussions of economic policy don't. The Russian posts deliberately spoke to the identity of their potential audience — as Christians or Muslims, as gun owners or LGBT Americans, as military veterans or supporters of Black Lives Matter. \"A 14-year-old Royce Mann brought hundreds of people to tears after he performed a slam poem on white privilege, police brutality, and the Black Lives Matter movement,\" read the most successful post, from the Russian-backed \"Blacktivists\" Facebook page — inspiring more than 300,000 interactions around a message indistinguishable from something homegrown. Other content was more vile and sinister, likening a Clinton victory to a Satanic triumph.","In the wake of these revelations, social media companies are likely to adopt policy fixes that will reduce the likelihood of foreign agents advertising directly to Americans. These include restrictions on the use of foreign currency to buy political ads and voluntary transparency measures. Proposals to warn users before sharing false content from dubious sources are positive, too. Legislative initiatives such as the Honest Ads Act also would bring greater transparency to political advertising, but would do very little to stop the vast majority of Russian ads that did not expressly support a candidate. Short of an upheaval significantly curtailing the use of social media as a vehicle for free expression, no legislation can prevent their use as vectors for misinformation or propaganda from foreign powers, particularly when social media is largely free and open for anyone to use. Only a more vigilant citizenry can provide a full-proof defense.","Changes by Congress or social media companies may solve this problem at a surface level. But the reason Russia was able to blend in to Americans' news feeds is that those ugly divisions were there to be exploited, and, in fact, that exploiting them remains a potentially effective and lucrative social media strategy — one that's used right here in the United States every day. That's an issue much bigger than stopping ads from being purchased in rubles."],"isopubdate":"2017-11-04"}

Mozilla, Tesla and other companies are distancing themselves from Facebook following revelations of a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP, File)","Watch it, Facebook: new EU data rules may have broad impact","Watch it, Facebook: new EU data rules may have broad impact","By DANICA KIRKA","Mar. 26, 2018","https://apnews.com/a1e572aa153b43398187ee8acd7f7578","Link copied!","LONDON (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company's subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.\"","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,\" he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.\""],"isopubdate":""}

When asked what had caused revenues to surge, Mozilla’s executive chair Mitchell Bakertold one journalist:","Because of the agreement with Google, that’s not something we can say too much about.","Despite this, in late 2014, Mozilla suddenly dumped Google in favour of setting Yahoo as its default search engine, ostensibly because Google’s Chrome browser was Firefox’s main rival.","When it launched Firefox Quantum last year, the deal with Yahoo was abruptly nixed and Mozilla and Google’s search was suddenly back as the default.","Confused?","It’s not clear what lay behind the ending of the Yahoo agreement, but it’s possible the Verizon takeover was a factor, or even the negative feeling around the Big Yahoo Breach that was disclosed in 2016. Mozilla chief legal officer Denelle Dixon said:","We exercised our contractual right to terminate our agreement with Yahoo based on a number of factors including doing what’s best for our brand, our effort to provide quality web search, and the broader content experience for our users.","Conscious of its image in a way few software companies are, Mozilla finds itself treading a difficult ethical path, caught between the outrageousness of what happened at Facebook and the reality that there is no easy escape from big internet companies.","The truth seems to be a bit simpler. It was Phoenix, but that clashed with Phoenix BIOS, so there was Firebird, but that clashed with another opem source project, so it became Firefox. A firefox is a red panda. And that’s it.

That number, the company’s preferred ‘metric’ when measuring its own size, means two billion different people used Facebook in the preceding month. It is hard to grasp just how extraordinary that is. Bear in mind that thefacebook – its original name – was launched exclusively for Harvard students in 2004. No human enterprise, no new technology or utility or service, has ever been adopted so widely so quickly. The speed of uptake far exceeds that of the internet itself, let alone ancient technologies such as television or cinema or radio.","Also amazing: as Facebook has grown, its users’ reliance on it has also grown. The increase in numbers is not, as one might expect, accompanied by a lower level of engagement. More does not mean worse – or worse, at least, from Facebook’s point of view. On the contrary. In the far distant days of October 2012, when Facebook hit one billion users, 55 per cent of them were using it every day. At two billion, 66 per cent are. Its user base is growing at 18 per cent a year – which you’d have thought impossible for a business already so enormous. Facebook’s biggest rival for logged-in users is YouTube, owned by its deadly rival Alphabet (the company formerly known as Google), in second place with 1.5 billion monthly users. Three of the next four biggest apps, or services, or whatever one wants to call them, are WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, with 1.2 billion, 1.2 billion, and 700 million users respectively (the Chinese app WeChat is the other one, with 889 million). Those three entities have something in common: they are all owned by Facebook. No wonder the company is the fifth most valuable in the world, with a market capitalisation of $445 billion.","Zuckerberg’s news about Facebook’s size came with an announcement which may or may not prove to be significant. He said that the company was changing its ‘mission statement’, its version of the canting pieties beloved of corporate America. Facebook’s mission used to be ‘making the world more open and connected’. A non-Facebooker reading that is likely to ask: why? Connection is presented as an end in itself, an inherently and automatically good thing. Is it, though? Flaubert was sceptical about trains because he thought (in Julian Barnes’s paraphrase) that ‘the railway would merely permit more people to move about, meet and be stupid.’ You don’t have to be as misanthropic as Flaubert to wonder if something similar isn’t true about connecting people on Facebook. For instance, Facebook is generally agreed to have played a big, perhaps even a crucial, role in the election of Donald Trump. The benefit to humanity is not clear. This thought, or something like it, seems to have occurred to Zuckerberg, because the new mission statement spells out a reason for all this connectedness. It says that the new mission is to ‘give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together’.","Hmm. Alphabet’s mission statement, ‘to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful’, came accompanied by the maxim ‘Don’t be evil,’ which has been the source of a lot of ridicule: Steve Jobs called it ‘bullshit’.[1] Which it is, but it isn’t only bullshit. Plenty of companies, indeed entire industries, base their business model on being evil. The insurance business, for instance, depends on the fact that insurers charge customers more than their insurance is worth; that’s fair enough, since if they didn’t do that they wouldn’t be viable as businesses. What isn’t fair is the panoply of cynical techniques that many insurers use to avoid, as far as possible, paying out when the insured-against event happens. Just ask anyone who has had a property suffer a major mishap. It’s worth saying ‘Don’t be evil,’ because lots of businesses are. This is especially an issue in the world of the internet. Internet companies are working in a field that is poorly understood (if understood at all) by customers and regulators. The stuff they’re doing, if they’re any good at all, is by definition new. In that overlapping area of novelty and ignorance and unregulation, it’s well worth reminding employees not to be evil, because if the company succeeds and grows, plenty of chances to be evil are going to come along.","Google and Facebook have both been walking this line from the beginning. Their styles of doing so are different. An internet entrepreneur I know has had dealings with both companies. ‘YouTube knows they have lots of dirty things going on and are keen to try and do some good to alleviate it,’ he told me. I asked what he meant by ‘dirty’. ‘Terrorist and extremist content, stolen content, copyright violations. That kind of thing. But Google in my experience knows that there are ambiguities, moral doubts, around some of what they do, and at least they try to think about it. Facebook just doesn’t care. When you’re in a room with them you can tell. They’re’ – he took a moment to find the right word – ‘scuzzy’.","That might sound harsh. There have, however, been ethical problems and ambiguities about Facebook since the moment of its creation, a fact we know because its creator was live-blogging at the time. The scene is as it was recounted in Aaron Sorkin’s movie about the birth of Facebook, The Social Network. While in his first year at Harvard, Zuckerberg suffered a romantic rebuff. Who wouldn’t respond to this by creating a website where undergraduates’ pictures are placed side by side so that users of the site can vote for the one they find more attractive? (The film makes it look as if it was only female undergraduates: in real life it was both.) The site was called Facemash. In the great man’s own words, at the time:","I’m a little intoxicated, I’m not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even 10 p.m. and it’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland dormitory facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of some farm animals and have people vote on which is the more attractive … Let the hacking begin.","As Tim Wu explains in his energetic and original new book The Attention Merchants, a ‘facebook’ in the sense Zuckerberg uses it here ‘traditionally referred to a physical booklet produced at American universities to promote socialisation in the way that “Hi, My Name Is” stickers do at events; the pages consisted of rows upon rows of head shots with the corresponding name’. Harvard was already working on an electronic version of its various dormitory facebooks. The leading social network, Friendster, already had three million users. The idea of putting these two things together was not entirely novel, but as Zuckerberg said at the time, ‘I think it’s kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week.’","Wu argues that capturing and reselling attention has been the basic model for a large number of modern businesses, from posters in late 19th-century Paris, through the invention of mass-market newspapers that made their money not through circulation but through ad sales, to the modern industries of advertising and ad-funded TV. Facebook is in a long line of such enterprises, though it might be the purest ever example of a company whose business is the capture and sale of attention. Very little new thinking was involved in its creation. As Wu observes, Facebook is ‘a business with an exceedingly low ratio of invention to success’. What Zuckerberg had instead of originality was the ability to get things done and to see the big issues clearly. The crucial thing with internet start-ups is the ability to execute plans and to adapt to changing circumstances. It’s Zuck’s skill at doing that – at hiring talented engineers, and at navigating the big-picture trends in his industry – that has taken his company to where it is today. Those two huge sister companies under Facebook’s giant wing, Instagram and WhatsApp, were bought for $1 billion and $19 billion respectively, at a point when they had no revenue. No banker or analyst or sage could have told Zuckerberg what those acquisitions were worth; nobody knew better than he did. He could see where things were going and help make them go there. That talent turned out to be worth several hundred billion dollars.","Jesse Eisenberg’s brilliant portrait of Zuckerberg in The Social Network is misleading, as Antonio García Martínez, a former Facebook manager, argues in Chaos Monkeys, his entertainingly caustic book about his time at the company. The movie Zuckerberg is a highly credible character, a computer genius located somewhere on the autistic spectrum with minimal to non-existent social skills. But that’s not what the man is really like. In real life, Zuckerberg was studying for a degree with a double concentration in computer science and – this is the part people tend to forget – psychology. People on the spectrum have a limited sense of how other people’s minds work; autists, it has been said, lack a ‘theory of mind’. Zuckerberg, not so much. He is very well aware of how people’s minds work and in particular of the social dynamics of popularity and status. The initial launch of Facebook was limited to people with a Harvard email address; the intention was to make access to the site seem exclusive and aspirational. (And also to control site traffic so that the servers never went down. Psychology and computer science, hand in hand.) Then it was extended to other elite campuses in the US. When it launched in the UK, it was limited to Oxbridge and the LSE. The idea was that people wanted to look at what other people like them were doing, to see their social networks, to compare, to boast and show off, to give full rein to every moment of longing and envy, to keep their noses pressed against the sweet-shop window of others’ lives.","This focus attracted the attention of Facebook’s first external investor, the now notorious Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Again, The Social Network gets it right: Thiel’s $500,000 investment in 2004 was crucial to the success of the company. But there was a particular reason Facebook caught Thiel’s eye, rooted in a byway of intellectual history. In the course of his studies at Stanford – he majored in philosophy – Thiel became interested in the ideas of the US-based French philosopher René Girard, as advocated in his most influential book, Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World. Girard’s big idea was something he called ‘mimetic desire’. Human beings are born with a need for food and shelter. Once these fundamental necessities of life have been acquired, we look around us at what other people are doing, and wanting, and we copy them. In Thiel’s summary, the idea is ‘that imitation is at the root of all behaviour’.","Girard was a Christian, and his view of human nature is that it is fallen. We don’t know what we want or who we are; we don’t really have values and beliefs of our own; what we have instead is an instinct to copy and compare. We are homo mimeticus. ‘Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and who turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.’ Look around, ye petty, and compare. The reason Thiel latched onto Facebook with such alacrity was that he saw in it for the first time a business that was Girardian to its core: built on people’s deep need to copy. ‘Facebook first spread by word of mouth, and it’s about word of mouth, so it’s doubly mimetic,’ Thiel said. ‘Social media proved to be more important than it looked, because it’s about our natures.’ We are keen to be seen as we want to be seen, and Facebook is the most popular tool humanity has ever had with which to do that.","*","The view of human nature implied by these ideas is pretty dark. If all people want to do is go and look at other people so that they can compare themselves to them and copy what they want – if that is the final, deepest truth about humanity and its motivations – then Facebook doesn’t really have to take too much trouble over humanity’s welfare, since all the bad things that happen to us are things we are doing to ourselves. For all the corporate uplift of its mission statement, Facebook is a company whose essential premise is misanthropic. It is perhaps for that reason that Facebook, more than any other company of its size, has a thread of malignity running through its story. The high-profile, tabloid version of this has come in the form of incidents such as the live-streaming of rapes, suicides, murders and cop-killings. But this is one of the areas where Facebook seems to me relatively blameless. People live-stream these terrible things over the site because it has the biggest audience; if Snapchat or Periscope were bigger, they’d be doing it there instead.","In many other areas, however, the site is far from blameless. The highest-profile recent criticisms of the company stem from its role in Trump’s election. There are two components to this, one of them implicit in the nature of the site, which has an inherent tendency to fragment and atomise its users into like-minded groups. The mission to ‘connect’ turns out to mean, in practice, connect with people who agree with you. We can’t prove just how dangerous these ‘filter bubbles’ are to our societies, but it seems clear that they are having a severe impact on our increasingly fragmented polity. Our conception of ‘we’ is becoming narrower.","This fragmentation created the conditions for the second strand of Facebook’s culpability in the Anglo-American political disasters of the last year. The portmanteau terms for these developments are ‘fake news’ and ‘post-truth’, and they were made possible by the retreat from a general agora of public debate into separate ideological bunkers. In the open air, fake news can be debated and exposed; on Facebook, if you aren’t a member of the community being served the lies, you’re quite likely never to know that they are in circulation. It’s crucial to this that Facebook has no financial interest in telling the truth. No company better exemplifies the internet-age dictum that if the product is free, you are the product. Facebook’s customers aren’t the people who are on the site: its customers are the advertisers who use its network and who relish its ability to direct ads to receptive audiences. Why would Facebook care if the news streaming over the site is fake? Its interest is in the targeting, not in the content. This is probably one reason for the change in the company’s mission statement. If your only interest is in connecting people, why would you care about falsehoods? They might even be better than the truth, since they are quicker to identify the like-minded. The newfound ambition to ‘build communities’ makes it seem as if the company is taking more of an interest in the consequence of the connections it fosters.","Fake news is not, as Facebook has acknowledged, the only way it was used to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. On 6 January 2017 the director of national intelligence published a report saying that the Russians had waged an internet disinformation campaign to damage Hillary Clinton and help Trump. ‘Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations – such as cyber-activity – with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or “trolls”,’ the report said. At the end of April, Facebook got around to admitting this (by then) fairly obvious truth, in an interesting paper published by its internal security division. ‘Fake news’, they argue, is an unhelpful, catch-all term because misinformation is in fact spread in a variety of ways:","Information (or Influence) Operations – Actions taken by governments or organised non-state actors to distort domestic or foreign political sentiment.","False News – News articles that purport to be factual, but which contain intentional misstatements of fact with the intention to arouse passions, attract viewership, or deceive.","False Amplifiers – Co-ordinated activity by inauthentic accounts with the intent of manipulating political discussion (e.g. by discouraging specific parties from participating in discussion, or amplifying sensationalistic voices over others).","Disinformation – Inaccurate or manipulated information/content that is spread intentionally. This can include false news, or it can involve more subtle methods, such as false flag operations, feeding inaccurate quotes or stories to innocent intermediaries, or knowingly amplifying biased or misleading information.","The company is promising to treat this problem or set of problems as seriously as it treats such other problems as malware, account hacking and spam. We’ll see. One man’s fake news is another’s truth-telling, and Facebook works hard at avoiding responsibility for the content on its site – except for sexual content, about which it is super-stringent. Nary a nipple on show. It’s a bizarre set of priorities, which only makes sense in an American context, where any whiff of explicit sexuality would immediately give the site a reputation for unwholesomeness. Photos of breastfeeding women are banned and rapidly get taken down. Lies and propaganda are fine.","The key to understanding this is to think about what advertisers want: they don’t want to appear next to pictures of breasts because it might damage their brands, but they don’t mind appearing alongside lies because the lies might be helping them find the consumers they’re trying to target. In Move Fast and Break Things, his polemic against the ‘digital-age robber barons’, Jonathan Taplin points to an analysis on Buzzfeed: ‘In the final three months of the US presidential campaign, the top-performing fake election news stories on Facebook generated more engagement than the top stories from major news outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, NBC News and others.’ This doesn’t sound like a problem Facebook will be in any hurry to fix.","The fact is that fraudulent content, and stolen content, are rife on Facebook, and the company doesn’t really mind, because it isn’t in its interest to mind. Much of the video content on the site is stolen from the people who created it. An illuminating YouTube video from Kurzgesagt, a German outfit that makes high-quality short explanatory films, notes that in 2015, 725 of Facebook’s top one thousand most viewed videos were stolen. This is another area where Facebook’s interests contradict society’s. We may collectively have an interest in sustaining creative and imaginative work in many different forms and on many platforms. Facebook doesn’t. It has two priorities, as Martínez explains in Chaos Monkeys: growth and monetisation. It simply doesn’t care where the content comes from. It is only now starting to care about the perception that much of the content is fraudulent, because if that perception were to become general, it might affect the amount of trust and therefore the amount of time people give to the site.","Zuckerberg himself has spoken up on this issue, in a Facebook post addressing the question of ‘Facebook and the election’. After a certain amount of boilerplate bullshit (‘Our goal is to give every person a voice. We believe deeply in people’), he gets to the nub of it. ‘Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.’ More than one Facebook user pointed out that in their own news feed, Zuckerberg’s post about authenticity ran next to fake news. In one case, the fake story pretended to be from the TV sports channel ESPN. When it was clicked on, it took users to an ad selling a diet supplement. As the writer Doc Searls pointed out, it’s a double fraud, ‘outright lies from a forged source’, which is quite something to have right slap next to the head of Facebook boasting about the absence of fraud. Evan Williams, co-founder of Twitter and founder of the long-read specialist Medium, found the same post by Zuckerberg next to a different fake ESPN story and another piece of fake news purporting to be from CNN, announcing that Congress had disqualified Trump from office. When clicked-through, that turned out to be from a company offering a 12-week programme to strengthen toes. (That’s right: strengthen toes.) Still, we now know that Zuck believes in people. That’s the main thing.","*","A neutral observer might wonder if Facebook’s attitude to content creators is sustainable. Facebook needs content, obviously, because that’s what the site consists of: content that other people have created. It’s just that it isn’t too keen on anyone apart from Facebook making any money from that content. Over time, that attitude is profoundly destructive to the creative and media industries. Access to an audience – that unprecedented two billion people – is a wonderful thing, but Facebook isn’t in any hurry to help you make money from it. If the content providers all eventually go broke, well, that might not be too much of a problem. There are, for now, lots of willing providers: anyone on Facebook is in a sense working for Facebook, adding value to the company. In 2014, the New York Times did the arithmetic and found that humanity was spending 39,757 collective years on the site, every single day. Jonathan Taplin points out that this is ‘almost fifteen million years of free labour per year’. That was back when it had a mere 1.23 billion users.","Taplin has worked in academia and in the film industry. The reason he feels so strongly about these questions is that he started out in the music business, as manager of The Band, and was on hand to watch the business being destroyed by the internet. What had been a $20 billion industry in 1999 was a $7 billion industry 15 years later. He saw musicians who had made a good living become destitute. That didn’t happen because people had stopped listening to their music – more people than ever were listening to it – but because music had become something people expected to be free. YouTube is the biggest source of music in the world, playing billions of tracks annually, but in 2015 musicians earned less from it and from its ad-supported rivals than they earned from sales of vinyl. Not CDs and recordings in general: vinyl.","Something similar has happened in the world of journalism. Facebook is in essence an advertising company which is indifferent to the content on its site except insofar as it helps to target and sell advertisements. A version of Gresham’s law is at work, in which fake news, which gets more clicks and is free to produce, drives out real news, which often tells people things they don’t want to hear, and is expensive to produce. In addition, Facebook uses an extensive set of tricks to increase its traffic and the revenue it makes from targeting ads, at the expense of the news-making institutions whose content it hosts. Its news feed directs traffic at you based not on your interests, but on how to make the maximum amount of advertising revenue from you. In September 2016, Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of the Guardian, told a Financial Times conference that Facebook had ‘sucked up $27 million’ of the newspaper’s projected ad revenue that year. ‘They are taking all the money because they have algorithms we don’t understand, which are a filter between what we do and how people receive it.’","This goes to the heart of the question of what Facebook is and what it does. For all the talk about connecting people, building community, and believing in people, Facebook is an advertising company. Martínez gives the clearest account both of how it ended up like that, and how Facebook advertising works. In the early years of Facebook, Zuckerberg was much more interested in the growth side of the company than in the monetisation. That changed when Facebook went in search of its big payday at the initial public offering, the shining day when shares in a business first go on sale to the general public. This is a huge turning-point for any start-up: in the case of many tech industry workers, the hope and expectation associated with ‘going public’ is what attracted them to their firm in the first place, and/or what has kept them glued to their workstations. It’s the point where the notional money of an early-days business turns into the real cash of a public company.","Martínez was there at the very moment when Zuck got everyone together to tell them they were going public, the moment when all Facebook employees knew that they were about to become rich:","I had chosen a seat behind a detached pair, who on further inspection turned out to be Chris Cox, head of FB product, and Naomi Gleit, a Harvard grad who joined as employee number 29, and was now reputed to be the current longest-serving employee other than Mark.","Naomi, between chats with Cox, was clicking away on her laptop, paying little attention to the Zuckian harangue. I peered over her shoulder at her screen. She was scrolling down an email with a number of links, and progressively clicking each one into existence as another tab on her browser. Clickathon finished, she began lingering on each with an appraiser’s eye. They were real estate listings, each for a different San Francisco property.","Martínez took note of one of the properties and looked it up later. Price: $2.4 million. He is fascinating, and fascinatingly bitter, on the subject of class and status differences in Silicon Valley, in particular the never publicly discussed issue of the huge gulf between early employees in a company, who have often been made unfathomably rich, and the wage slaves who join the firm later in its story. ‘The protocol is not to talk about it at all publicly.’ But, as Bonnie Brown, a masseuse at Google in the early days, wrote in her memoir, ‘a sharp contrast developed between Googlers working side by side. While one was looking at local movie times on their monitor, the other was booking a flight to Belize for the weekend. How was the conversation on Monday morning going to sound now?’","When the time came for the IPO, Facebook needed to turn from a company with amazing growth to one that was making amazing money. It was already making some, thanks to its sheer size – as Martínez observes, ‘a billion times any number is still a big fucking number’ – but not enough to guarantee a truly spectacular valuation on launch. It was at this stage that the question of how to monetise Facebook got Zuckerberg’s full attention. It’s interesting, and to his credit, that he hadn’t put too much focus on it before – perhaps because he isn’t particularly interested in money per se. But he does like to win.","The solution was to take the huge amount of information Facebook has about its ‘community’ and use it to let advertisers target ads with a specificity never known before, in any medium. Martínez: ‘It can be demographic in nature (e.g. 30-to-40-year-old females), geographic (people within five miles of Sarasota, Florida), or even based on Facebook profile data (do you have children; i.e. are you in the mommy segment?).’ Taplin makes the same point:","If I want to reach women between the ages of 25 and 30 in zip code 37206 who like country music and drink bourbon, Facebook can do that. Moreover, Facebook can often get friends of these women to post a ‘sponsored story’ on a targeted consumer’s news feed, so it doesn’t feel like an ad. As Zuckerberg said when he introduced Facebook Ads, ‘Nothing influences people more than a recommendation from a trusted friend. A trusted referral is the Holy Grail of advertising.’","That was the first part of the monetisation process for Facebook, when it turned its gigantic scale into a machine for making money. The company offered advertisers an unprecedentedly precise tool for targeting their ads at particular consumers. (Particular segments of voters too can be targeted with complete precision. One instance from 2016 was an anti-Clinton ad repeating a notorious speech she made in 1996 on the subject of ‘super-predators’. The ad was sent to African-American voters in areas where the Republicans were trying, successfully as it turned out, to suppress the Democrat vote. Nobody else saw the ads.)","The second big shift around monetisation came in 2012 when internet traffic began to switch away from desktop computers towards mobile devices. If you do most of your online reading on a desktop, you are in a minority. The switch was a potential disaster for all businesses which relied on internet advertising, because people don’t much like mobile ads, and were far less likely to click on them than on desktop ads. In other words, although general internet traffic was increasing rapidly, because the growth was coming from mobile, the traffic was becoming proportionately less valuable. If the trend were to continue, every internet business that depended on people clicking links – i.e. pretty much all of them, but especially the giants like Google and Facebook – would be worth much less money.","Facebook solved the problem by means of a technique called ‘onboarding’. As Martínez explains it, the best way to think about this is to consider our various kinds of name and address.","For example, if Bed, Bath and Beyond wants to get my attention with one of its wonderful 20 per cent off coupons, it calls out:","Antonio García Martínez1 Clarence Place #13San Francisco, CA 94107","If it wants to reach me on my mobile device, my name there is:","38400000-8cfo-11bd-b23e-10b96e40000d","That’s my quasi-immutable device ID, broadcast hundreds of times a day on mobile ad exchanges.","This is the content of the Facebook re-targeting cookie, which is used to target ads-are-you based on your mobile browsing.","Though it may not be obvious, each of these keys is associated with a wealth of our personal behaviour data: every website we’ve been to, many things we’ve bought in physical stores, and every app we’ve used and what we did there … The biggest thing going on in marketing right now, what is generating tens of billions of dollars in investment and endless scheming inside the bowels of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, is how to tie these different sets of names together, and who controls the links. That’s it.","Facebook already had a huge amount of information about people and their social networks and their professed likes and dislikes.[2] After waking up to the importance of monetisation, they added to their own data a huge new store of data about offline, real-world behaviour, acquired through partnerships with big companies such as Experian, which have been monitoring consumer purchases for decades via their relationships with direct marketing firms, credit card companies, and retailers. There doesn’t seem to be a one-word description of these firms: ‘consumer credit agencies’ or something similar about sums it up. Their reach is much broader than that makes it sound, though.[3] Experian says its data is based on more than 850 million records and claims to have information on 49.7 million UK adults living in 25.2 million households in 1.73 million postcodes. These firms know all there is to know about your name and address, your income and level of education, your relationship status, plus everywhere you’ve ever paid for anything with a card. Facebook could now put your identity together with the unique device identifier on your phone.","That was crucial to Facebook’s new profitability. On mobiles, people tend to prefer the internet to apps, which corral the information they gather and don’t share it with other companies. A game app on your phone is unlikely to know anything about you except the level you’ve got to on that particular game. But because everyone in the world is on Facebook, the company knows everyone’s phone identifier. It was now able to set up an ad server delivering far better targeted mobile ads than anyone else could manage, and it did so in a more elegant and well-integrated form than anyone else had managed.","So Facebook knows your phone ID and can add it to your Facebook ID. It puts that together with the rest of your online activity: not just every site you’ve ever visited, but every click you’ve ever made – the Facebook button tracks every Facebook user, whether they click on it or not. Since the Facebook button is pretty much ubiquitous on the net, this means that Facebook sees you, everywhere. Now, thanks to its partnerships with the old-school credit firms, Facebook knew who everybody was, where they lived, and everything they’d ever bought with plastic in a real-world offline shop.[4] All this information is used for a purpose which is, in the final analysis, profoundly bathetic. It is to sell you things via online ads.","The ads work on two models. In one of them, advertisers ask Facebook to target consumers from a particular demographic – our thirty-something bourbon-drinking country music fan, or our African American in Philadelphia who was lukewarm about Hillary. But Facebook also delivers ads via a process of online auctions, which happen in real time whenever you click on a website. Because every website you’ve ever visited (more or less) has planted a cookie on your web browser, when you go to a new site, there is a real-time auction, in millionths of a second, to decide what your eyeballs are worth and what ads should be served to them, based on what your interests, and income level and whatnot, are known to be. This is the reason ads have that disconcerting tendency to follow you around, so that you look at a new telly or a pair of shoes or a holiday destination, and they’re still turning up on every site you visit weeks later. This was how, by chucking talent and resources at the problem, Facebook was able to turn mobile from a potential revenue disaster to a great hot steamy geyser of profit.","What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business. Facebook, in fact, is the biggest surveillance-based enterprise in the history of mankind. It knows far, far more about you than the most intrusive government has ever known about its citizens. It’s amazing that people haven’t really understood this about the company. I’ve spent time thinking about Facebook, and the thing I keep coming back to is that its users don’t realise what it is the company does. What Facebook does is watch you, and then use what it knows about you and your behaviour to sell ads. I’m not sure there has ever been a more complete disconnect between what a company says it does – ‘connect’, ‘build communities’ – and the commercial reality. Note that the company’s knowledge about its users isn’t used merely to target ads but to shape the flow of news to them. Since there is so much content posted on the site, the algorithms used to filter and direct that content are the thing that determines what you see: people think their news feed is largely to do with their friends and interests, and it sort of is, with the crucial proviso that it is their friends and interests as mediated by the commercial interests of Facebook. Your eyes are directed towards the place where they are most valuable for Facebook.","*","I’m left wondering what will happen when and if this $450 billion penny drops. Wu’s history of attention merchants shows that there is a suggestive pattern here: that a boom is more often than not followed by a backlash, that a period of explosive growth triggers a public and sometimes legislative reaction. Wu’s first example is the draconian anti-poster laws introduced in early 20th-century Paris (and still in force – one reason the city is by contemporary standards undisfigured by ads). As Wu says, ‘when the commodity in question is access to people’s minds, the perpetual quest for growth ensures that forms of backlash, both major and minor, are all but inevitable.’ Wu calls a minor form of this phenomenon the ‘disenchantment effect’.","Facebook seems vulnerable to these disenchantment effects. One place they are likely to begin is in the core area of its business model – ad-selling. The advertising it sells is ‘programmatic’, i.e. determined by computer algorithms that match the customer to the advertiser and deliver ads accordingly, via targeting and/or online auctions. The problem with this from the customer’s point of view – remember, the customer here is the advertiser, not the Facebook user – is that a lot of the clicks on these ads are fake. There is a mismatch of interests here. Facebook wants clicks, because that’s how it gets paid: when ads are clicked on. But what if the clicks aren’t real but are instead automated clicks from fake accounts run by computer bots? This is a well-known problem, which particularly affects Google, because it’s easy to set up a site, allow it to host programmatic ads, then set up a bot to click on those ads, and collect the money that comes rolling in. On Facebook the fraudulent clicks are more likely to be from competitors trying to drive each others’ costs up.","The industry publication Ad Week estimates the annual cost of click fraud at $7 billion, about a sixth of the entire market. One single fraud site, Methbot, whose existence was exposed at the end of last year, uses a network of hacked computers to generate between three and five million dollars’ worth of fraudulent clicks every day. Estimates of fraudulent traffic’s market share are variable, with some guesses coming in at around 50 per cent; some website owners say their own data indicates a fraudulent-click rate of 90 per cent. This is by no means entirely Facebook’s problem, but it isn’t hard to imagine how it could lead to a big revolt against ‘ad tech’, as this technology is generally known, on the part of the companies who are paying for it. I’ve heard academics in the field say that there is a form of corporate groupthink in the world of the big buyers of advertising, who are currently responsible for directing large parts of their budgets towards Facebook. That mindset could change. Also, many of Facebook’s metrics are tilted to catch the light at the angle which makes them look shiniest. A video is counted as ‘viewed’ on Facebook if it runs for three seconds, even if the user is scrolling past it in her news feed and even if the sound is off. Many Facebook videos with hundreds of thousands of ‘views’, if counted by the techniques that are used to count television audiences, would have no viewers at all.","A customers’ revolt could overlap with a backlash from regulators and governments. Google and Facebook have what amounts to a monopoly on digital advertising. That monopoly power is becoming more and more important as advertising spend migrates online. Between them, they have already destroyed large sections of the newspaper industry. Facebook has done a huge amount to lower the quality of public debate and to ensure that it is easier than ever before to tell what Hitler approvingly called ‘big lies’ and broadcast them to a big audience. The company has no business need to care about that, but it is the kind of issue that could attract the attention of regulators.","That isn’t the only external threat to the Google/Facebook duopoly. The US attitude to anti-trust law was shaped by Robert Bork, the judge whom Reagan nominated for the Supreme Court but the Senate failed to confirm. Bork’s most influential legal stance came in the area of competition law. He promulgated the doctrine that the only form of anti-competitive action which matters concerns the prices paid by consumers. His idea was that if the price is falling that means the market is working, and no questions of monopoly need be addressed. This philosophy still shapes regulatory attitudes in the US and it’s the reason Amazon, for instance, has been left alone by regulators despite the manifestly monopolistic position it holds in the world of online retail, books especially.","The big internet enterprises seem invulnerable on these narrow grounds. Or they do until you consider the question of individualised pricing. The huge data trail we all leave behind as we move around the internet is increasingly used to target us with prices which aren’t like the tags attached to goods in a shop. On the contrary, they are dynamic, moving with our perceived ability to pay.[5] Four researchers based in Spain studied the phenomenon by creating automated personas to behave as if, in one case, ‘budget conscious’ and in another ‘affluent’, and then checking to see if their different behaviour led to different prices. It did: a search for headphones returned a set of results which were on average four times more expensive for the affluent persona. An airline-ticket discount site charged higher fares to the affluent consumer. In general, the location of the searcher caused prices to vary by as much as 166 per cent. So in short, yes, personalised prices are a thing, and the ability to create them depends on tracking us across the internet. That seems to me a prima facie violation of the American post-Bork monopoly laws, focused as they are entirely on price. It’s sort of funny, and also sort of grotesque, that an unprecedentedly huge apparatus of consumer surveillance is fine, apparently, but an unprecedentedly huge apparatus of consumer surveillance which results in some people paying higher prices may well be illegal.","Perhaps the biggest potential threat to Facebook is that its users might go off it. Two billion monthly active users is a lot of people, and the ‘network effects’ – the scale of the connectivity – are, obviously, extraordinary. But there are other internet companies which connect people on the same scale – Snapchat has 166 million daily users, Twitter 328 million monthly users – and as we’ve seen in the disappearance of Myspace, the onetime leader in social media, when people change their minds about a service, they can go off it hard and fast.","For that reason, were it to be generally understood that Facebook’s business model is based on surveillance, the company would be in danger. The one time Facebook did poll its users about the surveillance model was in 2011, when it proposed a change to its terms and conditions – the change that underpins the current template for its use of data. The result of the poll was clear: 90 per cent of the vote was against the changes. Facebook went ahead and made them anyway, on the grounds that so few people had voted. No surprise there, neither in the users’ distaste for surveillance nor in the company’s indifference to that distaste. But this is something which could change.","The other thing that could happen at the level of individual users is that people stop using Facebook because it makes them unhappy. This isn’t the same issue as the scandal in 2014 when it turned out that social scientists at the company had deliberately manipulated some people’s news feeds to see what effect, if any, it had on their emotions. The resulting paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was a study of ‘social contagion’, or the transfer of emotion among groups of people, as a result of a change in the nature of the stories seen by 689,003 users of Facebook. ‘When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.’ The scientists seem not to have considered how this information would be received, and the story played quite big for a while.","Perhaps the fact that people already knew this story accidentally deflected attention from what should have been a bigger scandal, exposed earlier this year in a paper from the American Journal of Epidemiology. The paper was titled ‘Association of Facebook Use with Compromised Well-Being: A Longitudinal Study’. The researchers found quite simply that the more people use Facebook, the more unhappy they are. In addition, they found that the positive effect of real-world interactions, which enhance well-being, was accurately paralleled by the ‘negative associations of Facebook use’. In effect people were swapping real relationships which made them feel good for time on Facebook which made them feel bad. That’s my gloss rather than that of the scientists, who take the trouble to make it clear that this is a correlation rather than a definite causal relationship, but they did go so far – unusually far – as to say that the data ‘suggests a possible trade-off between offline and online relationships’. This isn’t the first time something like this effect has been found. To sum up: there is a lot of research showing that Facebook makes people feel like shit. So maybe, one day, people will stop using it.[6]","*","What, though, if none of the above happens? What if advertisers don’t rebel, governments don’t act, users don’t quit, and the good ship Zuckerberg and all who sail in her continues blithely on? We should look again at that figure of two billion monthly active users. The total number of people who have any access to the internet – as broadly defined as possible, to include the slowest dial-up speeds and creakiest developing-world mobile service, as well as people who have access but don’t use it – is three and a half billion. Of those, about 750 million are in China and Iran, which block Facebook. Russians, about a hundred million of whom are on the net, tend not to use Facebook because they prefer their native copycat site VKontakte. So put the potential audience for the site at 2.6 billion. In developed countries where Facebook has been present for years, use of the site peaks at about 75 per cent of the population (that’s in the US). That would imply a total potential audience for Facebook of 1.95 billion. At two billion monthly active users, Facebook has already gone past that number, and is running out of connected humans. Martínez compares Zuckerberg to Alexander the Great, weeping because he has no more worlds to conquer. Perhaps this is one reason for the early signals Zuck has sent about running for president – the fifty-state pretending-to-give-a-shit tour, the thoughtful-listening pose he’s photographed in while sharing milkshakes in (Presidential Ambitions klaxon!) an Iowa diner.","Whatever comes next will take us back to those two pillars of the company, growth and monetisation. Growth can only come from connecting new areas of the planet. An early experiment came in the form of Free Basics, a program offering internet connectivity to remote villages in India, with the proviso that the range of sites on offer should be controlled by Facebook. ‘Who could possibly be against this?’ Zuckerberg wrote in the Times of India. The answer: lots and lots of angry Indians. The government ruled that Facebook shouldn’t be able to ‘shape users’ internet experience’ by restricting access to the broader internet. A Facebook board member tweeted that ‘anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?’ As Taplin points out, that remark ‘unwittingly revealed a previously unspoken truth: Facebook and Google are the new colonial powers.’","So the growth side of the equation is not without its challenges, technological as well as political. Google (which has a similar running-out-of-humans problem) is working on ‘Project Loon’, ‘a network of balloons travelling on the edge of space, designed to extend internet connectivity to people in rural and remote areas worldwide’. Facebook is working on a project involving a solar-powered drone called the Aquila, which has the wingspan of a commercial airliner, weighs less than a car, and when cruising uses less energy than a microwave oven. The idea is that it will circle remote, currently unconnected areas of the planet, for flights that last as long as three months at a time. It connects users via laser and was developed in Bridgwater, Somerset. (Amazon’s drone programme is based in the UK too, near Cambridge. Our legal regime is pro-drone.) Even the most hardened Facebook sceptic has to be a little bit impressed by the ambition and energy. But the fact remains that the next two billion users are going to be hard to find.","That’s growth, which will mainly happen in the developing world. Here in the rich world, the focus is more on monetisation, and it’s in this area that I have to admit something which is probably already apparent. I am scared of Facebook. The company’s ambition, its ruthlessness, and its lack of a moral compass scare me. It goes back to that moment of its creation, Zuckerberg at his keyboard after a few drinks creating a website to compare people’s appearance, not for any real reason other than that he was able to do it. That’s the crucial thing about Facebook, the main thing which isn’t understood about its motivation: it does things because it can. Zuckerberg knows how to do something, and other people don’t, so he does it. Motivation of that type doesn’t work in the Hollywood version of life, so Aaron Sorkin had to give Zuck a motive to do with social aspiration and rejection. But that’s wrong, completely wrong. He isn’t motivated by that kind of garden-variety psychology. He does this because he can, and justifications about ‘connection’ and ‘community’ are ex post facto rationalisations. The drive is simpler and more basic. That’s why the impulse to growth has been so fundamental to the company, which is in many respects more like a virus than it is like a business. Grow and multiply and monetise. Why? There is no why. Because.","Automation and artificial intelligence are going to have a big impact in all kinds of worlds. These technologies are new and real and they are coming soon. Facebook is deeply interested in these trends. We don’t know where this is going, we don’t know what the social costs and consequences will be, we don’t know what will be the next area of life to be hollowed out, the next business model to be destroyed, the next company to go the way of Polaroid or the next business to go the way of journalism or the next set of tools and techniques to become available to the people who used Facebook to manipulate the elections of 2016. We just don’t know what’s next, but we know it’s likely to be consequential, and that a big part will be played by the world’s biggest social network. On the evidence of Facebook’s actions so far, it’s impossible to face this prospect without unease.","[1] When Google relaunched as Alphabet, ‘Don’t be evil’ was replaced as an official corporate code of conduct by ‘Do the right thing.’","[2] Note the ‘professed’. As Seth Stephens-Davidowitz points out in his new book Everybody Lies (Bloomsbury, £20), researchers have studied the difference between the language used on Google, where people tend to tell the truth because they are anonymously looking for answers, and the language used on Facebook, where people are projecting an image. On Facebook, the most common terms associated with the phrase ‘my husband is …’ are ‘the best’, ‘my best friend’, ‘amazing’, ‘the greatest’ and ‘so cute’. On Google, the top five are ‘amazing’, ‘a jerk’, ‘annoying’, ‘gay’ and ‘mean’. It would be interesting to know if there’s a husband out there who achieves the full Google set and is an amazing annoying mean gay jerk.","[3] One example of their work is Experian’s ‘Mosaic’ system of characterising consumer segments, which divides the population into 66 segments, from ‘Cafés and Catchments’ to ‘Penthouse Chic’, ‘Classic Grandparents’ and ‘Bus-Route Renters’.","[4] I should say that the information is hashed before it is exchanged, so that although the respective companies know everything about you and do share it, they do so in a pseudonymised form. Or a pseudo-pseudonymised form; there is an argument to be had about just how anonymous this form of anonymity actually is.","[5] The idea of one price for everyone is relatively recent. John Wanamaker gets the credit for having come up with the notion of fixed price tags in Philadelphia in 1861. The idea came from the Quakers, who thought that everyone should be treated equally.","[6] A study from 2015 in Computers in Human Behaviour, ‘Facebook Use, Envy and Depression among College Students: Is Facebooking Depressing?’ came to the answer no – except when the effects of envy were included, in which case the answer was yes. But since envious comparison is the entire Girardian basis of Facebook, that qualified ‘no’ looks an awful lot like a ‘yes’. A 2016 paper in Current Opinion in Psychiatry that studied ‘The Interplay between Facebook Use, Social Comparison, Envy and Depression’ found that Facebook use is linked to envy and depression, another discovery that would come as no surprise to Girard. A paper from 2013 in Plos One showed that ‘Facebook Use Predicts Declines in Subjective Well-Being in Young Adults’: in other words, Facebook makes young people sad. A 2016 paper in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking, entitled ‘The Facebook Experiment: Quitting Facebook Leads to Higher Levels of Well-Being’, found that Facebook makes people sad and that people were happier when they stopped using it.","Letters","The appearance in the same issue of John Lanchester’s article on Facebook and Marina Warner’s review of Thomas Laqueur’s The Work of the Dead had me reflecting on a new sort of mourning that social media has brought about (LRB, 17 August). My father has been dead for six years, but his Facebook profile has gone on existing. I have occasionally visited it. People have continued to post there, often on his birthday, saying things like, ‘Hope you’re having a ball up there.’ Such posts are public acts; others ‘like’ them or add comments in support.","It can be unnerving to receive an automated social media notification reminding you to wish happy birthday to a dead person. I have imagined what it would be like if I knew my dad’s password and logged onto his profile. I suppose there would be messages from old schoolfriends who haven’t heard he has died, but also invitations to play Candy Crush and advertising targeted on the basis of the ‘likes’ he registered when he was still alive. His ashes were scattered in the garden of my parents’ house, which my mother will probably sell next year; after that, his Facebook profile may be the only place left to go when I’m feeling mawkish and want to ‘visit’ him.","Johnnie Bicket\nLondon N7","John Lanchester’s mention of Flaubert’s disparagement of trains that ‘merely permit more people to move about, meet and be stupid’ recalls Matthew Arnold’s similarly technophobic characterisation of the Atlantic telegraph, in the mouth of his character Arminius in Friendship’s Garland (1871): ‘that great rope, with a Philistine at each end of it talking inutilities!’ Often, when I start to tap out my inutile 140 characters on Twitter, this phrase comes uneasily to mind."],"isopubdate":""}

As Britain heads to the polls again, is our electoral process still fit for purpose?","This article is the subject of legal complaints on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC and SCL Elections Limited.","“The connectivity that is the heart of globalisation can be exploited by states with hostile intent to further their aims.[…] The risks at stake are profound and represent a fundamental threat to our sovereignty.” Alex Younger, head of MI6, December, 2016","“It’s not MI6’s job to warn of internal threats. It was a very strange speech. Was it one branch of the intelligence services sending a shot across the bows of another? Or was it pointed at Theresa May’s government? Does she know something she’s not telling us?”Senior intelligence analyst, April 2017","In January 2013, a young American postgraduate was passing through London when she was called up by the boss of a firm where she’d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned.","Follow the data: does a legal document link Brexit campaigns to US billionaire?","Read more","“That was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,” a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I’ll call Paul tells me. “It was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.”","Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.”","Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.”","On that day in January 2013, the intern met up with SCL’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. “She said, ‘You really need to get into data.’ She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she mentioned to him a firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.”","I had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world – including GCHQ and the NSA. It’s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and major investor in Facebook, who became Silicon Valley’s first vocal supporter of Trump.","In some ways, an intern showing up and referring to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched.","A weird but telling detail. Because it goes to the heart of why the story of Cambridge Analytica is one of the most profoundly unsettling of our time. What’s clear is that the power and dominance of the Silicon Valley – Google and Facebook and a small handful of others – are at the centre of the global tectonic shift we are currently witnessing.","It also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump.","There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.","My entry point into this story began, as so many things do, with a late-night Google. Last December, I took an unsettling tumble into a wormhole of Google autocomplete suggestions that ended with “did the holocaust happen”. And an entire page of results that claimed it didn’t.","Google’s algorithm had been gamed by extremist sites and it was Jonathan Albright, a professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, who helped me get to grips with what I was seeing. He was the first person to map and uncover an entire “alt-right” news and information ecosystem and he was the one who first introduced me to Cambridge Analytica.","He called the company a central point in the right’s “propaganda machine”, a line I quoted in reference to its work for the Trump election campaign and the referendum Leave campaign. That led to the second article featuring Cambridge Analytica – as a central node in the alternative news and information network that I believed Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon, the key Trump aide who is now his chief strategist, were creating. I found evidence suggesting they were on a strategic mission to smash the mainstream media and replace it with one comprising alternative facts, fake history and rightwing propaganda.","Mercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to “help” the Leave campaign.","The second article triggered two investigations, which are both continuing: one by the Information Commissioner’s Office into the possible illegal use of data. And a second by the Electoral Commission which is “focused on whether one or more donations – including services – accepted by Leave.EU was ‘impermissable’”.","What I then discovered is that Mercer’s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia.","It was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend £3.9m, more than half its official £7m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further £757,750. “Coordination” between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn’t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission “looked into this” and gave it “a clean bill of health”.","How did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It’s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King’s College London has been asking too. “I went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.”","Moore contributed to an LSE report published in April that concluded UK’s electoral laws were “weak and helpless” in the face of new forms of digital campaigning. Offshore companies, money poured into databases, unfettered third parties… the caps on spending had come off. The laws that had always underpinned Britain’s electoral laws were no longer fit for purpose. Laws, the report said, that needed “urgently reviewing by parliament”.","AggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ’s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its overseas office: “SCL Canada”. A day later, that online reference vanished.","There had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone – AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave – denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term “contractor” to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered.","Then I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. “It’s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so… messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we’d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can’t get my head around it.”","He laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. “Find Chris Wylie,” he said.","Who’s Chris Wylie?","“He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he’s from west Canada. It’s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They’re his friends. He’s the one who brought them in.”","There wasn’t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer’s distributed empire. “The Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.”","Key to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it’s a letter from “Director of Defence Operations, SCL Group”, that helped me realise this. It’s from “Commander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)” complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word “disinformation”.","I wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he’d written to “deception” and “propaganda”, which I said I understood to be “roughly synonymous with ‘disinformation’.” It’s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I’m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections.","What’s been lost in the US coverage of this “data analytics” firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron’s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder.","Steve Tatham was the head of psychological operations for British forces in Afghanistan. The Observer has seen letters endorsing him from the UK Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and Nato.","SCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It’s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group.","This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”","Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.","And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.","Facebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale.","The company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets – on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel – and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people’s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. “The goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter’s information environment,” said David. “And the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.”","Finding “persuadable” voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants “swamping” the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter.","Cambridge Analytica worked on campaigns in several key states for a Republican political action committee. Its key objective, according to a memo the Observer has seen, was “voter disengagement” and “to persuade Democrat voters to stay at home”: a profoundly disquieting tactic. It has previously been claimed that suppression tactics were used in the campaign, but this document provides the first actual evidence.","But does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others’ articles is that Cambridge Analytica’s “special sauce” has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy?","“It’s not a political consultancy,” says David. “You have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don’t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It’s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots – controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.”","Tamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military’s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. “The capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can’t even see, don’t even realise is happening to them,” she says. “It’s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling.","“We are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That’s a very worrying situation.”","Google is not ‘just’ a platform. It frames, shapes and distorts how we see the world","Read more","A project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ – the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave – was brought in to build the targeting platform.","David said: “The standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it’s often some bullshit health project that’s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad’s national security council.”","The security work was to be the prize for the political work. Documents seen by the Observer show that this was a proposal to capture citizens’ browsing history en masse, recording phone conversations and applying natural language processing to the recorded voice data to construct a national police database, complete with scores for each citizen on their propensity to commit crime.","“The plan put to the minister was Minority Report. It was pre-crime. And the fact that Cambridge Analytica is now working inside the Pentagon is, I think, absolutely terrifying,” said David.","These documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for “military and homeland security work”.","In the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state?","A state that is bringing corporate interests into the heart of the administration. Documents detail Cambridge Analytica is involved with many other right-leaning billionaires, including Rupert Murdoch. One memo references Cambridge Analytica trying to place an article with a journalist in Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal: “RM re-channeled and connected with Jamie McCauley from Robert Thomson News Corp office,” it says.","It makes me think again about the story involving the intern, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed.","Further documents seen by the Observer confirm that at least one senior Palantir employee consulted with Cambridge Analytica in relation to the Trinidad project and later political work in the US. But at the time, I’m told, Palantir decided it was too much of a reputational risk for a more formal arrangement. There was no upside to it. Palantir is a company that is trusted to handle vast datasets on UK and US citizens for GCHQ and the NSA, as well as many other countries.","Now though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica.","A leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in.","“On the one hand, it’s being done by companies and governments who say ‘you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend’. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.”","In Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling.","The details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL’s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington.","When my article linking Mercer and Leave.EU was published in February, no one was more upset about it than former Tory adviser Dominic Cummings, the campaign strategist for Vote Leave. He launched an irate Twitter tirade. The piece was “full of errors & itself spreads disinformation” “CA had ~0% role in Brexit referendum”.","Questions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups – £625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and £100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ.","The Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it “a clean bill of health”.","On his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He “hired physicists” is all he’ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about “Dom’s astrophysicists”, who he kept “a tightly guarded secret”. They built models, using data “scraped” off Facebook.","Finally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: “The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.” But, he says, “by encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer’s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues”.","And to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: “Someone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me – let’s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we’d spoken to in London.”","The most unfortunate aspect of this – for Dominic Cummings – is that this isn’t credible. It’s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for “Aggregate IQ”. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn’t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact.","But what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They’re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as “micro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad” and “direct communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns”.","And Borwick wasn’t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave’s chief technology officer.","This story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. “AggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,” David told me. “Almost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn’t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica’s database platforms.”","Cummings won’t say who did his modelling. But invoices lodged with the Electoral Commission show payments to a company called Advanced Skills Institute. It takes me weeks to spot the significance of this because the company is usually referred to as ASI Data Science, a company that has a revolving cast of data scientists who have gone on to work with Cambridge Analytica and vice versa. There are videos of ASI data scientists presenting Cambridge Analytica personality models and pages for events the two companies have jointly hosted. ASI told the Observer it had no formal relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","Here’s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn’t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between “Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave”, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: “Cambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.”","This story isn’t about cunning Dominic Cummings finding a few loopholes in the Electoral Commission’s rules. Finding a way to spend an extra million quid here. Or (as the Observer has also discovered )underdeclaring the costs of his physicists on the spending returns by £43,000. This story is not even about what appears to be covert coordination between Vote Leave and Leave.EU in their use of AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica. It’s about how a motivated US billionaire – Mercer and his chief ideologue, Bannon – helped to bring about the biggest constitutional change to Britain in a century.","Because to understand where and how Brexit is connected to Trump, it’s right here. These relationships, which thread through the middle of Cambridge Analytica, are the result of a transatlantic partnership that stretches back years. Nigel Farage and Bannon have been close associates since at least 2012. Bannon opened the London arm of his news website Breitbart in 2014 to support Ukip – the latest front “in our current cultural and political war”, he told the New York Times.","Britain had always been key to Bannon’s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order.","“He believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.”","On 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings’s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group £100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as “persuadable” were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days.","I asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain’s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ.","“I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There’s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn’t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they’d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.”","It seems clear to me that David Banks didn’t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He’s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don’t think he knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played.","And that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to “about 600,000 people – just over 1% of registered voters”. It’s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too.","For the last month, I’ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica.","A map shown to the Observer showing the many places in the world where SCL and Cambridge Analytica have worked includes Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Iran and Moldova. Multiple Cambridge Analytica sources have revealed other links to Russia, including trips to the country, meetings with executives from Russian state-owned companies, and references by SCL employees to working for Russian entities.","What Brexit should have taught us about voter manipulation | Paul Flynn","Read more","Article 50 has been triggered. AggregateIQ is outside British jurisdiction. The Electoral Commission is powerless. And another election, with these same rules, is just a month away. It is not that the authorities don’t know there is cause for concern. The Observer has learned that the Crown Prosecution Service did appoint a special prosecutor to assess whether there was a case for a criminal investigation into whether campaign finance laws were broken. The CPS referred it back to the electoral commission. Someone close to the intelligence select committee tells me that “work is being done” on potential Russian interference in the referendum.","Gavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as “highly disturbing”. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump’s America.","Martin Moore of King’s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. “Look at Erdoğan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It’s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It’s not about a battle of policy between two parties.”","This is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a “managed” democracy. Paid for by a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us. If we let this referendum result stand, we are giving it our implicit consent. This isn’t about Remain or Leave. It goes far beyond party politics.

The story has been corrected. See below for full correction.","Cambridge Analytica may have had access to the personal information of tens of millions of unwitting Americans, but a genuine debate has emerged about whether the company had the sophistication to put that data effectively to use on behalf of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.","But one other organization that has ready access to Facebook’s trove of personal data has a much better track record of using such information effectively: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.","ICE, the federal agency tasked with Trump’s program of mass deportation, uses backend Facebook data to locate and track suspects, according to a string of emails and documents obtained by The Intercept through a public records request. The hunt for one particular suspect provides a rare window into how ICE agents use social media and powerful data analytics tools to find targets.","ICE agents were able to obtain backend Facebook data revealing a log of when the account was accessed and the IP addresses corresponding to each login.","In February and March of 2017, several ICE agents were in communication with a detective from Las Cruces, New Mexico, to find information about a particular person. They were ultimately able to obtain backend Facebook data revealing a log of when the account was accessed and the IP addresses corresponding to each login. Lea Whitis, an agent with Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of ICE, emailed the team a “Facebook Business Record” revealing the suspect’s phone number and the locations of each login into his account during a date range.","Law enforcement agents routinely use bank, telephone, and internet records for investigations, but the extent to which ICE uses social media is not well known.","A Facebook spokesperson, in a statement, said that ICE does not have any unique access to data:","Facebook does not provide ICE or any other law enforcement agency with any special data access to assist with the enforcement of immigration law. We have strict processes in place to handle these government requests. Every request we receive is checked for legal sufficiency. We require officials to provide a detailed description of the legal and factual basis for their request, and we push back when we find legal deficiencies or overly broad or vague demands for information.","In this case, our records show that ICE sent valid legal process to us in an investigation said to involve an active child predator. We take the enforcement of laws protecting children from child predators very seriously, and we responded to ICE’s valid request with data consistent with our publicly available data disclosure standards. ICE did not identify any immigration law violations in connection with its data request to Facebook in this case.","One of the agents involved in the hunt responded that they could combine the data with “IP address information back from T-Mobile.” Another agent chimed in to say that the agency had sent the phone company an expedited summons for information.","“I am going to see if our Palantir guy is here to dump the Western Union info in there since I know there is a way to triangulate the area he’s sending money from and narrow down time of day etc,” responded Jen Miller, an ICE agent on the email thread.","Palantir is a controversial data analytics firm co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel. The company, which does business with the military and major intelligence agencies, has contracted with ICE since 2014. As journalist Spencer Woodman reported last year, the company developed a special system for ICE to access a vast “ecosystem” of data to facilitate immigration officials in both discovering targets and then creating and administering cases against them.","But there is little public disclosure of how ICE uses the Palantir platform to track individuals. The emails obtained by The Intercept show that private Facebook information is yet another data point for agents in pursuit of a suspect.","“I have not heard of HSI going and getting private information from Facebook. What we’ve been seeing is when they use someone’s Facebook page and print what they’ve been posting to use as evidence to argue that person is a gang member,” said Rachel K. Prandini, staff attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.","Matthew Bourke, a spokesperson for ICE, emailed The Intercept to say the agency would not “comment on investigative techniques or tactics other than to say that during the course of a criminal investigation, we have the ability to seek subpoenas and court orders to legally compel a company to provide information that may assist in case completion and subsequent prosecution.”","“Court orders are an established procedure that is consistent with all other federal law enforcement agencies. Additionally, investigators can use open-source information that is readily available on various social-media platforms during the course of an investigation,” Bourke added.","The Stored Communications Act provides broad powers for law enforcement to request information from communication service providers, including Facebook. The law delineates a variety of types of data that can be requested, much of it without a court order.","Facebook publishes a semiannual transparency report detailing the number of government requests for user data. The report does not break down which law enforcement agencies are making the requests for data, so it is unclear how many of the requests came from ICE.","The report reveals that from January 2017 through June 2017, Facebook received 32,716 requests for data from 52,280 users. Facebook notes in its report that it complied with 85 percent of the requests and “approximately 57% of legal process we received from authorities in the U.S. was accompanied by a non-disclosure order legally prohibiting us from notifying the affected users.”","“Occasionally companies will push back, but that’s relatively rare,” says Nathan Wessler, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “From time to time, companies will push back if they receive what they perceive to be a grossly over-broad request, like a true dragnet request, or if there’s a request for example to unmask the identity of someone who is engaging in First Amendment-protected speech online anonymously. But they — for the vast majority of the requests — they comply.”","“For these subpoenas, it’s trivially easy for ICE or any other law enforcement agencies to issue,” explained Wessler. “They don’t require the involvement of a judge ahead of time. It’s really just a piece of paper that they’ve prepared ahead of time, a form, and they fill in a couple of pieces of information about what they’re looking for and they self-certify what they’re looking for is relevant to an ongoing investigation.”","Facebook is facing increasing demands about how it manages user data.","Facebook is facing increasing demands about how it manages user data. Recent reports from a whistleblower have refocused attention on the Silicon Valley company for allowing Cambridge Analytica, a campaign consulting firm that served groups supporting Trump’s presidential campaign, access to user data.","Though Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have provided political support for immigration reform efforts in the past, the company has received relatively little scrutiny for its role in ICE’s deportation machine. Last year, ICE agents requested private Facebook data to obtain a cellphone number for an unauthorized immigrant in Detroit who they were pursuing. That number was then tracked through a cell site simulator, a powerful surveillance tool used to vacuum cellphone calls and user location data.","The agency appears to continue its search for greater technology tools to track and apprehend unauthorized immigrants. Last month, ICE released a request for proposal for a private contractor to provide tools to track target employment data, credit checks, vehicle accident reports, pay day loans, and other data sources. The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, has made aggressive new efforts to obtain social media data from those entering and exiting the country.","Wessler noted that the use of Facebook data combined with Palantir shows the agency is expanding its reach.","“It speaks to the importance of companies like Palantir to have tremendous ability to amass a great deal of information about people, Wessler said. “Just because a federal agency can pay for a contract to provide a service doesn’t mean it is a good idea when it’s enabling a massive deportation apparatus without appropriate checks and balances.”","Correction: March 26, 2018Due to errors by editor Ryan Grim, this story and its headline originally reported that the investigation referred to in the ICE emails targeted an immigrant. The story as filed did not include those errors, or any others. The documents reported on in the story do not establish that the target of the investigation was an immigrant or that the individual was being pursued for immigration violations. The target of the investigation was, according to the documents, based in the New York metropolitan area, while several of the ICE agents on the emails were based in New Mexico. Additionally, this story has been updated to include a comment from Facebook.","Top photo: Immigrant advocates on Feb. 10, 2017, decried a series of arrests that federal deportation agents said aimed to round up criminals in southern California, but they believe mark a shift in enforcement under the Trump administration."],"isopubdate":""}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts.

With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a Democratic member of the committee, not the ranking Democratic member. (The ranking Democrat is Senator Dianne Feinstein.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Over the weekend, some Facebook archives were found to contain this call and text data from connected Android smartphones. It wasn’t very difficult to find this out either.

By the end of this year nearly 100 million people are predicted to be paying members of Spotify. The streaming music service currently has around 75 million paid subscribers. That’s roughly double Apple Music’s 36 million users. Predicting 25% growth in paid subscribers this year, Spotify is prioritizing growth over profits to compete with Apple.","Spotify will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3rd under the ticker symbol SA. This isn’t a typical IPO with most of the shares sold ahead of time. Spotify is opting for a rare direct listing which means the initial stock price will be anyone’s guess.","For some people, going to a car dealership to test drive cars is about as pleasant as going to the dentist.

It’s also an effort to clarify the situation by emphasizing that Facebook has already prevented third-party apps from “getting so much information,” and that the company has begun “limiting the data apps get when you sign up.”","“This was a breach of trust and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” writes Zuckerberg in the ads. “We’re now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","In bigger font, the ad begins with: “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.” It ended with a Zuckerberg’s signature.","Zuckerberg’s first Facebook post confronting the scandal last Wednesday did not include an apology. The billionaire only started apologizing in a televised broadcast interview with CNN Senior Tech Correspondent Laurie Segall. The CNN interview comes only after days of absence of a response from Facebook’s top management on the subject. The Cambridge Analytica scandal was clearly exposed a little over a week ago.","The ad refers to “a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014.”","A London-based data mining and analytics company gained access to as many as 50 million Facebook profiles. The data, sold to Cambridge Analytica against Facebook’s terms of service, was used by election ad targeting toolset in the presidential campaign of Donald Trump and others.","The aftermath of the scandal: numerous lawsuits, a #DeleteFacebook movement with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other big names acting on the hashtag, including WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, and a sharp drop in Facebook share price damaging Zuckerberg’s net worth by $10 billion.","Good questions……To me “SORRY” on exposing ones PERSONAL information , is TOO LITTLE , TOO LATE !!! This is inexcusable !!! THIS is a very serious problem for some facebookers . I think it is THEIR responsibility to inform EACH person if they have BEEN hacked, and if there has been action taken to protect their data !!!!! I would maybe feel a little less violated !! I KNOW…..I KNOW we are talking about a TREMENDOUS number of facebookers…..BUT ….THEY MADE the problem…..BE RESPONSIDLE !!! Don’t even say “sorry” , that DOES nothing !!","After reading these comment, it surprises me no one is suggesting a class action lawsuit. So I guess I will. Then, instead of suggesting we get paid a million each, Facebook will be forced to compensate."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

There’s no need to get experiment participants to sign pesky consent forms as they’ve already agreed to the site’s data use policy. A team of Facebook data scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to study human behavior through the social network. When the team releases papers about what it's learned from us, we often learn surprising things about Facebook instead -- such as the fact that it can keep track of the status updates we never actually post. Facebook has played around with manipulating people before -- getting 60,000 to rock the vote in 2010 that theoretically wouldn't have otherwise -- but a recent study shows Facebook playing a whole new level of mind gamery with its guinea pigs users. As first noted by The New Scientist and Animal New York, Facebook's data scientists manipulated the News Feeds of 689,003 users, removing either all of the positive posts or all of the negative posts to see how it affected their moods. If there was a week in January 2012 where you were only seeing photos of dead dogs or incredibly cute babies, you may have been part of the study. Now that the experiment is public, people's mood about the study itself would best be described as \"disturbed.\"","The researchers, led by data scientist Adam Kramer, found that emotions were contagious. \"When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,\" according to the paper published by the Facebook research team in the PNAS. \"These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.\"","The experiment ran for a week -- January 11–18, 2012 -- during which the hundreds of thousands of Facebook users unknowingly participating may have felt either happier or more depressed than usual, as they saw either more of their friends posting '15 Photos That Restore Our Faith In Humanity' articles or despondent status updates about losing jobs, getting screwed over by X airline, and already failing to live up to New Year's resolutions. \"*Probably* nobody was driven to suicide,\" tweeted one professor linking to the study, adding a \"#jokingnotjoking\" hashtag.","The researchers -- who may not have been thinking about the optics of a \"Facebook emotionally manipulates users\" study -- jauntily note that the study undermines people who claim that looking at our friends' good lives on Facebook makes us feel depressed. \"The fact that people were more emotionally positive in response to positive emotion updates from their friends stands in contrast to theories that suggest viewing positive posts by friends on Facebook may somehow affect us negatively,\" they write.","They also note that when they took all of the emotional posts out of a person's News Feed, that person became \"less expressive,\" i.e. wrote fewer status updates. So prepare to have Facebook curate your feed with the most emotional of your friends' posts if they feel you're not posting often enough.","So is it okay for Facebook to play mind games with us for science? It's a cool finding but manipulating unknowing users' emotional states to get there puts Facebook's big toe on that creepy line. Facebook's data use policy -- that I'm sure you've all read -- says Facebookers' information will be used \"for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement,\" making all users potential experiment subjects. And users know that Facebook's mysterious algorithms control what they see in their News Feed. But it may come as a surprise to users to see those two things combined like this. When universities conduct studies on people, they have to run them by an ethics board first to get approval -- ethics boards that were created because scientists were getting too creepy in their experiments, getting subjects to think they were shocking someone to death in order to study obedience and letting men live with syphilis for study purposes. A 2012 profile of the Facebook data team noted, \"Unlike academic social scientists, Facebook’s employees have a short path from an idea to an experiment on hundreds of millions of people.\" (Update 6/30/14): Cornell University released a statement Monday morning saying its ethics board -- which is supposed to approve any research on human subjects -- passed on reviewing the study because the part involving actual humans was done by Facebook not by the Cornell researcher involved in the study. Though the academic researchers did help design the study -- as noted when it was published -- so this seems a bit disingenuous.","In its initial response to the controversy around the study -- a statement sent to me late Saturday night -- Facebook doesn't seem to really get what people are upset about, focusing on privacy and data use rather than the ethics of emotional manipulation and whether Facebook's TOS lives up to the definition of \"informed consent\" usually required for academic studies like this. \"This research was conducted for a single week in 2012 and none of the data used was associated with a specific person's Facebook account,\" says a Facebook spokesperson. \"We do research to improve our services and to make the content people see on Facebook as relevant and engaging as possible. A big part of this is understanding how people respond to different types of content, whether it's positive or negative in tone, news from friends, or information from pages they follow. We carefully consider what research we do and have a strong internal review process. There is no unnecessary collection of people's data in connection with these research initiatives and all data is stored securely.\"","Ideally, Facebook would have a consent process for willing study participants: a box to check somewhere saying you're okay with being subjected to the occasional random psychological experiment that Facebook's data team cooks up in the name of science. As opposed to the commonplace psychological manipulation cooked up by advertisers trying to sell you stuff.","I'm a privacy pragmatist, writing about the intersection of law, technology, social media and our personal information.

So it’s perhaps no accident it’s chosen today to announce the international rollout of a News Feed tweak it made in the US, back in January, that’s designed to inject more local news into users’ feeds.","The tweak to Facebook’s algorithmic recipe is part of wider efforts to tackle the problem of Facebook’s AIs preferring and promoting ‘low quality’ content — at the expense of users’ eyeballs and even community cohesion.","Divisive, politicized social media messages were the medium used by Kremlin agents to try to disrupt the 2016 US presidential election.","Facebook’s response to this existential threat to its business model is an attempt to surface trusted local news — which it says “helps people connect to their communities about the issues that are closest to home”.","Albeit, as my TC colleague Brian Heater previously noted, there is a parallel risk that “a hyperlocal, decentralized version of Facebook’s news feed could ultimately have the effect of further polarizing sources if not balanced with broader, national news coverage”.","Time will tell how this latest unilateral shift by Facebook will shake out for users, publishers and communities around the world.","“Now, people around the world will see more news on Facebook from local sources covering their current city and other cities they may care about,” writes Alex Hardiman, Facebook’s head of news product, and Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships, announcing the global rollout of the local news tweak.","They add that the update is intended to help boost local publishers who cover “multiple, nearby cities reach audiences in those cities”.","“We’ll consider a publisher as local to multiple cities if the people in those cities are more likely than the people outside of those cities to read articles from the publisher’s domain. By expanding the scope of what may be considered local to people, we’re including other cities that people may care about and connecting people to local publishers from those cities.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Back then, I promiscuously accepted friend requests on the flimsiest of pretenses — which is how I wound up, idiotically, being \"friends\" with direct work supervisors, high school bullies and people I'd briefly dated. Back then, I habitually checked the app so I could update my status anywhere, any time. And though reactions were limited strictly to a simple thumbs up, it didn't stop me from applying it everywhere.","Then, a few years ago, I slashed my friends list in half and I never looked back. My small group now is composed of people I genuinely consider my friends. I don't have a professional public page. I've long since deleted the app, so I don't even think about idly scrolling around when I'm killing time on the go — or enjoying my vacations. I take Lenten breaks, and I post and react less overall. I am deeply concerned about how our privacy is being abused and how false news stories have been disseminated. I have zero doubts that history will not judge Facebook kindly. The current news spin isn't too generous either. Writing for CNBC Sunday, Matt Rosoff observed that 'There's a growing sense that Facebook has become creepy instead of fun . . . . Facebook is facing real problems. Instead of giving answers to those problems, top execs are selling, spinning and staying silent.\"","Yet I can't join the chorus boasting on Twitter (which is definitely totally pure and unproblematic, right?) about deleting my Facebook account. I can't easily walk away from a platform that has been such a powerful tool for rallying community when it's needed.","I have a friend who keeps a Facebook group to share updates — including the frustrating, scary ones — on her cancer treatment. She gets emotional support and can ask for specific advice and help — and she doesn't have to do it one person at a time when her energy is already deeply in flux. Another friend planned her Facebook afterlife while she was in the late stage of her disease, asking me to manage her memorial page. The morning she passed, I was able to share the news, along with a request for a modest period of privacy for the family, without that difficult burden of telling the world going to her grieving relatives. An elderly pal uses it to keep in touch with her modest pool of contemporaries. A group of neighbors use it to keep tabs on local noise and crime — a few months ago we were able to compare notes on a person taking creepshots around our park. And when my family and I have faced our own multiple life and death crises, I've been sobbingly grateful to just be able to type a quick note saying that it's all hit the fan and we need food and babysitting ASAP.","Other friends, admittedly mostly culled from my own white, Gen X demographic, have similarly tenuous relationships with the platform. \"I don't think anything would make me quit Facebook, though I do focus more on messenger these days than actual Facebook,\" a coworker said Monday. \"I'm part of a large network of writers on Facebook, people who are also my best friends, and that's the primary way I keep up with them.\"","There was a time I briefly thought of Facebook as my home. Now I see it more as a good room in a sketchy part of town. Sometimes, I still want to go there and observe the view. Sometimes, I want to share the space with someone I love. But I definitely don't live there and I never will again. I can't get back what's already been taken from us, without our knowledge, but I can't dismiss the platform's unique usefulness either. So for now, I still just wonder about the devil's bargain two billion of us have made. \"I was fine with giving away my personal data for the purposes of selling me stuff,\" a faraway friend told me Monday. \"I've been sold stuff since the day I was born.

In January, when Facebook announced changes to its newsfeed which it said would hit user engagement in the near term, shares fell 4.5 percent in one day.\n“It’s clear with more ‘heat in the kitchen from the Beltway’ that further modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” said Daniel Ives, research analyst at GBH Insights.\nHe also argued that the issue was “background noise” on which Facebook could calm any regulatory nerves through further investments in security, ad content AI, improved content algorithms and screening mechanisms.\nNo analysts had so far changed their price targets or recommendations on Facebook in response to the reports. Wall Street is largely bullish on the stock with 40 of 44 analysts recommending the stock “buy” or higher.\nShares of the company were down 4.4 percent at $177.90 by 09.13 a.m. ET.

Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","\"The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,\" said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Stamos said in statement Monday, \"These are really challenging issues, and I've had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.\" On Twitter, he said he was \"still fully engaged with my work at Facebook\" and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Stamos' departure.","Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Sandberg, disagreed early on how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Stamos said his relationship with Sandberg was \"productive.\"","Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a \"pretty crazy idea.\"","In the ensuing months, Facebook's security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook's findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine the U.S. election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Stamos said in his statement that \"we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.\"","Related Stories","But Facebook's decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, Facebook had reversed course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the U.S. electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook's revelation was a good first step, \"I'm disappointed it's taken 10 months of raising this issue before they've become much more transparent.\"","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Zuckerberg and Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook's reputation in different countries, said Facebook is \"caught in a Catch-22.\"","\"Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don't want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,\" he said. \"But if they don't, it damages their image.\"","McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company's conduct.","By December 2017, Facebook executives decided to reassign Stamos' team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Stamos has largely been left as Facebook's security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook's representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Stamos tweeted in defense of the company. Facebook's communications staff had to approve Stamos' comments, according to two people briefed on the incident.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","\"I told them, 'Your business is based on trust, and you're losing trust,'\" said McNamee, a founder for the Center for Humane Technology. \"They were treating it as a PR problem, when it's a business problem.

He’d been through the hell of chemo before, and the last thing he wanted was more treatment.","“My dad was really desperate,” Taylor Wilmot, his daughter, told BuzzFeed News. “He was very sad, and he didn’t want to die.”","Then 55 and living alone in Columbus, Georgia, he stumbled across the Facebook group of Jillian Mai Thi Epperly, a woman from Canton, Ohio, whose tens of thousands of followers swore by her bizarre, dangerous, and entirely made-up science theory: that all diseases — including cancer — are caused by a fungus called candida that lives in the gut.","Jamie Jansen","Jillian Mai Thi Epperly","As Epperly claimed on the group — called Exposing the Lies Candida: Weaponized Fungus Mainstreaming Mutancy — candida attracts parasites, and the only way to health is a severely restricted diet accompanied by large quantities of her signature fermented cabbage juice. Her potion was a purgative, and she said that “healing symptoms” included nausea, headaches, dizziness, and explosive blasts of diarrhea. These “waterfalls” supposedly brought out the parasites, which were visible in the toilet bowl.","For Wilmot, things moved swiftly downhill after his diagnosis. The doctor had given him a few weeks, maybe a few months, according to his rabbi, Brian Hawkins, who told BuzzFeed News he was with Wilmot when he was diagnosed. But within just days, Wilmot found it hard to get around, and a hospice facility sent a bed to his duplex.","“I've been juicing like crazy, Cancer bad juice good,” he wrote in a Facebook post on June 13. “Ime [sic] brewing up some of Jillian Mai Thi's protocol and plan on switching completely over to her diet, ferment etc. as soon as that is ready.” Friends wrote comments of encouragement and said they were praying for him.","Epperly, whom Wilmot had tagged, also replied: “You are amazing If you need a short chat later let me know You will pull through.”","“I might take you up on that,” Wilmot said.","A few days later, friends visited his condo to help make a huge batch of the juice. They followed the recipe described in documents posted on Epperly’s Facebook group: Add a tablespoon of pink Himalayan salt to two cups of water and two cups of cabbage or kale. Puree in a blender, pour into a glass jar, cover, and leave at room temperature to ferment for three days. Drink a few cups nightly — up to a gallon a day.","Rabbi Hawkins, who had become Wilmot's religious guide and friend in those final months, remembered hearing about the cabbage juice. \"If someone had bottled up rat poison and told him, ‘It will heal you,’ he would have drunk it,” Hawkins told BuzzFeed News. “That’s how desperate the man was.”","When Taylor came back to visit her father a few weeks later, she was shocked. “He was totally emaciated,” she said. “He was drinking so much of it, he was basically starving himself. It was all coming out as diarrhea.”","In mid-July, Wilmot's friends found him unconscious on the floor of his apartment, and he was moved to a hospice facility. On July 20, about a month after he was diagnosed and began the juice purge, he died.","Facebook is under scrutiny for its outsized role in spreading political misinformation. But it’s also a platform where pseudoscience, snake oil remedies, and medical falsehoods multiply unchecked. Those have received far less attention, despite carrying the potential for immediate physical harm.","There are countless fake science gurus with large Facebook followings. But Epperly’s is particularly striking, according to Tim Caulfield, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Alberta, because she’s not a celebrity. “She isn’t associated with some well-packaged brand, so it’s interesting that she’s able to accumulate this much interest.”","She says her cabbage concoction will reverse illness, arrest aging, and even turn gay people straight.","Epperly is also notable for the stark absurdity of her theory. She says her cabbage concoction will reverse all forms of illness, arrest aging, and even turn gay people straight. These claims are “absolutely dangerous nonsense,” David Seres, director of medical nutrition at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center, told BuzzFeed News. “I am almost speechless.”","Epperly has no background in medicine or science. She delivers elements of her theory in rambling videos beamed live from her home. They have an unvarnished reality-TV quality to them: Epperly is often in a T-shirt, hair up, walking through the house as she talks. She is also a prolific Facebook commenter, each missive a stream-of-consciousness word salad. And for $70 an hour, she told BuzzFeed News, she will provide personal phone consultations, talking people through her theory and how to make the recipe.","When asked why she presents wild theories with no evidence to back them up, Epperly likened her efforts to a religious conversion. She doesn’t worry, she said, about people who don’t believe.","“We’re using a different context in my world, and the manifestations from the salt and the accessing of the nutrients is gonna give you a different context of what the symptoms are,” Epperly said. “So essentially what it is, is we’re trying to turn an atheist into a Christian.”","More than a dozen people told BuzzFeed News that they complained to Facebook about Epperly and her group, to no avail. The company has fairly lax rules for dealing with pseudoscientific groups. “We remove content, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety,” according to its community standards.","For example, in January the platform removed videos promoting the Tide Pod Challenge after people began posting videos eating (or pretending to eat) laundry detergent.","But Epperly’s group did not violate Facebook’s rules, a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, and so was not taken down. The company wants to encourage discussion among its users, the spokesperson added, and does not want to censor provocative ideas. Facebook refused to discuss Wilmot’s death with BuzzFeed News on the record.","Sometimes, perhaps most of the time, Facebook’s relaxed policy means that people making wild health claims — like Joseph Mercola, “Food Babe” Vani Hari, or the makers of the “FasciaBlaster” who injured women with a device that promised to zap cellulite — can thrive. But in Epperly’s case, something unusual happened: Some Facebook users decided to take matters into their own hands.","Motivated in part by Wilmot's death, about a dozen private satellite Facebook groups — the biggest has over 10,000 members — have emerged with the explicit purpose of taking her down. This countermovement has organized to contact journalists, law enforcement, and the Ohio Medical Board about Epperly’s dangerous ideas — and prompted a response from the Ohio Attorney General.","But whether their efforts will make any dent in Epperly’s business — or change Facebook’s stance on enabling fake science — is still very much an open question.","Via JenLeigh5 / Photobucket","Screenshots from Epperly's Facebook group, as collected by her critics.","Epperly lays out her personal history in a 106-page book she self-published on Google Drive. She was born in Vietnam, arrived in the US before she turned 2, and was adopted by American parents.","Growing up in the Bay Area, her father worked in biotech, and she points to this as the source of her insider knowledge that the pharmaceutical industry is a scam. She is against vaccines, and presents an argument that’s common among anti-vaxxers: that Big Pharma is in cahoots with doctors to keep Americans sick and addicted to medication. “I realized that vaccines are just one way to inject pollution into a human body,” she wrote.","After bouncing around for college — Epperly told BuzzFeed News she did not graduate — she helped sell insurance. She developed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Because it kept her away from work once a month, she said, she had a hard time holding down a job.","She met her husband online, then moved to Ohio to live with him. In their first years together he worked as a trucker and she would travel cross-country with him, listening to radio pundits and conspiracy theorists, like InfoWars founder Alex Jones.","“I was exposed to the anti-vaxx community, the chemtrail community,” Epperly said. Looking for alternate ways to treat her PMDD, she said, “I tried every single detox, pill, powder, supplement, that I had access to, and joined millions of groups that were all promoting their wares.”","She also dabbled in fermentation, trying recipes for kombucha and for pickles. At some point, she decided to swap cucumbers for cabbage, and upped the spoons of salt in the brew. That was the genesis for her theory.","In parallel, Epperly said, she was researching various diseases online, and noticed that candida or other fungi were “always a factor.” Some alternative medicine websites claim (falsely) that yeast in the human gut can bloom and overwhelm the body if it is exposed to the wrong food or chemical. Epperly just amped up that idea, implicating the fungus as the ultimate cause of any and all illness.","Epperly made kale and cabbage versions of her Jilly Juice for the first time in October 2016. By January 2017, she was posting video demos on her personal Facebook page, attracting dozens of comments. She said that her fans convinced her to create a private Facebook group, which quickly grew over the next few months to include thousands of people.","Epperly said that the group was something of a laboratory: She’d watch how “the protocol” affected her followers, and based on their responses, she’d update her ideas. For example, a key aspect of her theory — that the fermented cabbage juice expels parasites that live in the digestive system — only came about after she saw people’s photos of their bowel movements.","“I wasn't aware of parasites in the beginning,” she told BuzzFeed News. “The group actually was a research tool, a database tool, to share what they were passing. And I’m like, Oh my god. That’s coming out of you in waterfalls?”","Many foods — sugars, legumes, grains, anything processed, and all meat except chicken — fed the parasites, she said. Constipation did too. Poop and its passing became a pillar of Epperly’s dictum.","“We are in a poop cult,” she joked in one video, and a post on her Facebook page. “You know why? Because we’re realizing that poop is one of the main things that is feeding the candida and the worms and the parasites.”","As her following grew, her theory stretched from the digestive system to sexual preferences. “Is our society ready to accept that gay lesbian and transgender is a mutation of the human body,” she wrote in one post.","When asked to elaborate on this, Epperly told BuzzFeed News by email: “I've had gay people say that their intention is to reverse her health issues but not change their sexual leanings and that is completely fine and they may find that in the process of reversing their health issues it may change their sexual desires so it's all a possibility.”","She was amazed by what she saw: Members posted photos of their toilet bowls like they were trophies. Commenters earnestly read the blobs and streaks like tea leaves, pointing out what they thought were tapeworms, fungi, and parasites, and congratulating the posters on taking steps toward better health. Every few days, Epperly herself would appear via a livestream from her home.","“I started watching people drinking it, and using it as an enema, and giving it to babies and children.”","Burns’ curiosity quickly turned to anger. “I started watching people drinking it, and using it as an enema, and giving it to babies and children,” she said.","In one video a member had posted, Burns said, a toddler drank a concoction of Epperly’s recipe. “I was just like, ‘Are you serious?’”","Burns looked on Facebook for others who shared her alarm, and found a (now-defunct) group called “Exposing the lies of jillian mai thi & her protocol,” in which people railed against Epperly. Burns kept watching posts in Epperly’s group and began documenting developments regularly.","Aeryale Thomas, a 37-year-old from Grand Rapids, Michigan, founded a similar private group, “Death By Salt: Mainstreaming The Mai Thi Experiment,” last year. She told BuzzFeed News that she was also alarmed that kids were consuming the fermented cabbage juice.","“What caught my eye was a parent putting the protocol, the juice, in a feeding tube of a child that was very sick,” she said. “No one was saying, ‘This is a bad idea.’”","Epperly's opponents marked up a screenshot from her Facebook group allegedly showing the diaper of a baby who had been fed the protocol.","Thomas said she messaged the mother, but the woman blocked her and did not respond. Still, Thomas said she felt she had to warn strangers about buying into Epperly’s fake health claims. “I don’t know these people, but it’s still like watching a child get hit by a car,” Thomas said.","Convinced that poorly fermented products could be making people ill, and that the salt content in the mixture was also bad news, Thomas said that she and several other women began screenshotting posts by Epperly and her followers and posting them in their own group.","“I feel compelled to retain this information just in case something does happen and the authorities need some kind of reference, a reference point,” Thomas told BuzzFeed News.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that she believes that infants can benefit from drinking the juice in addition to breast milk. She added that, “a baby could potentially live on this along with coconut oil and be fine, and would be able to flourish and grow because they’re getting access to nutrients.“ (Epperly also claimed that Thomas is a “proponent” of giving pregnant women kratom, a plant with some opioid properties. Thomas told BuzzFeed News that she is in a Facebook group about kratom, and she believes the plant may be a better alternative to painkillers.)","By the fall of last year, when word got out that Bruce Wilmot had died, Epperly addressed the tragedy in a video she posted on her Facebook page. In the video, she claimed that she had spoken to Wilmot about how and when to drink the juice. The reason things went wrong, she explained, was that he didn’t take enough of it.","“He stopped. I told him, cut back a little bit if the symptoms get too much — but he really shouldn’t have. He really should have kept going,” she said.","In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Epperly doubled down on this idea, saying Wilmot had not been “aggressive” enough in following her protocol, and speculating that his death could have also been helped along by his medications, the pineapple juice he drank, or the medical system.","“Nobody looks for my protocol when they are completely 100% well and happy,” she said.","Wilmot’s daughter Taylor watched the video from her home in California a few months after he died. “That really hurt my heart,” she told BuzzFeed News. She found the video after someone had tried to recruit her into the movement to destroy Epperly’s Facebook stronghold. “I was shocked that there was a whole group of people who believed that my dad had died from this,” she said.","She joined several of the opposition groups and wrote a public post describing her dad’s experience. She hoped that people who were thinking about starting Epperly’s protocol would find her note and change their minds.","News of Wilmot’s death enraged Epperly’s critics. By fall, the handful of anti-Epperly groups had multiplied to almost a dozen. (Burns launched her own “anti-juice” splinter group with this stated goal: “We want to take Jillian off Facebook! At least take the children and babies off of this protocol!” It now has more than 420 members.)","“It’s like spy vs. spy,” she said. “I mean, it’s a war of information.”","But Epperly’s group grew too. Ann Kennedy, a 42-year-old from the Columbus suburbs, told BuzzFeed News she joined the group in late 2017, after she saw a friend post about the protocol.","Kennedy had been a dental assistant for a decade and was outraged by the claims. “It was like, whoa, is this real life?” Once in the group, she realized that thousands of people were convinced it was real.","“I joined every anti-Jillian group I could,” Kennedy said. Almost immediately, she was kicked out of Epperly’s group — evidently, Epperly’s followers had covertly joined the opposition forums and spotted her.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that she knows some of her followers joined anti-juice groups to keep tabs on her critics, but said she didn’t ask or pay them to.","“It’s like spy vs. spy,” she said. “I mean, it’s a war of information.”","Bruce Wilmot / Via Facebook","Wilmot's jars of Jilly Juice.","Over the past few months, the thousands-strong anti-Epperly movement — on Facebook and elsewhere — has taken real-world actions against her.","In October, an anonymous author created a (now-private) blog and posted systematic and lengthy takedowns of Epperly’s claims, including annotated screenshots of Facebook posts. In a YouTube library, someone catalogued snippets of Epperly’s Facebook videos — proof of her claims in case she shut down her account. A Change.org petition (with 809 signatures as of February) called for Epperly to be banned from Facebook and all social media. In the private anti-Epperly group “Cabbotaging Children & Pets: Reporting Jillian Mai Thi Epperly,” a Google document listed contact information for state and federal law enforcement, attorneys general, and medical boards.","Another group pooled their screenshots and saved them on the photo-sharing site Photobucket, organized in folders by theme, archived in case Epperly’s Facebook group disappeared. (The person behind that account told BuzzFeed News that she spent 25 hours over two weeks working on it.) Jeff Holiday, a 35-year-old from Oregon who makes YouTube videos skewering scammy science, produced a three-part series on Epperly, racking up about 47,000 views in total.","Andrew Stewart, a 32-year-old from Minnesota, joined Epperly’s group in November, after hearing about it on an anti-vaxx group he was trolling. Between jobs, living alone, with time on his hands, he drafted a letter to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office in late December, requesting that the office consider criminal charges against Epperly.","“I would like to ask that the office of the Ohio Attorney General without delay investigate this matter and use every legal option to make this woman stop, and furthermore consider criminal charges,” he wrote. “She is an inherent threat to the safety of others and what she is doing is neither legal nor by any standard morally sound at all.”","A few days later, the AG’s office replied to Stewart, referring him to the state medical board. Over the next few weeks, Stewart said, he also contacted the State of Ohio Medical Board, the criminal investigations division at the FDA, and Interpol.","“I didn't want her to go somewhere she could be immune to prosecution,” Stewart told BuzzFeed News.","Kennedy, meanwhile, filed a complaint with the Ohio Medical Board, asserting that Epperly was dispensing medical advice without a license.","She also turned her efforts online. “I googled ‘cults,’” she remembered, looking for ways to take down organized groups led by scam artists. She tried a local news station in Ohio, but they didn’t bite. She stopped short of calling the police. “I just couldn’t imagine calling the police department and saying these things,” she said. “I feared that they would want to come find me and take me away.”","According to Epperly, others have gone to more extreme lengths. She said she has received spoofed phone calls that appeared to originate from the police department, or the humane society, or the Ohio AG’s office.","Someone told Facebook that Epperly’s husband was dead, so the company turned his profile into a memorial page. (It has since been turned back.) Once, she said, wings and pizzas arrived at her house from an anonymous sender who hadn’t paid for them.","For $30 annually, or $5 monthly, readers could become part of Epperly’s “growing virtual community.”","Epperly said she decided to turn her group from public to private for the sake of her moderators, who were also receiving messages from the anti-juice crowd by email and on Facebook.","By the new year, Epperly had had enough of her haters. She put her group on lockdown — no one but moderators could make new posts — and trimmed the membership by about 1,000 members, according to a message she shared with the remaining group.","Epperly explained that she would launch an independent website and host her following there instead of Facebook. She said that the group had become too large, and that her trolls had become too much of a nuisance. “I left the platform because I have people being targeted,“ she told BuzzFeed News. “I've actually had people who were visited by [Child Protective Services] and had to get a note from their doctor to allow them to feed their baby or their child this recipe.”","Jillyjuice.com launched on Feb. 5. Epperly wrote on the homepage: “I have a protocol to reverse 100% all of your health issues from A-Z forever vaccinated or not, except for major organ transplant patients and surrogate mothers until they bring the baby to term!!”","For $30 annually, or $5 monthly, readers could become part of Epperly’s “growing virtual community.” She spent the next couple of weeks explaining to the Facebook group which modes of payment she could and couldn’t take (from credit card and bank transfers to checks mailed to a P.O. box in Canton, Ohio) and posting daily reminders that she would be shutting down the 58,000-member page soon.","Not everyone was happy with the move away from Facebook, but Epperly dismissed them. When group members asked if she would keep her website free, she balked.","“I’m not going to put up with somebody sniveling about how they can’t afford to pay for my site which is only $30 a year which is Pennies on the dollar and believe me if people want to know this information they will find a way to move Heaven and Earth and those who snivel and talk about how poor they are they just need to do the recipe and drink and drink,” she wrote.","Via JenLeigh5 / Photobucket","Screenshots, as collected by Epperly's critics, of \"The List\" of rules for people new to her group.","In mid-February, just as Epperly had promised, the Facebook group vanished. She told BuzzFeed News that she purged the group of almost all its members, but keeps the archives so she can see old posts when she wants to.","The move did not seem to deter the anti-juice movement. The week the Facebook group disappeared, Thomas of Michigan launched her own anti-juice website, and also submitted a complaint to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, noting that “jillyjuice.com is soliciting donations for medical advice,” according to the complaint provided to BuzzFeed News by the attorney general.","This time, instead of dismissing the complaint, the AG’s complaint specialist, Anne Davis, told Thomas and Epperly to talk to each other to try to reach an amicable resolution.","Instead, Epperly wrote an email to Davis claiming she was “a victim of internet bullying no different than dealing with a school yard bully.” She explained that she had set up the website and its paywalled forum to ward off such “evil and malicious” attacks. And she repeated her claim that her protocol could “potentially reverse Cancer, disease and chronic illness using liquefied sauerkraut.”","Thomas, meanwhile, asked Epperly in an email to disavow the “healing” and “reversing” claims that she had made, and in particular to stop recommending that people feed the salty fermented brew to children. “There are many people who have done your Protocol, both long-term, and short-term, and have drunk the 'jillyjuice' — only to have had impairment, negative reactions and irreparable harm,” Thomas wrote.","Epperly’s reply landed in her inbox minutes later: “Fuck off.”","Thomas forwarded the exchange to Davis.","About two weeks later, a representative from the agency told BuzzFeed News that the complaint had been closed — and passed on to the FDA.","“Our Consumer Protection Section reviewed the information but felt that another agency (in this case the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) may be in a better position to address the concerns presented in this complaint,” spokesperson Kate Hanson told BuzzFeed News by email.","Kennedy and Stewart received identical responses to their complaints submitted to the Ohio Medical Board. The board told them that the query had been directed to the AG’s office — the same office that had just relinquished responsibility to the FDA. (Stewart said he still hadn’t heard back from the FDA or Interpol.)","Despite the best efforts of thousands of people who banded together to boot out Epperly’s fake science news, it still thrives, dodging agency regulations and platform policies. No one seems to be able, or inclined, to make Epperly stop.","Facebook said the group doesn’t violate its policies. When asked if the Federal Trade Commission was responsible, FTC spokesperson Frank Dorman was unsure: “The FTC enforces the FTC Act against deceptive or unfair business practices, so it’s conceivable, but this might be something for the FDA,” Dorman wrote by email.","FDA spokesperson Peter Cassell told BuzzFeed News that the agency has received “at least two complaints” related to Jilly Juice (not including the two that the Ohio Attorney General passed on). He would not comment on whether the FDA is investigating these complaints.","“Marketing unapproved products that claim to prevent, diagnose, treat or cure cancer without evidence is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective,” Cassell wrote by email.","However, the FDA has not yet determined whether Epperly’s website and videos fall under its purview, since she does not sell a food or drug product.","No one seems to be able, or inclined, to make Epperly stop.","“It blows my mind that no authority will step in and say, hey lady, you need a license. You need to educate yourself properly. You need to not tell parents to give this to their children behind closed doors,” Thomas said.","Meanwhile, Epperly continues to give juice updates to the 5,000-plus followers on her personal Facebook page. Recently, she explained via live video that she had found affirmation for another of her theories: that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer. On her new website, she put up a video claiming that Jilly Juice could possibly prevent autism and obesity in kids.","Much of her Facebook page’s discussion lately has revolved around her upcoming appearance on the Dr. Phil show, where she intends to face her detractors in front of a national television audience. “Let's bring it on baby and I'm only going to go on if I'm allowed to plug my book and my website,” she posted on March 6.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that going on TV will be an opportunity to get it all out in the open. “It’s gonna be like Jerry Springer — I’m gonna have my haters on there. Hopefully there won’t be any chairs thrown at me.” ●"],"isopubdate":""}

If users had not adjusted their privacy settings on the social media outlet, however, the app didn’t just capture the survey responses — it also gathered as much data from each account as possible.","That data included information from Facebook users’ friends and contacts, as well.","\"So by you filling out my survey I capture 300 records on average right,\" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. \"And so that means that, all of a sudden, I only need to engage 50,000, 70,000, 100,000 people to get a really big data set really quickly, and it’s scaled really quickly. We were able to get upwards of 50 million plus Facebook records in the span of a couple of months.\"","Similar stories based on the same reporting also appeared in the New York Times and the Observer of London.","According to Wylie, the project was of particular importance to Steve Bannon, who later served as the chief executive of Trump's campaign. He added that the former head of the right-wing media organization Breitbart wanted to use the data netted by Cambridge Analytica to influence and galvanize the views of the American public.","\"Steve wanted weapons for his culture war, that’s what he wanted,\" Wylie said.","\"We offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do, which was change the culture of America,\" Wylie added.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman refuted all of Wylie's claims, calling his decision to speak to the media \"a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"","\"We were forced to take action against Mr. Christopher Wylie to prevent his misuse of the company's intellectual property and he is the subject of restraining undertakings in this regard,\" the spokesman said. \"It is clear that he has a grudge to bear and appears set on trying to damage the company.\"","But Wylie said in the initial interview that this wasn’t about getting back at Cambridge Analytica, noting that \"if it was about revenge I could have done this years ago.\"","Instead, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of research calls his whistleblowing a crisis of conscience.","\"It weighs on me that I played a pivotal role in setting up a company that I think has done a lot of harm to the democratic process in a lot of countries,\" Wylie said.","The idea behind the project was that political preferences can be predicted by personal details people voluntarily provide on their social media accounts. By analyzing the details that users share online, Cambridge Analytica could predict individual behavior, which included voter preferences and how to influence that preference.","CEO of Cambridge Analytica Alexander Nix speaks at the 2016 Concordia Summit - Day 1 at the Grand Hyatt New York on Sep. 19, 2016 in New York City.Bryan Bedder / Getty Images for Concordia Summit","\"Whenever you go and you like something you are giving me a clue as to who you are as a person,\" Wylie said. \"And so all of this can be captured very easily and run through an algorithm that learns who you are.\"","Wylie said that \"almost none\" of the people whose profiles were tapped were aware that Cambridge Analytica had harvested their data.","The research all began in 2013 at Cambridge University, according to ITN Channel 4 News, where the university's psychometrics center began to examine the psychology behind Facebook and what information could be gleaned by pulling the data from user profiles.","According to Wylie, Bannon hoped to use that research and replicate it on a massive scale across the American electorate to buoy his influence campaign in 2014 and again in the 2016 presidential campaign. Billionaire Republican donors Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebecca — who own a portion of Cambridge Analytica — put Bannon in contact with the founder of the method, Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan, ITN Channel 4 News.","\"Kogan didn’t make any money off of it, he didn't,\" Wylie said. \"He did it for free, and what he got out of it was the giant data set and what [Cambridge Analytica] got out of it was also data, everyone got data. But Cambridge Analytica paid for it directly.\"","Cambridge Analytica appeared to lay the blame on Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), which is not associated with Cambridge University.","\"This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement issued Saturday.","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" the statement added.","According to ITN Channel 4 News, Kogan said he held the right to use the data for commercial purposes and did nothing wrong.","Meanwhile, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million to help target voters. The company told NBC News mere days before the 2016 election that it held data on 230 million American adults with approximately 4,000 “data points” on each of them.","The company denied, however, using any data that was harvested from Facebook via Kogan’s methods to help the Trump campaign.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the company added in Saturday's statement.","Facebook said in a statement that \"Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook.\" The social media provider added that Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan had told the company that all the data initially obtained by the app had been destroyed.","\"In light of new reports that the data was not destroyed, we are suspending these three parties from Facebook, pending further information,\" Facebook said. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties.\"","The social media company also insists that this did not constitute a data breach, as users technically consented — via their privacy settings — to allow Cambridge Analytica to harvest their data.","But Wylie does not think Facebook is completely innocent, as the social media giant first knew of the data gathering in 2015.","\"Why Facebook didn't, you know, make more enquiries when they started seeing that, you know, tens of millions of records were being pulled this way? I don’t know you’d have to ask Facebook that,\" Wylie said. \"But Facebook at least in a technical sense facilitated the project because they had applications that had these permissions in the first place.\"","According to Wylie, Facebook never checked that they had deleted the data, only requiring that Cambridge Analytica fill out a form.","And thanks to the lack of oversight, this influence-peddling company was able to \"move into the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before.\"","And they did it in a way that entered a more than ethical grey area, according to Wylie, who claims they attempted to manipulate voters by latching onto their vulnerabilities.","\"This gets at the heart of, you know, why is it that you’re taking this psychological approach?\" he said. \"Why is it that you need to study things like shame proneness in people? Why do you need to, you know, study neuroticism in people? What’s going to make them fearful?\"","CORRECTION (March 17, 2018, 7:50 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the position Steve Bannon held in the Trump campaign.

Which company seeks the convenience of machine intelligence and data analytics at the same time as wanting to protect users from abuse of their private information? Apple,” Evans writes. “Apple’s devices already possess more power than most. The company just needs to tie them all together.”","We’re interested to see if Apple can really capitalize on their commitment to privacy or if it’ll take a major breach to wake up the majority of people or if even that would be enough to make privacy a real selling point.","Given how many gullible and/or ignorant people are willing to hand over their personal data for free to the likes of Google and Facebook (while mailing their DNA to other companies, no less), we’re not seeing Apple’s devotion to privacy as very salable versus the extra capabilities of other personal assistant from companies that wipe their feet on user privacy every second of the day.","I disagree in general that a conscience is a bad trait for a CEO or for a corporation. If Citizens United has made corporations people, let’s assign to them all of the responsibilities that govern people. And I certainly would not want to work for a corporation whose CEO has no social conscience!","But in Apple’s case, I agree with you. They already had a social network, eWorld, back in the late nineties. It was HORRIBLE. They censored private chatrooms and would boot users for saying “Damn.” Seriously. It was the Disneyland “It’s a Small World” ride of social networking sites.","I understand, you would prefer a Fox and Friends social site. I thought that you were a champion of freedom, hansomesmitty. Freedom of speech. Freedom of expression. Individual rights. If people make ill-advised choices to join a given social network, well, that is a manifestation of that freedom. The thought kind of makes me ill, but sometimes that is what a democracy does to a person.","You are free to develop a conservative social media site that promotes all kinds of ideas, from the pragmatic to the ridiculous. You complain all of the time that the free press and most everything else is left-leaning, so start your own social network lorded over by your conscience.","for me, the most unsettling thing about facebook are the friends. friends i’ll never know. friends i’ll never talk with. friends i’ll never touch. friends around whom my arms will never encircle. friends whose voice i’ll never hear. whose house i’ll never enter. a six letter noun so diluted i’m no longer sure i remember what a real friend really means. other than that, it is, at times, a useful tool.","i do have a fb account but use very little. i don’t accept friend requests, though, daily, facebook floods my fb and email accounts with new friend suggestions and i have no idea how they make the connections to these strangers. that’s the least of it to be sure. when logged in i feel less like ms social than i feel like a mark","From your prior post it sure sounded like you had a lot of ‘friends’ in your FB profile since you complained about it so vehemently. Like any tool use it properly and you’ll get the benefits that ‘suit’ you. 🙂 Hard to complain about a hammer if you use it to hit your thumb more often than the nail.","my current fb account is my second. the first i deleted along with friends, posts, photos. as a utility, i think it’s a fine tool. i think you misunderstand my initial post.","if you stockpile friends as facebook encourages, your wall becomes a cascade of strange, dissociated personal drivel punctuated by an occasional proverb. instead of one creating content, actively engaging, one may easily get hypnotized by the flow of detritus in one’s own gutter and give more and more attention to the community as a witness, and to the ads.","i’m a very emotional person. my world is full of emotion. my friends i love to touch, kiss, throw my arms around. facebook by facebook’s rules can become desperately shallow. i was naive. i was spellbound with my first account. now, with my second, i know better. it’s just a tool.","Agreed with your comment. I would just add that Apple’s ‘Find my friends’ IS their social networking service. I would venture to say that if your going to allow anyone to track your whereabouts, like this app does, your likely actually interacting with them, routinely see them face to face, and would likely attend an event with them, and just basically give a damn about them, as opposed to the nitwits following each other like dim witted sheep on Facebook and Twitter.","” or if even that would be enough to make privacy a real selling point.”","You’re already sold out if privacy is your selling point!","Heck, you’re already in bed with Google (very profitably) and somehow “magically” that’s not selling out. Yet the assumption that “Apple won’t sell out our privacy” remains. That is the “magic” of spin.","Many Apple users already defend single store censorship as a feature, for the sake of security.","Big investors don’t care how a company makes money. It has nothing to do with morality and everything to do with how much money they can make. Apple is the only major tech company that doesn’t data mine and also has the lowest P/E because of Tim Cook wanting to preserve consumer privacy. Apple is never praised by Wall Street for protecting consumer privacy. In fact, Apple is the only major tech company on the doomed list for not harvesting user data.","I contend that Apple has a relatively poor P/E ratio because Apple is highly obtuse in its financial reporting. Don’t let investors know that you have a plan while it is obvious many product lines are dying on the vine, and you will rapidly lose trust.","Also, Apple does data mine just as much as any other tech company. The difference is that Apple claims to anonymize the data (a lie) and not sell it to other companies (also now questionable since the new Apple business model is subscription model, which means constant analytic data will go to content creators).","For you to believe, without proof, that Apple keeps your data entirely private and secure is an act of faith. It’s not in the user agreement.","What people seem to forget is that FaceBook, MySpace, MAcDailyNews, Reddit, Gmail, whatever, is somebody else’s living room! It”s their house and their rules. You are allowed in as their guest. If their rule is that you give them your ID at the door, then either accept it or don’t go in or use the ID without your essential info. Facebook had it’s good points, meeting remote family members, reconnecting with distant friends, making new acquaintances, learning a few helpful things. That misinformation and hysteria prevailed, probably because it was profitable to FaceBook’s advertising model (I don’t believe for an instant their excuse that fake news jpeg memes are not readable to their search algorithms), makes FaceBook a distasteful place.","What would an Apple social network achieve? Well, I for one already have places (here for example) where I can interact with other Apple users so that’s not helpful. I assume that most PC people wouldn’t want to join an Apple branded network initially and anything that Apple would moderate (it the full sense of the word moderate) would bring out the wailing ninnies against “Apple conformity”."],"isopubdate":""}

The quiz — \"thisisyourdigitallife\" — in turn pulled data from their friends' profiles as well, ending in the enormous data stash.","What data did they get?","Cambridge Analytica harvested personal information on where users lived and what pages they liked, which helped build psychological profiles that analysed characteristics and personality traits.","This kind of information was later deployed in political campaigns.","Wylie said: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles.

He said that the so-called psychography profiles combined Facebook data with information gathered from other \"top commercial data providers\" and that data included specific information about voter \"demographics, geographics, purchase history and interests.\"","When a Facebook user engaged with the survey, he said, the user implicitly gave the company access to a broad spectrum of personal data that Facebook provides for advertisers. The app reached further, giving the company access to profile data from people in the users' broader circle of Facebook friends who had, wittingly or otherwise, set their security setting relatively weakly. Though the company likely did not use a traditional \"hack\" to access user information, they may have violated Facebook's terms of use by bulk harvesting and repurposing user data.","When asked about how the company chose what to include in Facebook surveys, Oczkowski would only say that it collects data from \"exclusive relationships\" with data vendors \"and through direct response projects.\"","Cambridge Analytica pushed back Saturday against the notion that it harvested any data, insisting it had contracted a firm in the U.K. to do research. Cambridge Analytica insisted that when it learned that it had been sold data it shouldn't have, the firm deleted the data.","Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don't use or hold any Facebook data. 1/8","\"Inner Demons\"Getting users to interact with the survey was key to unlocking the data. A source close to the 2016 Trump campaign and familiar with Cambridge Analytica's tactics explained that the surveys used by the company used inflammatory language designed to provoke the \"worst tendencies\" in Facebook users -- meaning that it would stir up the kind of emotion that would prompt an interaction. Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the campaign. Mr. Trump's 2016 digital guru, Brad Parscale, told \"60 Minutes\" last year that the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's controversial practice of psychographics.","Cambridge Analytica specializes in psychographics, which micro targets ads based on personality. In the words of whistleblower Christopher Wylie: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons.\"","That allowed the company to scale up their data gathering rapidly. Wired reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday that by convincing 270,000 people to interact with the app, GSR managed to tap into the data of over 50 million users.","CEO Alexander Nix described the firm as \"fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" and even tweeted Saturday that President Obama's 2012 \"pioneered microtargeting.\"","But Oczkowski contradicted that assertion, and explained that \"we served as the data agency of record, but our role quickly evolved as the cycle progressed.\"","The company developed \"three pillars\" of exclusive technology, Oczkowski said, including data science and analytics, digital marketing designed for persuasion and get-out-the-vote (GOTV), and polling research. \"Having a large amount of control and input into each of these three areas allowed us to be extremely efficient and reactive,\" he said. \"It also allowed us to easily integrate with the staff at Giles-Parscale and the RNC.\"","When asked specifically how the company leveraged Facebook for other data, Oczkowski explained that the company's data analytics prowess assisted the Trump campaign for everything from resource allocation, calculating the most efficient candidate travel stops, advertising, and the language used in surrogate speeches, and even \"personalizing messaging to the individual voter.\"","\"Huge exaggeration\"Within GOP data circles, however, the company's extravagant claims about the effectiveness of Facebook data and artificial intelligence are heavily criticized. \"I'm not saying they lied,\" said a former Trumpworld staffer shortly after the election, \"but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration. Data can do a lot of things, but there's a limit to how effective it is. Cambridge Analytica's claims went far beyond that limit.\"","Cambridge Analytica is not alone in their use of Facebook and social media to target consumers with advertising. Machine learning is one of the fastest growing sectors of business technology, and a number of firms have adopted similar tactics. Amazon, Google, Twitter, and a host of other cloud-based Internet giants are hiring AI experts and building algorithms that automate advertising.","It's no surprise that cloud giants are actively using big data analysis models to aid private industry in everything from cybersecurity to marketing.

He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that.","But Chris Hoofnagle, faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, said that legal language in the consent decree would make it difficult for the government to show that Facebook had violated the agreement, because it allows Facebook to give the information of a user’s friends to third-party developers.","“The consent decree doesn’t give the FTC a lot of traction, but what’s going to happen is what happened in the first FTC case,” Hoofnagle said, referring to the investigation that resulted in the 2011 agreement. “The FTC went in investigating A, then discovered B, C, D, E, F and G.

(Zach Gibson / Getty Images)","Instead, Axios' Jonathan Swan reports, the tech behemoth Trump wants to go after is Amazon, according to five sources who’ve discussed it with him.","“He’s obsessed with Amazon,” a source said. “Obsessed.”","What we're hearing: Trump has talked about changing Amazon’s tax treatment because he’s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.","A source who’s spoken to POTUS: “He’s wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.\"","Trump’s deep-seated antipathy toward Amazon surfaces when discussing tax policy and antitrust cases. The president would love to clip CEO Jeff Bezos’ wings. But he doesn’t have a plan to make that happen.","Behind the president's thinking: Trump's wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.","Trump tells people Amazon has gotten a free ride from taxpayers and cushy treatment from the U.S. Postal Service.","“The whole post office thing, that's very much a perception he has,” another source said. “It's been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.\"","Axios' Ina Fried notes: The post office actually added delivery on Sunday in some cities because Amazon made it worthwhile.","Trump also pays close attention to the Amazon founder's ownership of The Washington Post, which the president views as Bezos’ political weapon.","Trump never talks about Mark Zuckerberg or Facebook: He isn’t tuned in to the debate over how they handle people’s data, and thinks the Russia story is a hoax, sources say.","Axios' Kim Hart points out: Trump has said he doesn’t mind Facebook because it helps him reach his audience. He's an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores. It reminds me of the story Jim wrote about Trump’s fixation with 1950s life. Amazon takes direct aim at some of the core components of mid-century business.","One warning sign for Facebook: Vice President Mike Pence is concerned about Facebook and Google, according to a source with direct knowledge.","Though Pence isn't yet pushing internally for any specific regulations, he argues these companies are dangerously powerful.","The source said the V.P. worries about their influence on media coverage, as well as their control of the advertising industry and users’ personal info.","When private discussions have turned to the idea of busting Facebook and Google, Pence has listened with keen interest and is open to the suggestion that these two companies need shaking up.","2. Trump’s land of make-believe","President Trump often gets agitated — and stirred to action — by random things he hears on TV or from shoot-the-bull conversations with friends.","It drives staff nuts because they are responding to things that are either inaccurate, highly distorted or flat-out don't exist.","Exhibit 1: The post office example from item above","Exhibit 2: \"Per two senior administration officials, Trump continued to rail privately about the omnibus bill, and has become convinced of things that aren’t true about it,\" the N.Y. Times' Maggie Haberman tweeted yesterday.","3. Who's gonna pay for the wall? Surprise!","\"Ryan offered little ­reaction to the idea ... [S]enior Capitol Hill officials later said it was an unlikely prospect.\"","\"Trump has told advisers that he was spurned in a large spending bill last week when lawmakers appropriated only $1.6 billion for the border wall.\"","\"He has suggested to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ... that the Pentagon could fund the sprawling project, citing a 'national security' risk.\"","Be smart: Trump has to think of something. Some top alumni of his campaign think that the wall was such a centerpiece promise, it's the one issue the base might desert over. So Trump has to come up with some plausible \"wall\" by 2020.","4. Stunning pic","Ammar Al Bushy / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images","Drone footage from Syria shows the wreckage of the town of Arbin, which has been under siege by the Assad regime, just half an hour outside the capital of Damascus, which is believed to be the world’s oldest continuously inhabited city.","5. Dems fear immigrants will skip 2020 census","\"At least 12 states signaled ... that they would sue to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, arguing that the change would cause fewer Americans to be counted and violate the Constitution,\" the N.Y. Times reports:","Why it matters: The question could discourage immigrant participation.","\"The Constitution requires that every resident of the United States be counted in a decennial census, whether or not they are citizens.\"","\"The results are used not just to redraw political boundaries from school boards to House seats, but to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and subsidies.\"","The 12 states: \"The New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said he was leading a multistate lawsuit to stop the move, and officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington said they would join the effort. The State of California filed a separate lawsuit.\"","6. Exodus of U.S. tech workers to Canada","Illustration: Rebecca Zisser / Axios","Tech companies in and around Toronto have seen a surge in international job applications over the last year, by far mostly from the U.S., according to a survey by the tech hub MaRS, Axios future editor Steve LeVine writes:","The number doubled and tripled in some of the companies, the result of a deliberate Canadian campaign to attract tech workers from the U.S. and around the world.","Why it matters: The spike in applications and hiring adds to the evidence suggesting that Trump's immigration crackdown is resulting in a loss of tech workers to Canada.","8. Tim Cook takes road show to Chicago school","The audience records the \"reveal\" of the new iPad during an Apple event in Chicago. (AP's Charles Rex Arbogast)","\"Chicago public schools are on spring break this week, but one company has the power to draw some students back to the classroom,\" per the Chicago Tribune:","\"Apple held a product launch ... at Lane Tech High School, ... announcing a new iPad with a slew of software and features that cater to students.\"","Challenging Google's hold on the classroom, Apple \"announced tools for teachers to better manage their assignments ... and a new curriculum to integrate skills like music, photography and drawing into lesson plans.\"","The entry-level, 9.7-inch iPad will sell for $329 to consumers and for $299 to schools.","9.

Now it turns out that much of that data was obtained fraudulently.","The firm “harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission,” according to a major New York Times investigation published Saturday, “making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.”","Cambridge Analytica, which is backed by billionaire conservative donor Robert Mercer and has former Trump strategist Steve Bannon on its board, is already under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible connections to Russian interference in the election. It’s also under investigation by the UK Parliament for potential violations of data privacy and claims it did illegal work for the pro-Brexit campaign.","Now Facebook VP and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal has accused the firm of running “a scam and a fraud,” as he described it to the New York Times.","Advertisement","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” Grewal, a former federal judge, explained in his statement.","Moreover, when Facebook learned in 2015 that Kogan, a Russian-American academic, had broken their rules, “we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","But that certification appears to have been a lie. The Times reported Saturday: “Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.” It added that “copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control,” but the paper was able to view “a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.”","The bottom line of the Times investigation, which it conducted with The Observer of London, is chilling: The data theft “allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate” for the purposes of electing the Trump campaign, which paid the firm millions of dollars in the last several months of the 2016 campaign.","Not only was that data used for microtargeting voters, but by tracking the response to those messages in real time on social media, the firm could advise the campaign where Trump should visit and what words would resonate most with voters in the region.","Advertisement","In fact, Breitbart executive board chair Steve Bannon, who became CEO of the Trump campaign in mid-August 2016, told Bloomberg in late October of that year, “I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine. Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power.”","The Facebook statement and New York Times investigations add important new information in our understanding of the shady role Cambridge Analytica played in the campaign. We also know that disgraced former national security advisor Michael Flynn had been an advisor to the firm, and as the Wall Street Journal reported in October, its CEO Alexander Nix had “reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing,”","The full story of Cambridge’s role is unlikely to be known until Robert Mueller finishes his investigation."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","News reports now suggest that contrary to prior representations, Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Jared Kushner to run Trump’s data operation, had contacts with Russians, specifically a Russian energy firm. (“Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed ‘micro-targeting’ individuals on social media during elections.”)","Cambridge Analytica was also the subject of a Wall Street Journal report, which found that “the chief executive of a data-analytics firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing, according to a person familiar with the effort. The outreach by the CEO of the firm, which is partly owned by a major Trump donor and has close ties to a Trump adviser, came as Mr. Trump was publicly cheering the leaks of his Democratic rival’s emails and some supporters were seeking to unearth further messages.” And one more nugget: None other than Michael Flynn had an “advisory role” with a firm linked to Cambridge Analytica.","Maybe this is all coincidence. Perhaps Cambridge Analytica has no role whatsoever in providing guidance or data to Russians seeking to manipulate the U.S. election. Perhaps Facebook was an entirely innocent player, hoodwinked by Cambridge Analytica (which was recently suspended from the platform), and had no idea that all this data was being sourced to aid in foreign manipulation of our election. However, at this point, Congress and the American people have considerable reason to doubt those conclusions.","Congress needs to get executives from Facebook (Zuckerberg himself) and Cambridge Analytica up to the Hill promptly to get answers from both firms. The public needs to know:","What was the extent of contacts between Cambridge Analytica and Russian officials?","Did Cambridge Analytica help guide the Russian social media operation by, for example, targeting specific users?","What information did Kushner have, if any, about Cambridge Analytica’s operation and its use of Facebook data?","What did Facebook know about Cambridge Analytica’s operation, when did it know it, and has it been candid and forthcoming in its disclosures?","Answers to these questions are critical not only to the Russia investigation but also to the future of social media platforms. The stakes are obviously high for Facebook, especially if it (intentionally or not) provided more of a boost to Trump’s victory than previously acknowledged. As intelligence analyst Malcolm Nance put it, “What happens if 100s of millions of progressives worldwide abandon Facebook because they think it’s a tool of Trump, Russia authoritarians and neo-Nazis? Facebook needs to own up and do damage control to ensure they are not 2018’s information cruise missile of choice.” Even if it never intended to bolster Trump, it’s hard to disagree that it was lax in recognizing manipulation of its platform and in disclosing the extent of the misuse of users’ data. “What’s clear is that Facebook has built up a massive intelligence tool that can be exploited by foreign actors who don’t care at all if they are violating Facebook’s user agreements,” remarks Max Bergmann, who heads the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress. “This incident demonstrates that it is time for Washington to get serious about regulating the tech companies. They’ve been living in a libertarian fantasy world of ‘don’t be evil’ but that doesn’t work when you have a fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders to prioritize profits.”","Facebook’s conduct during and after the 2016 election may well lead to federal regulation of social media of the type Klobuchar, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) are sponsoring, which would require archiving of political ads with detailed information regarding “a description of the audience the advertisement targets, the number of views generated, the dates and times of publication, the rates charged, and the contact information of the purchaser” and also subject online ads to the same campaign regulations that govern TV and radio ads.","At this point, it is increasingly hard to argue against such regulation, given the cavalier conduct of Facebook and the obvious opportunities for abuse by malicious foreign governments.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Companies like Facebook sell (or buy) your data to third parties, while ones like Google use your data to...Read More to advertisers?” you might be asking. Yes, it does. But there’s an important distinction that many people don’t realize: right now, the information that Facebook sells to advertisers has to do with your activity on Facebook: pages you like, people you follow, apps you connect, and so on. Until now, Facebook hasn’t sold any of the data it collects about your browsing outside of Facebook.","But that’s about to change: in an announcement on June 12, Facebook announced that it would begin selling users’ browsing data directly to advertisers, and that it would roll out new ads over the following weeks, meaning that soon you’ll see more targeted ads on Facebook, and advertisers will know even more about your and your habits, supposedly because when asking users about how ads can be improved, they said “they want to see ads that are more relevant to their interests.” (newsroom.fb.com)","Why Is This A Big Deal?","Because Facebook has always been collecting and selling data, it might not seem like a major issue that they’re now selling browsing information directly to advertisers. But this could signal a big shift in how Facebook interacts with its users and their data.","The fact that Facebook is acting directly in contradiction to these requests in spite of public opinion shows a brazenness that some people weren’t expecting, and it creates some serious worries for privacy in the future. It’s not difficult to imagine Facebook continuing to gather more information and sell it to advertisers.","We have to ask ourselves when we will take action: when Facebook starts listening to our conversations through our cell phones and serving ads based on the products we talk about? When it starts using our webcams to see which brands of clothing we wear? These might seem far-fetched, but so did tracking a user’s every move online and selling the records to advertisers, just a few years ago.","In addition to the higher-level privacy concerns, there’s the “creepy” factor. A lot of people find it unnerving and creepy when they see ads on Facebook for things that they were just looking at on another site. And while Facebook claims that increased ad targeting is something that users are asking for, I haven’t seen any proof of this yet. (If you’re on either side of this particular argument, please leave a comment—I’d love to get a feel for how MakeUseOf readers feel about this issue.)","Why Does Facebook Have My Browsing History?","In short, because Facebook is ubiquitous across the web. Especially when you stay logged in, which most people probably do. If you’re on a page with a “Like” button, Facebook knows that you’re on that page, even if you don’t click that button—Facebook’s terms of service state that it can capture browsing information from these sites and use it for “security purposes” and to deliver ads.","What Can I Do?","Although they haven’t made it easy, Facebook has offered an opt-out of this “service.” To find it, you’ll have to go to the Digital Advertising Alliance website and add Facebook to the list of companies that you don’t want customizing your ads (you can proceed directly to the Choices page to make this update). Make sure that any cookie-blocking software is disabled when you do this.","While you’re there, you might want to select a number of the other companies that are collecting and using your data to serve ads.","Unfortunately, the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out isn’t known for being particularly effective, and your opt-out choices could potentially be lost when you clear your browsing data (or switch to another browser). So you might want to bookmark that page and check it regularly.","If you use the Facebook mobile app, you’ll have to take a few additional steps, as well. On iOS, open up the settings and go to General > Restrictions > Advertising and hit the switch for Limit Ad Tracking. In Android, you’ll have to go to Google Settings > Ads and select Opt out of interest-based ads.","Remember that just because you’re not allowing Facebook to use your browsing data to customize your ads doesn’t mean that they’re not collecting that data: they still have an eye on you, and they’re keeping a lot of data stored somewhere.","What do you think about this move by Facebook? Does it upset you? Are you happy that you’ll be seeing more targeted ads? Do you feel that it’s a violation of your privacy? Share your thoughts below—I’d really like to hear what you think!","I'm sorry, I think I'm missing the problem here... They're using our information to try to sell us products that we have complete control over if we buy or not. I would understand the outrage if they were blackmailing individuals or doing something nefarious to selected groups of people but it looks like they are just making advertisers pay for us to use Facebook. Can someone explain to me where the problem is? I don't think they care about our naughty preferences or watching us sit on the couch watching TV.","WOW! thank you for this article because I thought it was eerie feeling when ads for the stuff I was just browsing for appear on the side of my fb. i always sign out and will look into the proposed strategies. Do they sell our info from other apps they own such as IG","To be fair, none of it should really be news to anyone. Facebook is a billion dollar company who never charged you for using it. The money has to come from somewhere and nobody would invest into FB if they didn't get a dime out of it.","I just took a look at the current Data Use Policy of FB and it's interesting how the put stuff in there that actually allows a snowball effect:\n\"(Affiliates) We may share information we receive with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Facebook is part of, or that become part of that group (often these companies are called affiliates).\"","\"(Service Providers) In some cases we provide the service jointly with another company, such as the Facebook Marketplace. In all of these cases our partners must agree to only use your information consistent with the agreement we enter into with them, as well as this Data Use Policy.\"","So basically Facebook will share data with their close partners, those partners being bound to the same Data Use Policy are allowed to further share your information with their close partners.","I think a large proportion of people won't be surprised to hear this, but a lot of people just don't think about it, and might be taken aback by the level of detail that Facebook can share with ad providers. Either way, it's good for people to know exactly what sort of information is being collected and sold.","No problem. I do like the article and hope it will remind people about the other side of social networks and the data mining happening on the internet.","It's actually one argument I always make on the government surveillance uproar - Gov vs. FB and it's unknown depth of partners... how can one be against one but ok with the other? But that's a totally different topic.","It is difficult to differentiate between corporate surveillance and government surveillance. In fact, the two are often the same, I think. When we're okay with companies using our data, we leave the door open to government subpoena of that information.","That's a tough issue, because companies often make it valuable for us to share our information with them. I use grocery-store loyalty cards, for example—so they're tracking where I'm shopping and what I'm buying and extrapolating information from that. If the government decides to pressure Waitrose or Tesco to turn over their data, then that's in their hands.","These are definitely two viable strategies for dealing with these issues. I think I read something recently about how signing out of Facebook won't completely keep them from tracking you, but I don't remember where I saw it; I'll have ot see if I can find it again.","Dann is a freelance business and technology writer.

In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor.

Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data.

He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by Guardian News & Media and is editorially independent."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"http://datacenterfrontier.com/facebook-boost","title":"Facebook Boosts Mojo for Hot Atlanta Data Center Market","text":["Atlanta has emerged as the hot new destination for data centers. This week’s announcement that Facebook will build a $750 million data center in Newton County adds some hyperscale heat to the rising profile of the Atlanta region, which is already seeing new projects from providers targeting the enterprise market, as well as a healthy stream of sale-leaseback transactions.","“Atlanta is the central hub of business and connectivity for the entire Southeast, which is the fastest-growing region in the country,” said Dallas Whitaker, Chief Portfolio Manager for Carter Validus Mission-Critical REIT, which has a long history operating data centers in the Atlanta market. “I can’t think of anything that will impede that growth.”","The Facebook data center is the third huge campus announced in the region over the past year. In May 2017 Switch announced plans to invest $2.5 billion to build more than 1 million square feet of data center space in Douglas County. In December, Cyrus One confirmed plans to build a 44-acre campus in the Atlanta suburb of Douglasville, that will house 440,000 square feet of data center space.","The arrival of Facebook, CyrusOne and Switch signals growing confidence that Atlanta can now support wholesale data centers, and even hyperscale players. The Atlanta market was the focus of a panel discussion at the recent CAPRE Data Center Market Forecast event in Ashburn, Virginia.","The panelists expressed broad agreement that Atlanta is an ascendant market, and will see more demand for data center space. But the extent of the building boom in Atlanta has some industry veterans keeping a watchful eye on supply and demand. The Atlanta market historically has seen annual absorption rates of 6 to 10 megawatts (MWs) of data center space, compared to between 20 and 60 MWs for markets like Chicago, Dallas, Silicon Valley and Phoenix, and more than 100 MWs for Northern Virginia.","Reaching Beyond Atlanta","The trend line is moving higher, as Atlanta saw 13 MWs of space leased in 2017, up from 7 MWs in 2016, according to data from Jones LangLaSalle. UPDATE: That number will be higher for 2018, as in mid-March QTS Data Centers announced that it had signed lease renewals representing 19 MWs of capacity at its Atlanta-Metro data center.","One reason for optimism is that Atlanta is increasingly a regional market, attracting both local businesses and companies from elsewhere in the U.S.","“I think what we’ve seen in the last few years is out-of-market companies choosing Atlanta for their data center,” said Bob Kramlich, VP of Enterprise Services at T5 Data Centers, which operates a data center in Alpharetta, and recently announced plans for a $100 million facility in Lithia Springs in the city’s Western suburbs.","Indeed, the new players entering the market see Atlanta as a regional hub, and not a local market. Switch sees the potential for a similar dynamic to its hugely successful Las Vegas campus.","“Ninety five percent of our customers are from outside Las Vegas,” said Missy Young, the Chief Information Officer for Switch. “A lot of them are from California. The Southeast corner of the U.S. has roughly the same population as the state of California. We’re here to do business with 40 million people and their companies.”","Free Resource from Data Center Frontier White Paper Library","Over the last several years, “edge computing” has become one of the most talked about trends in IT, and for good reason. Nearly every industry is recognizing the limitations of supporting users and emerging technologies through centralized IT infrastructures and is pushing storage and computing closer to users and devices. Download the new white paper from Vertiv to learn more about edge computing and the four edge archetypes the company has identified.","CyrusOne Chief Technology Officer Kevin Timmons is bullish on the potential for the Atlanta market.","“It’s not hard to imagine Atlanta following in the footsteps of Northern Virginia,” said Timmons. “The fill rates for current data centers are very strong. There’s obviously a need, and I think there hasn’t been a product like ours in that market. We think someday Atlanta will be secondary to only the Northern Virginia market.”","Active Year for M&A, Expansion in 2017","The leading incumbent in the Atlanta market is QTS Data Centers, which operates a 1 million square foot data center in downtown Atlanta, as well as a facility in the suburbs in Suwannee.","The activity in Atlanta made for a busy 2017, in which existing players added capacity, and others entered the market through acquisitions and sale-leaseback transactions for enterprise facilities. Here’s a look at some of the highlights:","Serverfarm has recently acquired a 153,000 square foot facility in Suwannee, Georgia that had been owned by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).","Ascent Corp.entered the Atlanta market in 2017 through a sale/leaseback deal with an enterprise tenant. The ATL1 facility is a 185,000 square foot building on a 38-acre secure site in the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta. A tenant occupies two data halls, but there is up to 8 MW of server-ready space, with the ability to add another 75,000 square feet of capacity if needed.","Colocation provider Green House Data continued to build its national footprint with the April 2017 acquisition of Cirracore, an Atlanta-based infrastructure provider of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and hybrid cloud products.","In the downtown market, CAPRE panelists expected continued activity at 250 Williams Street, the 1 million square foot mixed-use building that once housed the headquarters for the 1996 Olympic Games. The building also includes 300,000 square feet of data center space, and has 130,000 SF of powered shell space available. While representing just 30 percent of the space, data center tenants generate 60 percent of the revenue. New owner Carter Validus says it will work to shift the tenant mix toward data center tenants.","“I think we’ve got a pretty significant upside there,” said Whitaker. “This building has extreme infrastructure in place, and we’re hitting the market at a really good time.”","Other downtown data center hubs include 56 Marietta, which is owned by Digital Realty/Telx, its neighboring building at 55 Marietta, and 180 Peachtree Street, which Singapore’s Maplewood recently acquired from Carter Validus.","Creating A New Market","The new Facebook project is notable not just for its size, but for its location. Stanton Springs is in Newton County, about 40 miles East of downtown Atlanta.","“It’s breaking a brand new market that didn’t exist,” said Kramlich. “There aren’t any data centers out there.”","By 2020 there will be two new data centers on the Facebook campus, with about 970,000 square feet of space. The data center will be supported by renewable energy from the Walton Electric Membership Corporation (EMC), which will install hundreds of acres of solar panels on Georgia’s electric grid as part of a power supply agreement with Facebook.","Georgia’s power story is a critical part of its recent success, according to Tim Huffman, a Senior Vice President at CBRE, who said Georgia Power offers rates that can range from 5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) to as low as 3.5 cents per kWh. “The cost of power in Georgia is a key factor in what’s happening in Atlanta,” said Huffman.","Young said Switch is working on an agreement to provide renewable energy to support its new data center, but cited the importance of the Atlanta region’s energy profile. “The ability for Georgia Power to provide clean, renewable energy was a major reason we came to Atlanta,” she said.","At the CAPRE panel, Atlanta-area data center executives expressed optimism about the year to come.","“We see quite a mix of prospects,” said T5’s Kramlich. “In 2018, I think we’ll see a lot of growth and a whole variety of choices.”","“We’re seeing strong demand from healthcare,” said Allen Skipper, Vice President of Strategic Sales at Flexential (formerly Peak 10), which operates facilities in Alpharetta and Norcross, and is deploying a new data center design. “It’s easier to come in with 50,000 square feet than a million square feet,” he added.","Young says Switch has experience building a million square feet, and that new streams of demand from new technologies will generate even more data to store and manage.","“The pie just keeps getting bigger,” said Young. “Ninety percent of all data has been created in the last two years. There’s plenty of business to go around.”","Stay informed: Get our news updates!","About Rich Miller","I write about the places where the Internet lives, telling the story of data centers and the people who build them.

The story included a limousine, cocaine and a host of other interesting tidbits. There are few reports of the incident because Sinclair could never provide hard evidence, and he has a very long rap sheet.","News broke in early January that Trump’s lawyer paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, a large sum in order to keep her affair with the president secret.","Michael Cohen, a longtime lawyer for the Trump Organization, was reportedly the architect of the $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford in October 2016.

We say that it wouldn’t be too hard for us to walk away from it. And then we keep on using the social media that threatens our privacy.","Both polling data and scientific research suggest that, whatever the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has staying power. That’s largely because it offers users real benefits, said Elizabeth Cohen, a professor of communications at West Virginia University who studies social media and society. The people who use it have decided — implicitly, if not explicitly — that those benefits outweigh the risks.","Americans are certainly aware of a data privacy issue connected to social media and advertising. A 2014 Pew survey found that 91 percent of adults thought consumers had lost control over how companies (all companies, not just tech companies) collect and store information about us. Meanwhile, the same survey showed that 64 percent of internet users wanted stronger regulations on advertisers. In fact, long before Cambridge Analytica, Americans were already more distrustful of social media and online advertisers than any other organizations that have access to our data.","And yet we kept giving it to them. Since 2014, Americans’ use of social media has continued to grow, and nearly 70 percent of all U.S. adults now use Facebook. You see this same dynamic play out in the lab. Numerous studies have found evidence for a “privacy paradox” between our statements and our actions. We say we place a high value on privacy, yet our behavior suggests … well, not so much. For instance, a 2012 study found that 95 percent of research subjects reported being interested in protecting their private information. That same group of people was also overwhelmingly willing to shop at a store that required them to provide information about their income and date of birth if it would save them a single euro.","So what makes social media so sticky even though we know it’s also risky? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, lies in the whole “social” part, said Cohen and Andreas Kaplan, a marketing professor who studies social media at the ESCP Europe business school. Social media, and particularly Facebook, has become the place where our social lives happen. Sixty-seven percent of Americans say online communication strengthens their relationships — compared with just 18 percent who say it makes those relationships weaker. If you aren’t on Facebook, you’re missing out on important parts of your friends’ lives — maybe even missing your friends entirely, if they live far from you.","And even though not all of our experiences online are good, more of us report being treated kindly than report hostility. Same with how often we see people help each other on social media rather than needing to leave a social media group because it turned mean.","If you just can’t quit Facebook, it could be because you have decided that the benefits outweigh the risks. Maintaining relationships with far-flung cousins and college friends is valuable to you. That the world could find out you’re a Bernie Bro maybe isn’t.","None of this is to say that you shouldn’t be concerned about privacy on Facebook or other social media. It’s more that when attempting to make a stand against it, you’ll need to grapple with the fact that it really does provide something useful — and that choosing to step away means more than just stepping away from a company, or from a place to share selfies.","Likewise, Cohen pointed out, leaving Facebook isn’t what will protect you and your data from being shared without your permission. Facebook is a big player in collecting and selling your data, but it’s also just one of many entities that do that — think grocery store loyalty cards and gym memberships. Those data sets can be cross-referenced and compared to addresses to learn about you and your family and your friends in ways that are similar to what happens on social media — and some of those offline systems are harder to notice as threats. “There’s an illusion of safety,” Cohen said. “You feel like you could get off, you could opt out.”","“But the point is that it’s everywhere.”","Maggie Koerth-Baker is a senior science writer for FiveThirtyEight. @maggiekb1"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Cook County argues that Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and the SCL Group, its corporate parent, violated users' privacy en masse when they violated Illinois laws against fraud.","Just over a week ago, The New York Times and The Observer, a British newspaper, broke the story that the British data analytics contractor, which worked with Donald Trump's presidential campaign, retained private data from 50 million Facebook users despite claiming to have deleted it.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S.

Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.","Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on 25 May, it “would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue”, said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems. Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.","Shares in Facebook fell on Monday by 7 percent, their biggest drop since 2014, wiping nearly $40 billion off the value of the firm founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg.","Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.","Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for “strategic litigation” over GDPR privacy violations.","According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","“The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn’t adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,” said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.","Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.","Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to “to give much less data, especially about friends,” Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday.","“We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,” the company said on Monday. “We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”","Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook’s overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.","The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.","“If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,” Deutsche Bank warned.","A 3D plastic representation of the Facebook logo. Image: Reuters.","The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.","Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his ‘sell’ rating on Facebook after the weekend reports. Wieser expressed concerns that the company’s regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.","A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is. But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems Inc, which makes sales and marketing software.","PageFair, an Irish startup that helps website deliver non-targeted ads and avoid ad-blocking, estimates that only 3 percent of European social media users will opt-in to targeted ads, a potentially “devastating” blow for Facebook and other platforms, says Johnny Ryan, PageFair’s head of ecosystem.","GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROL","The quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.","GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans’ consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.","Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.","“There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,” she told Reuters.","Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.","For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.","The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.","Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented “in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.”","In other words, the days of extensive “terms of service” agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.","In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more “permissions screens” and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.","That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month. “Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there’s some potential that people decide they’re not going to use the product,” Wehner said. “We don’t think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

And that’s how it sells ads — by using all that stuff it knows about us to help advertisers target us with their ads.","But... What about Instagram?","OK. First of all, Facebook owns Instagram.","Of course you already knew that; you’re a smart cookie. But a recent survey by the Verge found that, 60% of people didn’t know that Facebook owns Instagram. So, just making sure we’re all on the same page here.","Instagram and Facebook use the same advertising tool.","Instagram advertising IS Facebook advertising, and vice versa. If you want to run an ad on Instagram, you do it through the Facebook ad tool. And both Instagram and Facebook share the data they collect about you with each other and advertisers.","So there is no such thing as Instagram-only ads?","Brands and marketers can choose to have ads run only on Instagram and not show up on Facebook. But they still have to place the ads through the Facebook ad manager. So yes, ads can be tailored to only appear on Instagram, but all of that is handled in Facebook’s ad system.","Advertisers can target you based on both your Facebook AND Instagram accounts.","They are essentially one and the same, as far as advertising is concerned. Advertisers can target you on your Instagram based on your Facebook profile, and they can target you on Facebook using information collected from your Instagram account.","What if my Instagram and Facebook are totally different, though?","Let’s say your Facebook is pretty normal, but your Instagram is something totally weird or specific, like only pictures of your dog, and you only follow viral dog accounts. You'll still see ads on Instagram that are based on the overall profile Facebook has created about you, based on all the things it knows about you from both Instagram and Facebook.","Are my likes and follows on Instagram part of what advertisers can use to target me?","Yep. Your likes, your follows, and even everything you search for or just browse through on Instagram and Facebook can help advertisers target you.","What the fuck?!","So do brands know if I like a Kim Kardashian selfie?","Not exactly; they don’t know that you liked it, but all of your Instagram activity is rolled into a whole set of data that advertisers can use to target people like you.","How does a brand use my Instagram activity to target me?","Let’s say an online shoe store wants to target new potential customers. One way it can do this is to upload a list of their customer emails into the Facebook ad manager. Facebook can identify those people from their emails, and then it analyzes those people based on everything it knows about them. Then, it comes up with a new, similar group of potential customers — and that’s who the shoe store should target with its ads. So while your Instagram likes might just be a small detail about you, they help advertisers target you.","What if my Instagram is private?","Sorry, they’re still using your data to target you with ads. Going private on Instagram only affects how other users can see you, and has nothing to do with your data or ad targeting.","What if I use a “finsta” that’s separate from my regular Instagram?","If you’re switching between accounts in the app, it knows they’re connected to the same Facebook account. You might see different ads on the two accounts based on your activity, but they both use your Facebook profile to target you.","Is Facebook or Instagram listening to what I say? The other day I was talking about something out loud and then saw an Instagram ad for it.","No, although lots of people certainly have noticed the same thing. The trick is, Facebook is so good at targeting you that it can tailor Instagram ads scarily well.","I noticed an Instagram ad for something I looked at online recently — what’s up with that?","Should I delete my Instagram??!!","Your call. If all of this freaks you out so much you’re willing to give up the fun and joy of Instagram, then delete. But if Instagram and Facebook bring you joy, then… Here are some tips on how to limit the data you give Facebook.","BuzzFeed’s own Nick Greene, one of our in-house advertising experts (yes, we target people on Facebook to advertise to them too), helped explain some of the details in this post about how Facebook and Instagram ad targeting works.","Katie Notopoulos is a senior editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

They even said it was the only way to solve the problem of mass shootings.","Yet while they're opposed to the horrors of liberal cultural \"social engineering,\" they never said they were against a more social conservative kind of engineering.","GOP Billionaire helped Steal 50 Million Facebook Users Profiles to Elect Trump: Real Americans like Sheldon Adelson, the Koch brothers, and Robert Mercer continue to build on their conservative empire based on special interest influence...money.","(In 2014) Cambridge Analytica had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","Today the denials are flying...but with Democratic pushback:","Whataboutism is Back: The \"WhataboutObama\" contingent quickly pointed to a Guardian article that, no surprise, did not support their case. There's a difference between knowingly using your Facebook account to sign into the Obama campaign, or deceptively completing a Facebook survey that secretly gave permission to use both your information and your friend's for the Trump campaign. Ya think?","Facebook has suspended the data analytics firm that the\nTrump campaign relied on during the 2016 election, saying the firm improperly\nreceived user data and then may have failed to get rid of it.","U.K.-based professor Aleksandr Kogan came up with an app billed on Facebook as a personality predictor \"used by psychologists.\" About 270,000 people downloaded \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" according to Facebook, and in doing so gave away their data; some — depending on security settings — even gave away information about their Facebook friends. Although users may not have realized it, the mining of their personal information was aboveboard; just by downloading the app they had — knowingly or not — consented to giving it away. But they did not consent to Kogan giving it away, Facebook says. And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party. (Facebook changed its rules three years ago to stop developers from seeing information about people's friends.)","It's all about winning, just like they told us over and over:","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules.

I’m sure he needs some advice on how to spend it. Here’s mine: He should use it to undo the terrible damage done by Facebook and other forms of social media to democratic debate and civilized discussion all over the world.","Weak democracies are the most vulnerable to the curse of Facebook. I was recently at a gathering of experts who work in post-conflict countries, and all present agreed: Reconstructing a nation — any nation, whether Libya or East Timor — requires the establishment of a framework for national debate. If nothing else, leaders of the conflict have to agree about why the war ended, why they decided to stop fighting and what will happen next. Then they have to transmit that agreement to their followers. But if this is impossible — because “mainstream” media don’t exist, because Facebook offers conflicting versions of the truth, because no one trusts what they read — then peace is impossible, too.","Poor democracies are equally vulnerable. In countries — and there are more than you think — where reputable, fact-checked, independent media don’t function (because they’re too expensive, because the Internet destroyed the advertising market, because illiberal governments put pressure on the media), then the possibility of civilized conversation disappears, too. If different versions of the truth appear in different online versions; if no one can agree upon what actually happened yesterday; if fake, manipulated or mendacious news websites are backed up by mobs of Internet trolls; then conspiracy theories, whether of the far left or far right, will soon have the same weight as reality. Politicians who lie will be backed by a claque of supporters.","Rich democracies haven’t realized that this is also fast becoming their problem. Whenever I’ve described the disappearance of facts and the growth of Internet fantasy while in London or Washington, the response has usually been rather smug: How very terrible for all of those people in Tunisia or Slovakia, but “it couldn’t happen here.” But it can and it has: Donald Trump claimed that “thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey cheered the collapse of the World Trade Center, and thousands of real commenters and bloggers rushed to his defense on Facebook and elsewhere. Never mind that it didn’t happen: It is now possible to live in a virtual reality where Trump’s lies are acclaimed as the hidden truth that the mainstream media have concealed from the masses.","Those who don’t live in Trump’s world can find alternatives, of course. Ali Amin, a Virginia teenager, was so entranced by the world of online jihad that he became “absorbed in a ‘virtual’ struggle while disconnecting from what was real.” He wound up with an 11-year prison sentence for providing material support to a terrorist group. Nor is that kind of experience reserved for jihadis. Anyone who spends any time in the many alternative worlds that can be accessed via Twitter or Facebook can encounter similarly false information, in many forms and in many languages, every day. Just follow the right Twitter accounts, and you’ll get links to the fake websites and dubious organizations that produce invented statistics. You’ll find friends who believe in the invented statistics, too. If you so desire, you can then go on to live in a bubble entirely divorced from any reality except one created by far-right bloggers, left-wing anarchists or Kremlin spin doctors, all of whom excel at developing this kind of alternate reality.","Many of those who do the inventing have particular political goals, such as the election of Trump, or the recruitment of Islamic State volunteers. But the longer-term impact of disinformation is even more profound: It creates cynicism and apathy. Eventually it means that nobody believes anything. People aren’t bothered by Trump’s lies — or Vladimir Putin’s lies, or the Islamic State’s lies — because they don’t believe anything they read anyway. There’s so much garbage information out there, it’s impossible to know what is true.","Nobody yet knows what to do about this sea change, because few people have even accepted that it is happening or understand how it works. There’s a wide-open space for Zuckerberg to help journalists, academics, activists and politicians figure out how to bring reality back into public debate. Maybe we need to study “media literacy” in schools; maybe we need independent “accuracy indexes” to rate websites; maybe we need to work on understanding the psychology of conspiracy theorists. We don’t know yet what works, but it’s time we started trying to figure it out. And that is a $45 billion question.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Anne ApplebaumAnne Applebaum is a Washington Post columnist, covering national politics and foreign policy, with a special focus on Europe and Russia.

Facebook is removing this privacy setting, notifying those who had hidden themselves that they’ll be searchable. It deleted the option from those who hadn’t used it in December, and is starting to push everyone to use privacy controls on each type of content they share. But there’s no one-click opt out of Facebook search.","To be fair, the “Who can look up your Timeline by name?” feature was likely misunderstood by lots of people. At first glance, you might assume it means that strangers can’t find your profile. But that’s incorrect. There have been lots of ways to navigate to your profile, like clicking your name on a photo you’re tagged in, finding your name in a friend’s friend list, or combing through Likes on a mutual friend’s News Feed post.","With the roll out of Graph Search, the avenues for sniffing out someone’s profile grew exponentially. Basically every piece of personal information (and soon the content you post about) could bring you up in a search. If you publicly list that you live in San Francisco, a Graph Search for “People who live in San Francisco” could lead someone to your profile.","It also led people to think search was broken in some cases. If I met someone through a Facebook Group and wanted to friend them, I might search for them and not be able to find them if they had used this privacy setting. But what’s more important are the safety implications.","Keeping this privacy option around gave people a false sense of security. For that reason, it’s wise for Facebook to remove it. But it should have provided an ever stronger universal privacy control for opting out of search, not a slew of weaker ones.","Over the new few months, users who’ve employed the privacy setting to avoid being searched by name will see a big announcement at the top of their Facebook homepage explaining what’s happening. They’ll have to confirm they understand the change before they’re put back into name search and the privacy setting disappears from their options.","After that, the way people can stay hidden is to manually restrict the visibility of each piece of their profile. And that is a bit of a chore. You’d have to go through every piece of personal information in your About section and set its visibility to ‘Friends’ or ‘Only me’. At least Facebook provides a quick way to restrict the visibility of all your old News Feed posts.","Serious privacy aficionados should remember that your current profile picture and cover image are always public, so you’d have to leave those blank if you didn’t want anyone to any idea of who you are beyond your name.","For people with stalkers, though, Facebook may have just gotten a bit more dangerous. Facebook tells me the way to keep a specific person from finding your profile or viewing any of your content is to block them. But what if your stalker just signs up for a fake profile with a new name? Then they could search and find you.","One solution is to use a fake name. Though that violates Facebook’s terms of service, it’s a popular solution for job seekers and privacy buffs to avoid bosses and ex-lovers.","This is where there’s friction, as Facebook’s mission to connect the world, responsibility to generate returns for its investors, and its duty to keep people’s privacy safe come into conflict. Facebook is not just trying to make more money, and designing easy privacy controls is no simple task. In the last two years it’s added in-line controls for everything as well as privacy shortcuts in the navigation bar, but I feel like Facebook could do more.","The social network could surely offer an option to lock down all your personal information the same way it does for your old posts, but it doesn’t. It could offer a way to opt out of appearing in any type of search results, not just searches for your name, but it doesn’t. It wants your friends to be able to find you. It wants Graph Search to be a comprehensive utility. It wants to foster the connection your friendship and News Feed posts generate, which also keep it in business. But it’s protecting its access to these things by sacrificing your right to choose just how much your identity is indexed."],"isopubdate":"2013-10-10"}

So wanting to ditch it entirely makes sense, but sadly it’s not as easy as simply dragging an app icon to the recycle bin.","Also, we realise that for lots of people they need a Facebook account for work, or find it a useful tool for keeping track of birthdays and events, making giving it the cold shoulder difficult or impossible. If quitting isn’t an option these are some of the ways you can still get utility out of the social network while protecting your privacy.","Take control of your data","The first step is to turn off Facebook’s access to your location services, because this is like having a creepy stalker who knows where you work and where you sleep (and where you do anything else, for that matter). Having it turned on gives Facebook access to every move you make, which of course it wants, because this is hugely valuable to advertisers.","iPhone: To turn off or limit Facebook’s access to your location on iOS, head to your iPhone’s Settings app, scroll down to “Privacy” under the general tab, and tap Location Services.","Android: Head to “Account Settings,” tap “Location.” From there, you can toggle Facebook’s access from on to off.","Second — and this is the really important one — you need to delink all of the dodgy apps that have gained access to your personal data. This is an easy, but crucial step you need to take, and it’s easiest to do from a web browser on a laptop or desktop computer.","On Facebook: Head over to the “Apps” section of your Facebook settings. At the top of the page, you’ll see the total number of apps you’re logged into using Facebook. Simply disconnect them.","Do you feel lighter yet? It’s like a spring clean for your social media – something you should probably do on a regular basis. But we aren’t done yet — you need to edit your “About Me” section to limit the amount of total information you’re sharing with Facebook at all times.","On Facebook: Click on that question mark icon in the upper right corner of the page and click on “Privacy Checkup”. When you get to step number two, you will have the option to go to your About Page. From there, you can edit or delete all types of information you’ve shared on Facebook.","Disconnect other apps","This step needs to be done before you delete your Facebook account once and for all — but can also be done as a general cleanup for the OCD-types","You’ve probably used Facebook to log into other apps and services before. Its a super easy way to log in, and admit it — we are super lazy. Problem is, those logins inadvertently burrowed you deeper into Facebook’s grasp. It’s reversible, but it’ll require some time to undo.","Make a list of all the apps you log into using Facebook. One way to figure this out is to go to Facebook > Settings > Apps. Scroll through this list and make note of the apps and websites you still use. One by one, log into those apps. Visit the Settings page and find the option to disconnect from Facebook. This process varies quite a bit, so you might want to Google “disconnect Facebook from [insert app here]” to speed things up. See this example from Pinterest.","Keep all your memories","If you’ve decided you want to breakup with Facebook properly, before you hit that ‘delete’ button remember to download your precious memories. This is an easy step that could still be a little time-consuming, depending on how much data your profile is comprised of.","Your Facebook archive contains just about all the information related to your account, including your photos, active sessions, chat history, IP addresses, facial recognition data, and which ads you clicked, just to name a few. That’s a ton of personal information that you probably want to keep (depending on how angry you are at the social media platform).","To download your archive, go to “Settings” and click “Download a copy of your Facebook data” at the bottom of General Account Settings, and then click “Start My Archive.” You will receive an email with a link to download – and voila! You have all your personal info (depending on how long your download takes).","Take the leap","Are you ready? Sure? Here’s how to get rid of Facebook for real:","You have a choice of permanently deleting Facebook, or rather just deactivating your account. Permanently deleting your account is irreversible — all of your data will be removed, your profile will disappear and you’ll need to sign up for Facebook again if you want back in. If you do go this route you’ll need to avoid logging in for a few weeks, otherwise your account will be reactivated. And yes, Facebook is going to try hard to get you not to delete your account. Be strong, click through all the “are you sure?” messages, and in a few weeks you’ll have vanished from the service.","Alternatively, you can take the less extreme route and deactivate your account. This essentially puts your account on hold, so you can restore it to the same state it was in when you left it. This also lets you continue using Facebook Messenger.","Facebook doesn’t have the delete account option in its settings, for some reason. Once you click “Delete My Account,” your account will be marked for termination, and inaccessible to others using Facebook.","The company does warn that your account may take up to 90 days to delete all of your personal information — and you cannot log-in in that time or they will cancel deletion immediately. So self-control is key here. Check out all of the rules here.","If you’re really serious about quitting Facebook, remember that the company owns several other popular services as well, like Instagram and WhatsApp, that also share personal data. We will never truly be safe anywhere on the internet and the key here is to be aware of what you sign up for when clicking that “Accept” button. Most times people willingly give companies access to personal info without knowing.","So what have we learned? Read the Terms & Conditions — no matter how long they are."],"isopubdate":""}

At the time, the FTC contended that Facebook made users' information public without warning them or asking for permission. The decree mandated that the social media company notify users and obtain their consent to share information with third parties.","\"The FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook,\" Tom Pahl, acting director of the agency's bureau of consumer protection, said in a statement. \"Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.\"","As reported last week, the FTC is interested in whether Facebook's handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal violated the decree it signed more than six years ago. Facebook is under intense scrutiny after The New York Times, The Guardian and the Observer revealed that Cambridge Analytica -- a data consultancy that helps businesses and political parties \"change audience behavior\" -- had gotten its hands on data from tens of millions of Facebook users.","That data came from an app created by University of Cambridge neuroscientist Aleksander Kogan.

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B.

In an instant, the campaign had a way to see the hidden young voters. Roughly 85% of those without a listed phone number could be found in the uploaded friend lists. What’s more, Facebook offered an ideal way to reach them. ‘People don’t trust campaigns. They don’t even trust media organizations,’ says Goff [Teddy Goff, the Obama campaign’s former digital director]. ‘Who do they trust? Their friends.’”","Davidsen also shared a link to a talk from 2015, in which she recalled how Facebook’s privacy policies in 2012 helped the Obama team win an army of supporters.","“The privacy policies at that time on Facebook were – if they opted in, they could tell us who all their friends were.

By booting the companies from its platform \"pending further information,\" Facebook will no longer allow them to buy ads or manage their pages.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of what we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook,\"Grewel said, noting that Facebook had received recent reports of certain rules violations.","According to Grewal's statement, a University of Cambridge professor who had developed a personality prediction app for Facebook users called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" improperly passed user information to other parties, including Cambridge Analytica and SCL in 2015. Facebook allows some apps to get access to a user's profile and important data that identifies the user's preferences and interests.","Facebook said the professor, Cambridge Analytica, and the other parties involved agreed to destroy all the data at the time. But, Grewel said on Friday, \"several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.","Such information, if misused, can potentially help bad actors target Facebook users with ads and other information. This was apparently the case during the 2016 US presidential election. Trump's campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June that year to help target ads using voter data gathered from millions of adults in the US.","Several news outlets reported in 2016 that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million for its services in September alone that year, a significant increase from the $250,000 it paid one month earlier.","The matter of those emails and an FBI investigation surrounding Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state had hamstrung the Clinton campaign, and was seen as one part of a broader effort by Russian operatives to influence the US election.","It also raised questions about whether Trump associates had cooperated with Russia's election-meddling activity, because Russian operatives capitalized on detailed user data to deliver targeted ads and content on Facebook and other social-media platforms.","Worries about whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin arose in part because the content touted by Russian state actors was highly specific, and targeted to competitive US voter precincts — details that some experts have said would not have been familiar to a foreign entity.","The Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica, and has denied any wrongdoing.","In an email to Business Insider, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said the company \"fully complies with Facebook's terms of service\" and said it is working with Facebook to resolve the matter.","Read Cambridge Analytica's full statement below:","\"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook's terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.","Cambridge Analytica's Commercial and Political divisions use social media platforms for outward marketing, delivering data-led and creative content to targeted audiences. They do not use or hold data from Facebook profiles.","In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States.","This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR was also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. GSR obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook.","When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR.","We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.","Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.\"","We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.","We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies","Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\" Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","How Things Have Changed","We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they're looking to collect and how they're going to use it - before they're allowed to even ask people for it.","In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time.","On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps.","We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

{"originalurl":"https://lawfareblog.com/no-facebook-its-not-about-security-its-about-privacy","title":"No, Facebook, It's Not about Security; It's About Privacy - Lawfare","text":["No, Facebook, It's Not about Security; It's About Privacy","Finally, Mark Zuckerberg has spoken. The short version of his response? “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.” But Zuckerberg is wrong. The Cambridge Analytica scandal is not about a failure to secure users’ data; it is a failure to protect the privacy of users’ data. And Facebook is in no position to change that, for the sharing of user data lies at the heart of Facebook’s business.","Let’s start with unpacking the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It begins with personality quizzes. Is your favorite hobby running or cooking? You’re probably conscientious. Prefer Nightwish to the rapper Waka Flocka Flame? That suggests a more introverted personality. Tests such as these can predict who you are and, more importantly in the context of the scandal, how you are likely to vote.","Cambridge University’s Aleksandr Kogan—also known as Aleksandr Spectre—studies such issues. Kogan developed a personality-quiz Facebook app called thisisyourdigitallife. He needed data, massive amounts of it, so he used his private company, Global Science Research, to run surveys and recruit test takers. The company paid people to take the personality test—or rather, Kogan contracted with Cambridge Analytica, which provided funds to pay for people to take the test. A total of 270,000 did so.","The test takers agreed to let Kogan harvest data from their Facebook account. Because Facebook’s vision was that every app should be “socially enabled” to simplify engagement and connection, Kogan was also able to collect data about the quiz takers’ Facebook friends—all 50 million of them. Only people who had explicitly opted out of this Facebook feature were protected from Kogan’s data collection; being able to do so was not easy. Facebook has since locked this feature—I’d call it a bug—down. Kogan said he was collecting the information for academic research, but his company gave the data to Cambridge Analytica.","This occurred in 2014. According to Facebook vice president Andrew Bosworth, in 2015 Facebook became aware of the data “sharing,” which violated the terms of service under which Kogan had obtained the information of Facebook users. The company demanded that Cambridge Analytica delete the Facebook data in its files. Cambridge Analytica said it had complied, and for Facebook, that was the end of the story.","But it wasn't the end of the story. Cambridge Analytica had not deleted the data; instead, it used the information to conduct micro-targeting of U.S. voters during the 2016 presidential campaign and quite likely changed the course of events.","Facebook failed in multiple ways. The core failure was, and is, excessive information-sharing. The decision that enabled Kogan to scrape the data from 50 million accounts through the acquiescence of the original 270,000 personality quiz takers is not a security breach—it was a conscious Facebook choice to encourage huge information-sharing. That comes at the expense of privacy. Kogan’s obtaining personal data from those 50 million accounts was a major privacy breach—one that was enabled as a result of Facebook’s core vision.","Moreover, Facebook failed to conduct due diligence when it learned in 2015 that Kogan had provided Cambridge Analytica with the information he had gleaned on the 50 million Facebook users. That data dump was a violation of the terms of service under which Kogan had obtained the data. Asking Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted the data—which is all Facebook required from the company—was completely inadequate. One would hope that Facebook lawyers and policy folks understood this. But privacy runs counter to Facebook’s raison d’etre. Proper actions and attention to privacy were sorely lacking.","Finally, Facebook had a moral responsibility to let all 50 million of those users know that their data had been shared with Cambridge Analytica. Mark Zuckerberg has said the company will do so now. That’s good. But it is four years—and one presidential election—too late.","Various privacy agencies are examining whether Facebook improperly handled user data. But as I’ve written earlier this year, we lack adequate legal tools to protect privacy:","The tools available to the [Federal Trade Commission] and state attorneys general are limited. The commission can assess civil penalties for violations of certain privacy statutes and regulations, and it can issue fines. But the former are limited and the latter low because the fines must reflect calculable losses suffered by consumers. State prosecutors are similarly hampered by having to prove that breaches led to actual harm. These legal constraints limit prosecution in cases where there are real losses but not of high monetary value.","There is a huge mismatch here. The use of user data is how online social networks work. In 2012, Tyler Moore and I studied identity management (the way users are authenticated) and data sharing. We observed that identity providers that shared lots of data with other providers—think of these as apps—were far more successful as “identity providers”:","Facebook provides a centralized system where its users can log in to third-party Web sites using Facebook credentials. To attract wary Service Providers, Facebook shares social network information in addition to demographic information ... [From] OpenID, the Service Provider only learns the e-mail address, while with Facebook the Service Provider learns the name, gender, list of friends, and all public information stored by Facebook. All profile information, including birthday, education and work history is also shared ... [Thus] it should be no surprise that [Facebook] has succeeded in attracting the participation of many more Service Providers than OpenID has.","As long as social networks rely on advertising based on user data, rather than a subscription model, to drive their business, there will be excessive use of personal data. That's why Zuckerberg's response—“Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform”—is notable for its emphasis on security and its lack of attention to privacy. As Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos observed, Cambridge Analytica was not a data breach. Cambridge Analytica’s use of the personal information of 50 million Facebook users was a privacy breach. And so far, Facebook is making precious few alterations to fix that problem.","I'll end on a personal note: In 2012 I wanted to teach a freshman seminar at Harvard on Privacy and Online Social Networks. But because I care about privacy, the only social network I was on was LinkedIn. A fellow faculty member told me I’d have no credibility teaching the course. I taught a course called “Is Privacy Dead?” instead (our conclusion was no, but that it was in great danger). Several years later, I received a LinkedIn connect request, but to an email address I had not supplied to the company. I wrote the person who appeared to have initiated the request and asked if he had done so. If not, I was quitting LinkedIn. I wanted the company to be using the data I supplied them, not to be vacuuming up other information about me. My contact said no, he had not, and could I please tell him how to leave LinkedIn. That did it; within minutes I left LinkedIn. I imagine he did as well.","Sure, not being on social networks is costly. I don’t see photos of a friend’s trip to Tuscany, and I’m not able to advertise my new book nearly as well. But as the recent events have shown, my privacy and security are better protected when I eschew these platforms. So I think my Harvard colleague was wrong. I think I had much more credibility to teach Privacy and Online Social Networks than if I had been on Facebook. It seems many others are coming to the same conclusion. Until the online social networks change how they operate, getting off of these websites is a necessary step for protecting whatever privacy any of us have left.","Editor's Note: Since the publishing of this piece, the New York Times has reported that Cambridge Analytica may have harvested data from as many as 87 million users. This post operates off of an earlier estimate of 50 million.","Susan Landau is Bridge Professor in the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and the School of Engineering, Department of Computer Science, Tufts University.

Wylie spoke to both outlets, saying he and Kogan \"exploited\" Facebook.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,\" Wylie told the Guardian. \"And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"","According to the Guardian, data was harvested from 50 million profiles and Facebook failed to inform uses and did little to recover the data. Although only 270,000 downloaded Kogan's app, there was a loophole at Facebook at the time that allowed app developers to not only see the data of people who downloaded the app but also everyone in that user's friend network, Wired senior reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday.","Wylie's attorney, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement when Facebook learned about the articles, the company \"privately welcomed\" his help but then criticized him publicly and suspended his account.","\"This behavior is more consistent with damage limitation than with a genuine attempt to resolve a serious problem,\" Allen said. \"None of this would have been revealed without Mr Wylie speaking out and taking his share of responsibility. Facebook should be doing the same rather than simply blaming others.\"","A Facebook spokesperson has since responded saying: \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Guardian reporter Carole Cadwalladr told CBSN on Saturday that Facebook knew about the illicit data harvesting two years ago and never acted.","\"This continual pattern that we've seen with Facebook -- trying to shut the story down, finally when it has no choice, acknowledge it. They've just really got to do better,\" she said.","In a statement via his attorney, Wylie said he \"helped set up\" Cambridge Analytica when he was 23 years old and he says he now feels \"a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world.\" Cambridge Analytica pushed back against the claim that he was a founder, tweeting Saturday that Wylie was a \"contractor.\"","Cambridge Analytica insisted Saturday that Kogan's company, Global Science Research (GSR) harvested the data. The company said once it learned GSR sold it data that it shouldn't have, it deleted the data.","Cambridge Analytica became a household name in 2016 after it was hired by the Trump campaign's digital guru, Brad Parscale. While the Trump campaign has downplayed the role Cambridge Analytica played in his victory, the firm said after the election that they were key to his victory and Parscale has been named campaign manager for President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the Trump campaign.","Special counsel Robert Mueller in December asked Cambridge Analytica to turn over internal documents as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, The New York Times reports. Additionally, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said that Cambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix has approached him about working together in the release of hacked emails on the Clinton campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)","NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months.","The changes won't affect Facebook's privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users. But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.","Wednesday's announcement follows revelations that a President Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for \"some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\"","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page.","Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding \"clearer explanations\" about how its privacy controls work.","Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, called the new settings \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns.","Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.","To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called \"access your information,\" a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That's where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.","Cox said that while the changes are \"in line with the principle of GDPR,\" there's also a \"bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\"","ABC7's Lindsey Mastis shows us how to use the new privacy settings on Facebook Live.

This looming backdrop of a serious ‘reality’ check on Facebook comes on the heels of the past weekend revelations that a very controversial political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook users. Trust me when I tell you – this is only the tip of the iceberg.","From what I gather, Facebook ‘is’ the Dark Web. Do some deep digging down the rabbit hole of Facebook groups and their Messenger app and you’ll start to see what I’m talking about. I’m not talking about Tor, I’m talking about a social gathering full of numerous really bad groups with various illegal activities occurring through social media communications within this platform – that’s another topic for another time. Even our government is concerned with this tool as a recruiting platform for terrorism. It’s a pretty serious matter. However, let’s not forget that in the USA, you do have a right to free speech. The problem is, you’re on a platform that is NOT-transparent as to who and what they decide will be allowed on or what they may or may not share. That remains “proprietary.” See here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_and_social_media.","More specifically, for this article, let’s just focus on this simple fact: either Facebook will continue to lose customers and value by the billions, or they will realize that Privacy matters. Let me solve a few key Facebook problems quickly for them, at no charge, while they meet with highly paid consultants who brainstorm on how to continue to steal your privacy, I mean garnish your demographics, but make you feel good about it. That won’t work anymore. Nor will nodding heads from Facebook executives sitting in on Congressional hearings. GDPR from the European Union (EU) and the potential risks of lawsuits from the EU will keep the REAL pressure on about truly understanding the value of consumer PRIVACY.","Facebook is at a crossroads. They have an opportunity to become a great trusted brand but it’s a very hard road for them to travel. The enticements of spying on you are ingrained in their culture. I will share two simple tips that could be leveraged as the BEGINNING of a TURNAROUND, else expect more value loss, loss of customers and potentially, US Government Regulations and Oversight that no company ever really wants to deal with. Remember SOX-404 – that alone cost companies billions so they could prove they were not going to be the next Enron. Facebook now faces a similar challenge – what is the true value of TRUST and PRIVACY? They’ve lost billions overnight so that’s a good sign for how we value these two key issues.","When we think about strong privacy, as InfoSec professionals, we usually think about best practices in key management, encrypting customer records and complying with government regulations to guard this private information under HIPAA/HITECH or GLBA or the EU GDPR, for example. But have we stopped to think about and even cross correlate how strong privacy should permeate more than just customer records? What about your personal privacy? What about your telephone conversations, your emails, what you had for lunch today, where you travel each day, what web sites you visit, who your close friends are and even what you chose to do in your own home, even your bedroom?","By convenience, the internet has fostered a technological revolution the likes of which we have not seen in centuries. Humanity is that much closer but at the same time, there are dark forces using all of these interconnections to collect massive amounts of data, in real-time, all the time on all of us. From the SmartTV’s with built-in microphones and internet access over wifi, whereby their own privacy policy that you didn’t take time to read, clearly states that someone aka “the manufacturer” is listening in on you, in your own living room or bedroom.","We have to start talking about strong privacy and why it is good through the entire product lifecycle and inherently needed in the sourcing of hardware and software that make the internet work, in our PCs, smartphones, IoT gear – in everything we use.","On top of this we have the ongoing battle between Apple and the FBI in the name of National Security, which I’ve frequently talked and written about.","“National Security and safety for its citizens in any nation state, especially the US, is greater, when products from these countries are hardened, not weakened, containing no back-doors.”","So I will argue with you, now, that the Facebook app and their Messenger app is one giant piece of spyware that needs to be fixed. In addition, as a social media tool, they go where the money or power is going. If there is a gun law debate, they will blacklist groups like the NRA or others but allow funded advertisements for movies loaded with gun violence and some of our favorite and most popular video games. If you live in Facebook, forget the Bill of Rights. This is why there is a huge backlash right now.","Facebook advertisements allegedly brainwash you to change your vote. The Russian government allegedly funded advertisements on Facebook for 100k USD or less and it totally changed your mind and brainwashed you. Right? While I strongly disagree with this claim (because I believe you are smarter than many of those you accidentally elected and trusted who want to help you by taking your rights away), it’s real simple. Add some simple geotagging transparency to advertisement sources, if you really feel this is such a big problem.","MY SOLUTION: Geotagging and Country Flag Icon","Geolocate the source of an Advertisement before approving it, add the country flag, alt-tag country name and link back to a map of the globe. “This advertisement is linking to Russia (or USA, or China or hundreds of other countries of source)”. Now you can’t be ‘brainwashed’ because you have a nation state flag to source the advertisement.","Moving onto the bigger issue, let’s take a quick trip in time. It’s 1949, George Orwell just published his dystopian novel “1984,” he warned of a future world in which “Big Brother is Watching You”…Back to today – as the Snowden scandal and other CIA, NSA and FBI revelations have revealed government surveillance is omnipresent, covert and practiced on a global scale that Orwell might never have imagined.","It’s 1984, Apple Computer aired its historic TV commercial concluding that with the introduction of the Macintosh “you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like “1984”. Ironically, 34 years later, while Macs and other personal computers gave birth to the knowledge revolution that transformed how information is created and shared worldwide, in many ways…if you don’t understand why 2018 is “1984” you will never be able to understand why governments and hackers continue to have access to private information, nearly whenever they want it.","But Facebook is better at spying…I mean ‘gathering consumer analytics’ for ‘marketing and other various purposes.’ In fact, Apple asked them to stop calling the GPS function so frequently as it was draining the iPhone batteries! Don’t believe me, just go here: https://tinyurl.com/facebook-battery-drain","We’ve heard the news. Facebook knows more about you than the NSA and wants to sell YOU and your DATA as the PRODUCT to governments, consulting firms and advertisers.","MY SOLUTION: An Independent Transparent PRIVACY COUNCIL for this company.","Facebook hires privacy experts ,forms an PRIVACY COUNCIL or PRIVACY ADVISORY BOARD and tells the truth about all their means and methods to obtain information. Of course this council would recommend PRIVACY OPT-OUT options to be easily accessed by any consumer. A wizard, a dashboard, a scanner – ‘here’s where and why we collect data on you (and others, including apps you gave permission to) and here’s how to opt out of EVERYTHING or granularly.","Most likely Facebook will continue to believe that owning all the data on everyone and selling it to the highest bidder is still the right business model, so I anticipate https://mewe.com/ and numerous others that PROMISE PRIVACY such as https://diasporafoundation.org/ or maybe LinkedIn which is mainly used for business purposes will take advantage of this huge VACUUM and fill it with a PRIVACY LINKEDIN that operates like MeWe or Diaspora Foundation? LinkedIn is huge and promising. They have the foundation but would their VP of Marketing agree with my views and philosophy that PRIVACY is a RIGHT and FREEDOM of SPEECH is also a RIGHT and that by offering a social media platform that values PRIVACY and FREE SPEECH, there are many other ways to monetize. In fact, wouldn’t you pay $9.95 per month to NOT be a TOOL or a PRODUCT and stop being spied on while garnishing the benefits of Social Media and the Internet? I would happily do so. Would you?

We also look at the OIG’s recommendations for the FDA when reviewing medical devices before they hit the market. We conclude by shedding some light on how using AI to create synthetic brain cancer scans actually preserves privacy. Welcome back to Hacking Healthcare.","Authors note: In recognition of the H-ISAC’s increased focus on international healthcare, we will be adding additional information regarding policy and legislative hearings from around the world. We welcome any feedback on how to make this as useful as possible.","Hot Links –","1. Apple Watch’s Medical Makeover.","Last week Apple revealed an upgraded Apple watch with new heart-monitoring and fall-detection capabilities. The new Apple watch contains electrodes and sensors that convert the watch into an electrocardiogram (“ECG”) with the capacity to measure a heart’s electrical activity and detect disorders and irregularities. These new utilities make the Apple watch seem more like a medical device than simply a timepiece, and reflect a larger trend among tech companies that are now dabbling in medical monitoring.","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) seems to be optimistic about the watch’s potential, stating that the new features “may help millions of users identify health concerns more quickly.” The FDA approved marketing of the ECG app and irregular-rhythm notification on the watch on Tuesday, the day before Apple’s big reveal. The FDA’s approval came just a day after the Department of Health & Human Services Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) released a report containing recommendations for the FDA regarding cybersecurity and the agency’s medical device review process.","As referenced above, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) recently released a report following a study examining the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) review of cybersecurity in premarket submissions for networked medical devices. Currently, FDA reviews cybersecurity documentation in premarket submissions prior to allowing the device to be marketed. Using 2014 guidance on the content of premarket submissions and cybersecurity, FDA reviewers consider whether a device demonstrates known cybersecurity risks and threats in addition to reviewing any documentation provided by the device manufacturer that would describe the device’s cybersecurity risks, controls, and threats that the manufacturer has already considered.","Following the study, OIG recommended that FDA make better use of the presubmission meetings to address cybersecurity-related questions by including cybersecurity documentation as a criterion in FDA’s Refuse-To-Accept checklists. The FDA uses these checklists to screen submissions for completeness, and the checklists currently do not include checks for cybersecurity information. Additionally, OIG recommended that FDA include cybersecurity as an element in its Smart template, a tool that the FDA uses to guide reviews of submissions.","3. AI Application in Healthcare That Actually Preserves Privacy.","The trouble with rare medical conditions is, well, they are rare. Of course this makes it difficult for medical professionals to have enough data readily available so that they can detect abnormalities as early as possible. AI researchers from Nvidia teamed up with the Mayo Clinic and the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science to understand how to use generative adversarial networks (“GANS”) to create synthetic brain MRI images. GANS essentially are comprised of two AI systems: one that creates images and another that works to differentiate between synthetic and real images. The result is that the two networks are trained such that the discriminatory system is unable to distinguish between real images and synthesized images.","This type of machine learning opens the medical field up to a much larger dataset for all types of conditions, including those that are especially rare. The beauty of it is that once the dataset is created, it can be accessed and shared broadly without running into the types of patient privacy concerns associated with traditional data collection. Researchers are actively exploring other ways to apply machine learning to medical research, and we can expect even more innovative applications to come.","As a reminder, this is the public version of the Hacking Healthcare blog.

{"originalurl":"http://thebea.st/2u3haoP?source=twitter&via=mobile","title":"It’s Not Just Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, & Trump—The Whole Web Is Stalking You","text":["Cambridge Analytica is no outlier. The horror is not that Cambridge Analytica demographically and psychologically profiled 50 million Facebook users, but that everyone is doing it. Cambridge Analytica did not exploit a loophole. Rather, they used Facebook’s big data the way it was intended. They just marketed a candidate instead of a product. (These days, there’s not that much of a difference.)","That’s the problem with big data: It doesn’t come with signs, let alone rules, declaring CAN ONLY BE USED FOR GOOD. Once the data is out there, people will find a way to use it for whatever they want: marketing, surveillance, or propaganda.","Or, as the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global put it: “We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then, and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again,” he said. “Like a remote control. It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘that’s propaganda’, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’, the next question is, ‘who’s put that out?’”","Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies.","— Facebook","There is an absurdity here: Facebook admits it allows third-party apps to collect intimate data on its users. The only restriction is that the app creators can’t then reshare the data. In other words, the restrictions are on things that Facebook cannot possibly police proactively.","This, too, has long been Facebook’s strategy. In 2008, Facebook rolled out Facebook Beacon, a program to put invisible “web bugs” on pages across the internet. Beacon tracked Facebook users across the internet and posted their activity to their Facebook walls. Buy some baby clothes on Amazon, and it would announce the fact on Facebook, without your permission. There was an outcry, and eventually Facebook shut Beacon down.","But it didn’t give up. By splashing its Like button across the internet, by placing third-party cookies and Facebook logins on other sites, and by acquiring user data directly from third parties, Facebook continued devouring personal information. That personal information is what made Facebook a treasure trove for advertisers and marketers—and, as we now know, for Cambridge Analytica, the political microtargeting firm that helped get Donald Trump elected. An enormous industry of hundreds of firms sprung up around demographic profiling, marketing, and real-time bidding in order to sell online advertising to the right user at the right time. Facebook is the highest-profile broker for this kind of advertising, but far from the only one.","That’s why questions of illegality and terms-of-service violations are misleading. Even in the absence of violations, this sort of data collection is ubiquitous and omnivorous. Facebook would likely prefer the discussion to focus on questions of law, since United States data-sharing laws are quite lax, relying on “self-policing” by industry groups like the Network Advertising Initiative as a way to fend off actual legislation or regulation. European strategies like the “right to be forgotten” focus only on the publication of personal data rather than its initial collection—the very essence of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.","The problem, as law professor Frank Pasquale puts it in The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information, is “runaway data.” We are accustomed to thinking that once we share data with a particular entity—be it Google, Facebook, Amazon, or any one of thousands of shadowy data marketing firms—our data is somehow siloed there. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, firms are constantly sharing, selling, and coalescing data piecemeal in order to construct increasingly elaborate profiles of customers and citizens, and this data is frequently available in one form or another to anyone with the money to buy it. Entire companies like Interclick have been bought specifically for the hundreds of millions of demographic profiles they had accumulated.","If Cambridge Analytica hadn’t been able to get what it needed through Facebook, it could have gone to any number of other data brokers to get it, and then cross-referenced it to target Facebook users. If you’re a likely Trump voter, Facebook is not the only company with the evidence to prove it. Your credit card receipts, website habits, and demographic profile are frequently just as good, and there is no shortage of companies offering your data, without your permission.","Take Acxiom, a company which offers “Identity Resolution & People-Based Marketing.” In a series of articles in The New York Times, Natasha Singer explored how this veteran marketing technology company (founded in 1969) has profiled 500 million users, 10 times the 50 million that Facebook offered to Cambridge Analytica, and sells these “data products” in order to help marketers target customers based on interest, race, gender, political alignment, and more. WPP and GroupM’s “digital media platform” Xaxis has also claimed 500 million consumer profiles. Other marketing companies, like Qualia, track users across platforms and devices as they browse the web. There’s no sign-up or opt-in involved. These companies simply cyberstalk users en masse.","Even if Facebook were to seal off its data from the rest of the world, Cambridge Analytica could go to Acxiom, or any other company like it, to find the right voters and then locate them by name alone on Facebook (or elsewhere). How many of these companies would be able to tell the difference between an ordinary client using its data versus Cambridge Analytica, or even Russia? Once you’ve got a user’s data without their permission, most everything is on the table.","The only surprise is in how long it took for this data hydra to create havoc. Given the close margin of the election, it’s quite possible that Cambridge Analytica’s work (like so many other small factors) was enough to shift the election in Trump’s favor. The keys have been hanging from the door lock for over a decade, and few cared until now.","Facebook’s decision to suspend Cambridge Analytica now is little comfort. Notably, Facebook said nothing about preventing new companies from doing the same sorts of data harvesting and marketing. And even if Facebook did decide to sacrifice the revenue and somehow cut off all such activity, a peek inside Amazon, Google, Oracle, or Acxiom will reveal petabytes of similar personal data, ready to be shared, studied, and sold.","The internet was never designed for privacy, and between consumer profiling and government surveillance, there’s been little incentive to make it any more private. Cambridge Analytica’s work is not an aberration; it is an inevitability.","In 2013, I wrote of the growing threat not of Big Brother, but Big Salesman: For internet marketing companies, you are what you click. Big Salesman appears more innocuous when he’s marketing shoes and cars. Now that he’s marketing Donald Trump, we are beginning to wake up to his danger. With all our data out there, being gathered and sold by hundreds of companies, there will always be a Cambridge Analytica, a Steve Bannon, or a Vladimir Putin ready to make use of it.","David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that.","But Chris Hoofnagle, faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, said that legal language in the consent decree would make it difficult for the government to show that Facebook had violated the agreement, because it allows Facebook to give the information of a user’s friends to third-party developers."],"isopubdate":""}

And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.","Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.","Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.”","Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.","In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook’s terms of service, it deleted all of it.","Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act “and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.","Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, “the firm was effectively a shell” based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company’s role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.","The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","And yet as the firm sought to build “psychographic profiles” to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school’s Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users’ friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, “No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

From Facebook's description of the program:","With Partner Categories you can target people based on offline behaviors people take outside of Facebook, such as owning a home, being in the market for a new truck or being a loyal purchaser of a specific brand or product.","Facebook's Partner Categories offering was the result of a slew of data partnerships with companies such as Axiom and Oracle. These companies pull data from surveys, public records and store loyalty cards, among others.","This kind of ad targeting was useful, but doesn't make up the bulk of Facebook's ad business","While Partner Categories was useful to some brands, the majority of Facebook's advertisers' either employ Facebook's rich set of data on its users or their own data for ad targeting, according to ad buyers. Both of those targeting options are still available.","Generally speaking, Partner Categories appealed to big advertisers that don't have their own consumer data - like say packaged goods advertisers that primarily sell their products in stores, or car brands that sell via dealers.","Conversely, brands that sell directly to consumers - companies along the lines of Dollar Shave Club, Casper and Warby Parker - are less likely to need third-party data to run ad campaigns, since they collect their own data from their customers.","Also, it's important to note that while Facebook is taking away the option of using third-party data to target people with ads, marketers will still be able to use data from the Oracles of the world to measure the impact of campaigns.","In other words, a toothpaste brand will no longer be able to use third-party data to send ads to people who are frequent supermarket shoppers. But they will still be able to use data from these third parties to track whether ads on Facebook resulted in people buying their products in stores.","So this move is unlikely to cause Facebook's revenue to plunge overnight. But it could potentially frustrate many big advertisers, many of which are wrestling with how effective Facebook advertising is in the first place.","Facebook is embracing data populism","But Facebook clearly wants to be more conservative with its data. Or at least it wants to look like it is, as pressure mounts on the company to disclose what happened with Cambridge Analytica and the 2016 election.","\"We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,\" said Facebook product marketing director Graham Mudd in a statement. \"This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook.

But apparently, when you’re trying to win a campaign, prostitutes, bribes and spies work pretty well too.","On Monday, Britain’s Channel 4 News ran an explosive exposé of the embattled company. Going undercover as a potential client, its reporter filmed Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, talking about entrapping his clients’ opponents by sending “very beautiful” Ukranian sex workers to their homes. He spoke of offering bribes to candidates while secretly filming them and putting the footage online, of employing fake IDs and bogus websites. Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, described how the company “put information into the bloodstream of the internet” and then watched it spread.","This story came two days after a joint investigation by The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from over 50 million Facebook users without their permission. That, The Times wrote, “allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.”","After days of revelations, there’s still a lot we don’t know about Cambridge Analytica. But we’ve learned that an operation at the heart of Trump’s campaign was ethically nihilistic and quite possibly criminal in ways that even its harshest critics hadn’t suspected. That’s useful information. In weighing the credibility of various accusations made against the president, it’s good to know the depths to which the people around him are willing to sink.","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of the SCL Group, a British company that specialized in disinformation campaigns in the developing world. It’s mostly owned by the Mercer family, billionaire right-wing donors and strong Trump supporters. Before becoming the Trump campaign’s chief executive, Steve Bannon was Cambridge Analytica’s vice president. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., also served as an adviser to the company.","Cambridge Analytica shared office space with Trump’s San Antonio-based digital operation, and took substantial credit for its success. “We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communications played such an integral part in President-elect Donald Trump’s extraordinary win,” Nix said in a Nov. 9, 2016, news release.","It’s long been hard to judge how well psychographic profiling actually works. Many consider Cambridge Analytica overrated. Last year, BuzzFeed News reported that former employees said “that despite its sales pitch and public statements, it never provided any proof that the technique was effective or that the company had the ability to execute it on a large scale.” Those who feared that Cambridge Analytica was conducting information warfare on the American people may have been giving the company’s self-serving propaganda too much credence.","But whether or not Cambridge Analytica’s methodology works, the fact that the Trump campaign had a crew of high-tech dirty tricksters on its payroll is significant. We already know that Cambridge Analytica reached out to Julian Assange about finding and disseminating Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails. We know that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has asked the company to turn over documents related to the Trump campaign. Channel Four News plans to air additional undercover footage about Cambridge Analytica’s role in the Trump campaign on Tuesday.","At a minimum, we’ve learned that the Trump campaign’s vaunted social media program was built on deception. Shortly after the 2016 election, Forbes ran an article crediting Jared Kushner for his father-in-law’s shocking triumph. Thanks to digital tools, it said, the traditional presidential campaign was dead, “and Kushner, more than anyone not named Donald Trump, killed it.”","For those who knew something of Kushner’s pre-election career, this portrait of him as some sort of analytics genius was befuddling. The small, gossipy New York newspaper he’d owned, The New York Observer, didn’t even have a particularly good website. “He wasn’t tech-savvy at all,” Elizabeth Spiers, the paper’s former editor in chief, told me.","Cambridge Analytica’s corruption helps provide the missing piece in this story. If the Trump campaign had a social media advantage, one reason is that it hired a company that mined vast amounts of illicitly obtained data.","There’s a lesson here for our understanding of the Trump presidency. Trump and his lackeys have been waging their own sort of psychological warfare on the American majority that abhors them. On the one hand, they act like idiots. On the other, they won, which makes it seem as if they must possess some sort of occult genius. With each day, however, it’s clearer that the secret of Trump’s success is cheating. He, and those around him, don’t have to be better than their opponents because they’re willing to be so much worse."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace ‘big data’ – Facebook’s advertisement audience estimates – that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform’s over 2 billion users to measure and ‘nowcast’ digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining ‘online’ indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, ‘offline’ indicators related to a country’s overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps.

Among its marquee clients: President Donald Trump’s general election campaign.","Now a company known as much for reminders of a long-lost friend’s birthday and documentation of acquaintances’ every whim is grappling with outrage and the possible loss of confidence from users around the globe that have made the social media site a part of their daily routine.","“I trust somebody until they give me a reason not to trust them,” said Joseph Holt, who teaches business ethics at the University of Notre Dame. “And Facebook has increasingly given me reasons not to trust them.” Losing that would be a disaster, not just for Facebook, but for any Silicon Valley company that relies on users to open up their private lives.","The amount of trust placed in technology has soared. Cars sync with cell phones. Refrigerators know when there’s no more milk and reorder it. Virtual assistants field answers to nearly any inane question.","And with each turn of the steering wheel, sip of milk or request for dinner reservations, a trail of digital crumbs is left for companies to collect, analyse and profit off.","The public has largely been willing to accept the trade-off, knowing in exchange for giving up some data, Netflix will offer spot-on show suggestions, Ama­zon will prompt a diaper order and Google will figure out what to search before a user finishes typing it.","Not everyone understands the darker side of data brokers in an always-connected society.","Every time a person shops online or at a store, loyalty cards linked to phone numbers or email addresses can be linked to other databases that may have location data, home addresses and more. Voting records, job history, credit scores (remember the Equifax hack?) are constantly mixed, matched and traded by companies in ways regulators haven’t caught up with.","While Facebook let slip data profiles on millions of people, “it’s much more than that,” says James Grimmelmann, a professor at Cornell Law School. “Trying to pin down any one breach as being the source of all the privacy harms out there is futile.” For Facebook, whose power and value are built on being so ever-present in people’s lives, the impact has been immediate its share price is down nearly 14 per cent since the scandal broke March 16.","Investors fear that Facebook users will start to think twice before posting the latest snapshots of their puppy, or clicking “like” on a news story or movie trailer.","After the scandal broke, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologised, admitted his company’s mistakes and said security needs to be enhanced to protect users’ data. He noted that this is a major trust issue for the public.","It follows closely on the heels of the company acknowledging it helped spread fake news and propaganda from Russian-linked trolls disrupting the 2016 presidential election.","While some disenchanted Facebook users have deactivated their accounts, others point out that breaking up can be hard to do. If a credit card company or an airline’s data is breached, it’s easy enough to switch allegiances. But for most of Facebook’s 2 billion users there’s no real substitute, says Aaron Gordon, a partner at Schwartz Media Strategies, a Miami-based public relations and crisis management firm.","“It’s a lot harder to just up and leave,” he says. “So you go to Twitter or Instagram? It’s not the same.” (Besides, Instagram is owned by Facebook.)","Holt, the business ethics professor, loved Facebook, but with all that’s come out, he feels like he’s in an abusive relationship. He estimates he cut his usage from about 30 minutes daily to about 10 minutes every other day and would happily flee altogether if a viable alternative emerged that more zealously protected data.","“I haven’t left it yet, but I go less often and I feel less good about it,” he says.","Facebook is not the only company to deal with misuse of private information that has weakened public confidence. Equifax, the credit reporting agency, and Target, the retail giant, both suffered massive data breaches affecting tens of millions of people. Wells Fargo faced stiff government fines for a fake accounts scandal.","The public tends to get numb to this steady drumbeat of bad news, says brand strategist Rachel Brand.","“People pick their battles and daily outrage,” she says. “Facebook messed up royally, but most people are on a daily outrage roller-coaster and aren’t sure if this is the hill worth dying on.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

And they want them from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself. As CNBC reports, Damian Collins, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, sent Zuckerberg a letter today requesting that he appear before the committee to discuss Cambridge Analytica and Facebook's role in its data acquisition.","You can read more about the situation here. But to sum it up, a Cambridge University researcher developed a Facebook app that contained a personality test and though 270,000 took the test, Facebook's policies allowed the app to also collect data on many of those test-takers' Facebook friends as well. In all, the app collected Facebook profile information on around 50 million users and the researcher then handed that data over to Cambridge Analytica -- a political data analytics firm funded by the likes of billionaire Robert Mercer that aimed to use such data to better target ads and content to specific individuals. The company has been accused of using its methods during the US presidential election and the Brexit campaign.","In his letter, Collins says that Facebook's representatives have repeatedly understated the risks that go along with the way companies can acquire and hold on to Facebook user data. \"It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,\" writes Collins. \"There is a strong public interest test regarding user protection.

It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda,’ because the moment you think, ‘That’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”","The executives made it clear that they worked with former intelligence agents from MI5, MI6, and Mossad who would be able to secure secret or damaging information.","“We do incognito very well indeed, in fact we have many clients who never wish to have our relationship with them made public,” Nix said on the undercover film. “We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you.”","The campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5.9 million in 2016, beginning that July. Cambridge is part owned by wealthy Republican donors the Mercers and used to count former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon among its board members.","The new disclosures surfaced after a horror morning for Mark Zuckerberg saw $40 billion wiped off the value of Facebook.","Or Cambridge Analytica would set up hidden cameras and either catch the politician saying he would accept a bribe, or the company would send in girls to seduce them.","“We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know, you know what I’m saying,” he said. “They are very beautiful. I find that works very well.”","Aside from the promise of kompromat, the executives told their prospective clients that they knew exactly how voters were thinking because of their social media access.","“Our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else, to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns… It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion,” Turnbull said.","He said Cambridge Analytica had used a few hundred thousand people’s Facebook accounts to reach out and scale up through their social networks to touch “most of America.” The company used harvested information from the accounts’ friends’ profiles as well—updates, likes, and in some cases private messages.","Facebook denies that there was any data breach, saying its privacy systems are intact and that it expects other users of that data (such as people who operate apps on the site) to abide by the same rules.","Wylie said everyone does not abide by those guidelines, even though Aleksandr Kogan, SCL and Cambridge Analytica promised that they had destroyed the data.","Facebook was reportedly informed of this alleged breach two years ago but did not go public to announce that a political consultancy linked to Bannon and the Mercers had access to details from 50 million Facebook accounts.","Instead it reportedly threatened legal action against the publications who were working with Wylie and erased his Facebook and Instagram accounts.","Dubbing himself the #millennial #whistleblower, Wylie has since taken to Twitter to joke about being deprived of access to his “daily dose of well curated food pics and thirst traps.”","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman told Channel 4 News: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever… Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”","In February 2018, Nix appeared before the Culture Media and Sport select committee in the House of Commons in London and said: “We don’t work with Facebook data, we don’t have Facebook data.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign.

But those who joined the group soon found themselves puzzled. The admins often posted pro-gun information and unrelated memes and mocked those who posted about gun control.","“I'm a retired federal law enforcement special agent. There is and never has been any reason for a civilian to have a high-capacity high velocity weapon,” posted one member on Feb. 20.","“Shutup fed and stop trying to spread your NWO BS,” was the top reply, which came from one of the group’s admins. (NWO is a reference to the “new world order” conspiracy theory.)","A few days later the group’s name was changed to “Kim Jong Un Fan Club,” and members continued to wonder what was going on.","The simple answer is they were being trolled. The more complicated one is that while Facebook groups may offer a positive experience for millions of people around the world, they have also become a global honeypot of spam, fake news, conspiracies, health misinformation, harassment, hacking, trolling, scams, and other threats to users, according to reporting by BuzzFeed News, findings from researchers, and the recent indictment of 13 Russians for their alleged efforts to interfere in the US election.","“This vision could backfire terribly: an increase in the weight of ‘groups’ means reinforcement of Facebook’s worst features — cognitive bubbles — where users are kept in silos fueled by a torrent of fake news and extremism,” wrote Frederic Filloux, coauthor of the influential weekly media commentary newsletter Monday Note.","“Propagandists and spammers need to amass an audience, and groups serve that up on a platter. There’s no need to run an ad campaign to find people receptive to your message if you can simply join relevant groups and start posting,” she said.","To her point, the recent indictment of the 13 Russians repeatedly cited Facebook groups as a focus of workers at the Internet Research Agency.","“By 2016, the size of many organization-controlled groups had grown to hundreds of thousands of online followers,” the indictment said.","One part of the Russian effort on Facebook left unmentioned in the Mueller indictment — and that has not previously been reported — is that Facebook’s group recommendation system encouraged fans of troll-run pages such as Blactivist and Heart of Texas to organize themselves into groups based on their shared affinity for a page. To this day there remain many groups with automatically generated names such as “Friends Who Like Blacktivist” or “Friends Who Like Heart of Texas.” These groups appear to be small and inactive, but the fact remains that Facebook prompted Americans to organize into fan groups of Russian troll pages.","There’s no question that groups offer value to many Facebook users. They keep friends and former classmates close, and played a key role in helping organize the West Virginia teachers’ strike. They are the basis for a thriving global community of buy, sell, and barter networks. Groups were used to raise money for victims of the Las Vegas shooting, and help provide support to, and prevent suicide among, US military personnel. Facebook groups can restrict membership by being designated “secret” or “closed,” and as a result people often share deeply personal information and experiences because they feel protected from the prying eyes of search engines and the public at large.","That’s the case for Female IN, a secret Facebook group that today boasts a membership of more than 1.5 million women around the world. It was created by Lola Omolola, a Nigerian-born journalist now living in Chicago. She started it after more than 250 schoolgirls were kidnapped by a terrorist group in Nigeria. Many of the women in the group live in, or are originally from, African countries. But Omolola said it has grown to include women from other parts of the world.","Secret groups like FIN are completely invisible to anyone who is not a member, and Facebook users can only join if they are invited by a current member. This is different from closed groups, which can be found via search, show up on user profiles, and enable anyone to request to be added to the group.","“We discuss everything from everyday day stuff like your children, your healthcare, and your individual interactions with people. We go from there to talking about domestic violence. People are sharing in real time what happens at their homes,” Omolola told BuzzFeed News in an interview facilitated by Facebook’s PR team. “Generally we are very actively and thoughtfully healing a population of women who are used to being silenced, and whose voices have never really historically mean that much.”","But even a group that Facebook itself points to as an example of the product’s value has to wage a battle against bad actors. Omolola and other FIN admins work constantly to keep men and spammers out of the group. They have to warn members about imposter FIN groups on Facebook that try to leverage her group’s success and brand among women. A post to the public FIN Facebook page from last fall warned women of a “FAKE FIN run by A MAN!!!”","“Some people try to use the [FIN] name to get a lot of people to their groups,” Omolola said. “We have contacted Facebook and Facebook knows about it, and are working on ways to protect us.”","Omolola says she working on trademarking the group’s name so she can ask Facebook can enforce her trademark and take imposter groups down faster. Right now, it’s mostly up to her and her members to go into fake FIN groups and warn people that it’s a scam.","Jennifer Dulski, the head of groups and community at Facebook, told BuzzFeed News that there is now a dedicated “integrity” team for groups, which includes people who specialize in security, product, machine learning, and content moderation. She pointed to new tools launched last year that help admins screen and easily remove members, and that lets admins clearly state the rules of a given group on its About page. (Omolola said these new features are all big time savers.)","“There is some negative content and behavior happening on Facebook, including in groups, and we take that really seriously,” Dulski said.","She emphasized that the the experience for most users is positive.","“It’s amazing to see what is actually happening in Facebook groups, and the vast majority of of activity and content in these groups is not only positive but also meaningful for the people involved in them.”","DiResta sees a parallel, suggesting groups are at the same stage pages and the News Feed were prior to Facebook’s 2016 wake-up call about fake news: rife with manipulation and lacking proper oversight.","“We need to avoid a repeat of the kind of persuasive manipulation we saw on pages, so Facebook needs to be pay attention to these issues as they continue to increase their emphasis on groups,” DiResta said.","That emphasis on groups is now a cornerstone of Zuckerberg’s vision for the company and product. Last summer he announced an ambitious goal to drastically increase the number of Facebook users in “meaningful” groups from 100 to 1 billion.","“If we can do this, it will not only turn around the whole decline in community membership we've seen for decades, it will start to strengthen our social fabric and bring the world closer together,” he said in a speech at Facebook’s first Community Summit last summer.","But to get to a billion, Facebook will have to acknowledge and battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who constantly exploit, take over, and buy and sell groups in order to make money or sow chaos. It will also have to confront the fact that its own recommendation engine at times pushes users into conspiracy theorist groups, or into those geared toward trolling, harassment, or illicit online activity.","The global exploitation of groups","As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, members of a Facebook group called Republicans Suck suddenly experienced an influx of new members who spammed the group with links to questionable stories on websites they’d never heard of.","Bobby Ison, a Kentucky man who was member of the group, told BuzzFeed News that he noticed the administrators and moderators of the group began to change and “some of them were obvious foreign accounts. Eastern European countries. Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia.”","Ison said he and others learned that the Facebook account of one of the group’s original admins had been hacked. With control of the admin’s Facebook profile, the hackers were then able to add whoever they wanted as admins, and remove the group’s original leaders.","“When they got his [account], they booted the other admins, and moved more of theirs in,” Ison said. “It was rather sad to witness.” (The admin whose account Ison said was hacked did not respond to inquiries from BuzzFeed News.)","Eventually, former admins and members fled to start a new, closed group called","“As some of you know, the old REPUBLICANS SUCK has been hacked and taken over by hackers and trolls, which is something that is happening in several groups,” reads the pinned message for the group from one of its administrators.","Ison said the old group’s new overseas admins stepped up their spamming efforts in order to drive traffic from the group to their sites, presumably so they could earn ad revenue.","“It turned into a horrible page after they finally took over. Posting some of the most outlandish stories I've seen,” he said.","BuzzFeed News spoke via Facebook Messenger with one of the profiles currently listed as an admin of the group. That account has previously posted online about a Ford van for sale in Macedonia and written posts in Macedonian. Many of the account’s earliest posts in groups were for online moneymaking schemes. The person running the account said they were only added as an admin of the group two months earlier and didn't know anything about the group takeover last year.","“For the first time I hear from you that this group is stolen,” they wrote. They said they are not profiting in any way from the group. (BuzzFeed News could not confirm whether the profile’s name is linked to a real person.)","“We have no interest, we have no profit, we do not do with advertisements,” they said, and offered to make a BuzzFeed News reporter an admin of the group as a sign of goodwill.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups.\"","BuzzFeed News previously documented how political Facebook groups were exploited to spread political fake news to Americans during the 2016 election and beyond. An article published on Election Day revealed that Macedonian spammers used fake profiles to spam Trump and Bernie Sanders groups to generate engagement for their often false pro-Trump stories.","The tactic of spamming groups is by no means restricted to US politics or those targeting US audiences.","Rappler, an independent news website in the Philippines, last month published a story about a seemingly fake Facebook profile that spammed groups with links to websites that carried positive news about President Rodrigo Duterte. At one point the profile took over a fan group for a South Korean actor and changed its name to “President Duterte Supporters.”","Rappler found that the account posted hundreds of links to pro-Duterte news in Facebook groups since last summer. “She had also posted 307 times in various groups linking to a website called ‘Philippine Republic News’ which carries fake stories such as Oprah's support for President Duterte,” the story said.","A report on troll farms and fake news in the Philippines by two researchers included a case study showing that paid trolls tasked with helping win an election “came up with fake profiles and populated a Facebook group dedicated to the city they were trying to win.”","Facebook groups are also an engine of misinformation in Myanmar. Thura, a worker with a Myanmar social media research organisation, told BuzzFeed News by email that “Facebook groups are being used widely to spread hatred.” (BuzzFeed News agreed to conceal his identity due to security and safety concerns related to the work he does in Myanmar.)","Thura said people are using groups to spread hate and misinformation because they’re aware that less of the content posted to pages will reach the News Feed. So they focus on groups as a cheaper and more reliable way to reach people.","“Since Facebook pages do not normally go into News Feed unless they pay ads, groups are a good way to raise visibility of some of the fake news,” Thura wrote. “Groups are also a good strategy for [generating] engagement for a post from a page, meaning once a page posts a content, their network share them in several different groups.”","Spamming fake stories into groups is also the preferred tactic of American fake news publishers. Jestin Coler is a California man who ran more than a dozen early fake news sites such as National Report starting in 2013. He exited the fake news game last year and now says he’s focused on trying to use his experience to help battle online misinformation. Coler told BuzzFeed News that spamming groups was, and continues to be, a key traffic strategy for fake stories — and it’s still not being dealt with by Facebook.","“Joining Facebook groups that are related to the content being promoted, then spamming links throughout those groups using various aliases, is quite effective,” he said. “Members of the group then essentially become ‘bots’ and often share content to their network (outside of the group) creating a more organic-looking campaign.”","Coler said it was standard practice to identify specific Facebook groups related to the topic of a fake story and then join them all at once to enable link spamming.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups,” he said.","His lack of knowledge of American pop culture also caused him to share the link in a group dedicated to the TV show It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He apparently thought it was a group focused on the city. (He did not reply to requests for comment at the time.) One town in Kosovo is also home to a network of groups that spread fake news to Americans, according to a recent report by Media Matters.","Facebook’s intention to give even more visibility to group content in the News Feed will now make this tactic even more appealing. It could also result in more takeovers of groups. There’s evidence this is already happening.","Two weeks after Facebook announced its latest News Feed algorithm changes, former admins and members of “Mystic Fire Native Heart,” a group with tens of thousands of members, began posting to warn that it had been taken over by hackers from Eastern Europe.","Keyword squatting and targeted harassment","Another tactic that could become more frequent with the elevation of groups by Facebook is what researcher Joan Donovan calls “keyword squatting.” The group that changed its name to “March for Our Lives 2018 Official” in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is a perfect example. That group has over time gained tens of thousands of members thanks to the admins changing its title to different topical names that are likely to attract new members.","When Stephen Hawking died last week the group changed its name to “RIP STEPHEN HAWKING 2018” and as a result showed up as a top three result in a groups search for “stephen hawking.”","Facebook","“This is a feature that they have learned to leverage and you can imagine if they have learned to do it there are hundreds if not thousands of other groups changing the keyword weekly in order to get attention,” said Donovan, who leads the media manipulation project for the research institute Data & Society. (Facebook declined to comment on that group’s tactics.)","Thura said keyword squatting is a common tactic in Myanmar, too. People will start a Facebook group with a topic that has broad appeal and is not connected to news. Then, once it’s gained enough members, the admins switch its name and start sharing false stories.","“The strategy they used often is that they start with a different name and then once they have a large amount of users, they change it to a different name such as ‘Let’s Share News’ group,” Thura said.","Dulski, who oversees groups at Facebook, said the company has invested in new tools to enable group members to report content that may violate the terms of service, or a group’s specific rules.","“One is tool for members to report posts that might be violating the rules, and they can report this to the admins of the group and to Facebook,” she said. “This allows admins to quickly and easily review and keep bad content from appearing.”","In cases of hate speech or offensive content, Dilski said Facebook uses machine learning to automatically flag posts that may be violating the terms of service, regardless of whether people report it or not.","Thura said he and other have found it’s often pointless to flag content or complain to group admins about fake news since they’re often the ones spreading it.","There are in fact groups that exist solely to engage in activities that violate Facebook’s terms of service. One group, Republic of Kekistan, amassed more than 30,000 members before being removed by Facebook earlier this year. BuzzFeed News joined the group last year and watched as members coordinated online harassment campaigns, most of which were targeted at trans women and left-leaning Facebook pages. The group was also home to hate speech, such as a post where one member posted a photo of a handgun and asked, \"What kind of Muslim repellant do y'all carry?\"","Facebook","The process for planning raids was simple: One group member shared a link to a piece of content they didn’t agree with and added the word “raid” to signal like-minded members to flood the comments of the content in question with nasty, often hate-filled messages and other types of trolling. Some calls for raids went unnoticed by the rest of the group, but others funneled dozens of hateful comments to unsuspecting victims.","At one point, a post in the group asked members to “raid the comments” of a fundraising post for the family of Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed during the Charlottesville demonstrations last year. Another post encouraged members to post laughing reactions to a Facebook post about a trans teen who committed suicide (The group’s description page at one point warned members, “No raid posts allowed. The safety of the nation must be guarded against retaliatory attacks.” But it appeared that policy was enforced loosely, if at all.)","BuzzFeed News","Planning coordinated online attacks is against Facebook policy, but members of Republic of Kekistan seemingly stayed under Facebook’s radar and went unpunished for months. Sophie Labelle, a cartoonist from Montreal and a trans woman, was targeted last May. Labelle writes a web comic called Assigned Male and is the author of several comic books about being trans. Labelle told BuzzFeed News she’s used to the online harassment that comes with being a trans public figure, but this was an extreme case.","Trolls posted her home address online and she had to move. Labelle said her roommate, who’s also trans, felt threatened too. The trolls also targeted a bookstore hosting her launch and as a result it was canceled. (That raid worked out in Labelle's favor: the added attention helped her book sell out its first printing.)","“I feel pretty powerless. It’s kind of a given that when you show support to me it makes you a target,” she said.","Labelle said there are conspiracy theories about her online and even her readers are sometimes targeted if they leave a comment on one of her social media posts.","Labelle suspects Republic of Kekistan was behind the May harassment, but she does not know for sure. As payback, her supporters decided to band together to coordinate mass-reporting of the Facebook group for violating the platform’s terms of service, and Facebook eventually shut it down temporarily that same month. The group reemerged at some point after the ban and was active again as recently as January, according to an online archive. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about when and why Republic of Kekistan was taken offline.","A marketplace of black hat groups services","Groups have become attractive enough for both legitimate and bad actors that there’s now a flourishing online marketplace of apps and services related to exploiting them.","There are multiple software apps that can automate posting links in groups and also automate the process of joining groups and inviting other profiles into them. For a small fee, you can buy new members to make your group seem more popular than it is, pay to spam a link of your choosing in groups with large numbers of members to try to drive traffic, or hire someone to go into a group and capture the email addresses of members in order to enable further spamming and targeting.","All of the aforementioned services violate Facebook’s terms of service, but they are easily found with a simple online search, or by going to a freelancing site such as Fiverr. Many of these services are offered by people based in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India.","“Looking for a Facebook promotion expert to help you post and promote your products, services to millions of real and active Facebook group members ???” read one recent Fiverr ad. “Search no more.I am here to give you full expert service that will promote your ads or links to about 40 million real and active Facebook group members.”","To learn how these providers add hundreds or thousands of members to groups, BuzzFeed News purchased a total of 6,000 members for three groups it set up. One person on Fiverr charged $6 to provide 5,000 members for a group. BuzzFeed News then purchased two more sets of 500 members from different providers that were found by simply searching Google for “buy facebook group members.”","People all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","One company charged $25 to add 500 members that were located in the US or UK. Another charged just $6 for 500 members that were not accounts specifically based in those two countries. In each case the process was the same: After the order was placed BuzzFeed News was contacted by email or Facebook and told to make a specific Facebook profile an administrator of the group. Once done, the administrator began quickly adding other Facebook accounts to the group. Suddenly these newly created groups appeared more popular than they were, and were likely to show up higher in search results on Facebook.","The profiles added to the groups appeared to belong to real people, though a sampling of some of them found they were inactive for a year or two. The orders that did not specify US and UK profiles saw accounts added primarily from Bangladesh and India.","A man in Pakistan who helped fulfil one of the orders told BuzzFeed News in a Facebook Messenger chat that he could easily add large numbers of profiles to any group in a short amount of time.","“I do even 500,000 members in single group easily,” he said.","He said the accounts he adds to a group belong to real people. The key is that he controls many Facebook accounts that he uses to friend real people. Once two accounts are friends, Facebook easily allows one profile to add the other into a public group without requiring their permission. (In the case of closed and secret groups, the invited profile must accept the request.)","The result is that people all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","The man told BuzzFeed News he uses a computer programming script to automatically add members in batches of 500 to 700. If he does more than that at a time he risks being banned by Facebook. But that limit appears to do little to deter those selling group members. (Once he saw that the BuzzFeed News reporter had a verified Facebook profile he offered to pay to get profiles he controls verified.)","Facebook","Facebook groups themselves are also places to purchase black-hat online marketing services. BuzzFeed News joined a group dedicated to Google’s AdSense advertising network and saw a post from an admin that listed his services. One item for sale? Facebook groups.","“I have facebook trade and sell groups for sale 20k to 40k members,” he wrote.","Radicalization by the recommendation engine","DiResta, the security researcher, first saw the risks of groups in 2015 while researching health conspiracy content and communities on social networks. She joined anti-vaccine parenting groups on Facebook and watched as well-meaning parents became increasingly radicalized in their views of Western medicine. She also saw false and misleading links spread quickly within groups.","DiResta also documented how group members coordinated the sharing of specific links on Twitter and other platforms to create the impression of an outpouring of support for a specific point of view. “They didn’t have bots but they were effectively replicating the function of bots,” DiResta said. “They were using these groups to coordinate and spread these messages.”","Facebook’s recommendation system also began its own process of algorithmic radicalization. DiResta noticed that as her account became more involved in anti-vax groups Facebook shifted the kind of groups it recommended to her. She was soon being shown groups about chemtrails, fluoride conspiracies, and flat Earth. As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, Facebook suggested she join groups dedicated to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. DiResta calls it “radicalization via the recommendation engine.”","She provided two screenshots to BuzzFeed News, both taken in December 2016, that show Pizzagate group recommendations for her profile. The largest group being pitched had more than 12,000 members at the time.","Similarly, after BuzzFeed News joined the group dedicated to gaming and cheating AdSense, Facebook’s recommendation engine surfaced a list of groups dedicated to the same topics, as if to say, “We see you enjoy ad and click fraud. Try these groups to learn more.”","Facebook also uses data about groups membership to recommend new friends. At the same time that the groups recommendation engine can push people further to the fringe, Facebook will suggest new friends who reinforce these perspectives.","Another concern for DiResta is how secret groups are used to further the radicalization process. When she was researching the anti-vax community she found it was easy to join open and closed groups. But she soon discovered that people used secret groups to exchange the most sensitive information and even engage in illegal activity.","“People would go into a group and say, ‘Hey, I need to get a medical exemption [for vaccines] for my kid’ and someone would say, ‘Hang on, I’ll DM you.’ Then gradually they recruit you into a secret group,” she said. “There was a whole underground network of information sharing around which doctors to go to in order to get fraudulent medical exemptions.”","DiResta said Facebook must find a way to strike a balance between letting people search for and talk about the topics they want without actively radicalizing or polarizing them.","“People have a right to search for Pizzagate and join Pizzagate groups, yes,” she said. “But for Facebook to be continuously, proactively surfacing these types of groups to people, that I think is where the ethics of the recommender system is insufficiently developed right now.”","“At a minimum, it needs to be studying how often people respond to these suggestions, and how groups may be impacting polarization,” she said. “Only Facebook has this data.”","Tellingly, even those who are happily engaging in conspiracy theory groups on Facebook also express frustration with how the product is being exploited. Last month a member of the PizzagateUncompromised group (7,500 members) posted a warning.","Facebook","“The groups Exposing the Rothschilds and Pizzagate Exposed were hijacked,” he wrote.","It happened the same way that “Republicans Suck” and “Mystic Fire Native Heart” were taken over.","“It happens in a lot of groups,” replied one person. “Time to look for some good alternatives to FB imo.” ●"],"isopubdate":""}

You shouldn’t have to wade through complicated privacy settings in order to ensure that the companies with which you’ve entrusted your personal information are making reasonable, legal efforts to protect it. But Facebook has allowed third parties to violate user privacy on an unprecedented scale, and, while legislators and regulators scramble to understand the implications and put limits in place, users are left with the responsibility to make sure their profiles are properly configured.","Over the weekend, it became clear that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company, got access to more than 50 million Facebook users’ data in 2014. The data was overwhelmingly collected, shared, and stored without user consent. The scale of this violation of user privacy reflects how Facebook’s terms of service and API were structured at the time. Make no mistake: this was not a data breach. This was exactly how Facebook’s infrastructure was designed to work.","In addition to raising questions about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election, this news is a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks that users face when their personal information is captured, analyzed, indefinitely stored, and shared by a constellation of data brokers, marketers, and social media companies.","Tech companies can and should do more to protect users, including giving users far more control over what data is collected and how that data is used. That starts with meaningful transparency and allowing truly independent researchers—with no bottom line or corporate interest—access to work with, black-box test, and audit their systems. Finally, users need to be able to leave when a platform isn’t serving them — and take their data with them when they do.","Of course, you could choose to leave Facebook entirely, but for many that is not a viable solution, unfortunately. For now, if you’d like keep your data from going through Facebook’s API, you can take control of your privacy settings. Keep in mind that this disables ALL platform apps (like Farmville, Twitter, or Instagram) and you will not be able to log into sites using your Facebook login.","If disabling platform entirely is too much, there is another setting that can help: limiting the personal information accessible by apps that others use. By default, other people who can see your info can bring it with them when they use apps, and your info becomes available to those apps.

Those who have seen it told Digiday there are three main updates: The first allows advertisers to see how many unique people used the lens; the second captures how many people took a photo using the lens; and the third allows advertisers to measure whether the effect has driven the user to take a specific action such as purchase, add to basket, view a webpage or install an app.","According to an updated dashboard viewed by Digiday, an AR effect for one advertiser was used more than 100,000 times over an eight-week period, 75 percent of which were organic. The effect contributed to around 10,000 orders, half of which occurred within a seven-day window, according to the dashboard.","Until now, brands that tested AR on the social network have only been able to see how many times their effects were used and how many views they generated. Brands view the lack of measurement as a minor issue rather than a big barrier to funding an AR effect, given the modest outlay required to create an effect in the first place. An AR effect is effectively a post that the brand itself develops using tools in Facebook’s AR Studio, or the brand can hire an AR developer to make an effect. The effects are not, however, ad units in the way that Snapchat’s branded lenses are sold to advertisers.","AR lenses on Snapchat typically cost between $500,000 and $1 million per day media agency executives have previously said. Whereas sources close to Snapchat claim advertisers can incorporate lenses into their paid campaigns for as little as $40,000. Regardless, pricing is dependent on factors such as targeting criteria and the timing of the lens, making it more comparable to a media buy than the branded-content play Facebook has touted to advertisers. As pricey as Snapchat’s AR play is, brands are still buying the lenses, and people are still using them. Over half of 13- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are using AR on Snapchat every week, according to the most recent figures shared by Peter Sellis, Snap’s director of product management for monetization, at Advertising Week Europe on March 19. Sellis acknowledged the challenges with the technology, however, noting that Snapchat’s AR lenses only reach about 15 percent of the U.S. population, per an eMarketer report.","“That doesn’t sound like the type of reach we’re going to need as advertisers to get AR in front of [more] people,” said Sellis, stressing how the company is trying to make lenses more accessible and pointing to the launch of its Lens Studio in December as the way it would drive reach. Pitched as a self-serve toolkit, advertisers can upload creative assets and create AR lenses on their own, which — in theory — would be faster than if they relied on Snapchat’s development team. Since the studio launched in December, it has had more than 30,000 submissions to and more than 1 billion views on lenses.","“I don’t think of AR as something we’re still figuring out,” said Sellis. “This isn’t 2015 when we’re learning if vomiting rainbows are beating flower crowns.” He added that the launch of World Lenses last October encapsulated the shift, with the business now pushing AR lenses for nearly everything, whereas before, it just focused on those that could be overlaid onto someone’s face. “We have a lot of the world’s most sophisticated advertisers working with AR today to achieve results across the entire funnel,” Sellis said. “Some of the world’s most sophisticated advertisers like Netflix and King are using AR to drive subscribers and downloads and activations.”","Snap, which pioneered AR on social media, will no doubt have one eye on Facebook’s rival service. Facebook is aggressively attempting to catch up to Snapchat in AR, opening up its beta program at the turn of the year following its launch to a limited number of partners in April. Earlier this month, Facebook introduced a feature that allows AR effects to be shown within its camera app when the camera is pointed at certain objects like the poster for a new movie, for example."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Veteran VC Bill Davidow raised this issue more than a year ago using the lab rat metaphor.","He used Google and others as examples. Here’s what he said.","“And the new Google Maps is just the start. Google, Facebook, Twitter, retailers, and thousands of application developers are now positioned to keep users engaged on Web sites and program behaviors. That is, to operant condition them.”","Is this what ‘digital marketing’ is becoming? Interactive operant conditioning designed to ‘program behaviors’… behavioral programming not just to sell you something…but to keep you ‘hooked’ for the purpose of ‘lifetime customer value’ monetization.","Is digital skinner box marketing the latest incarnation of the 1-to-1 model being increasingly adopted by some in the new generation of digital marketers & growth hackers — Some who apparently have little or no institutional memory of or appreciation for permissions-based marketing?","Clearly that’s a big part of it. But there’s a lot more.","The now shaky edifice of digital skinner box marketing, as currently practiced on a broad (I would say industry-wide) basis, is propped up by 3 primary pillars. They are:","Pillar 1. Emotional manipulation as ‘strategy’.","And the emotional manipulation is always and often rationalized under the flag of ‘serving the customer’.","I’d argue that one can find better rationalizations at any well-attended meeting of Narcotics Anonymous or it’s TV proxy. ‘I sold meth because I had to pay my medical bills.’ Got it Walter White.","But here’s the thing. ‘emotional manipulation as strategy’ is not confined to Facebook. It’s now a widespread phenomenon practiced by CMOs and brand marketers around the world. See the Brandworks University ad below as an example of how this strategy is pitched to CMOs.","Pillar 2. The new ‘chief marketing technologist’ as that ‘man behind the strategy curtain’.","Bill Davidow really only scratched the surface in his largely ignored warnings from June 2013. The ‘chief marketing technologist’ trend is a case in point.","Today’s chief marketing technologist trend is all about the new crop of digital marketing ops platforms used to continuously ‘engage’ users of apps and web services and systematically move them through ‘the funnel’ while of course ‘reducing churn’. The chief marketing technologist wave even made it into the Harvard Business Review.","On the surface the ‘chief marketing technologist’ looks like strategic marketing progress in the digital age. But when you combine these powerful technologies with emotional manipulation as strategy—-you’re getting pretty close to something more than a few folks see as unethical.","And that’s not just me saying that. It’s that rash of headlines in the past 24 hours reacting to the Facebook A/B testing experiment. Headlines I would characterize more as ‘brand contagion’ for Facebook than brand building.","Facebook should have seen this reaction coming. The intelligence community has a word for this. They call it ‘blowback’. An unintended consequence that happens when an operation in the field goes sideways.","Here’s the upside. It’s an opportunity window for Facebook competitors to reposition themselves as ‘ethical online brands’ by publicly repudiating emotional manipulation as strategy—-especially when tightly coupled with ‘marketing technology’. Are you listening Marissa Mayer? Are you listening Satya Nadella? Are you listening branding and digital marketing agencies of record around the world? Are you ready to de-scroogle-ize your marketing strategy and capitalize on the skinner box marketing blowback that is coming to a brand near you? If you do, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised at the stampede of support and customer adoption.","Emotional manipulation as strategy and the chief marketing technologist toolset need fuel to power their behavioral marketing drone. That fuel is ‘big data’.","And not just any big data but the kind of big data that provides a 360 degree surround-sound view of the specimen in the digital skinner box, aka the consumer. The big data component of the skinner box data management model is now on the agenda at the big analyst firms. They call it ‘customer context’.","I suspect that what we might see soon is a new kind of subscription SaaS ‘customer context’ application along the lines of LifeLock in identity theft protection. Let’s call it BigDataBlowBack. It may already exist as a ‘profile protection’ as a service platform in some ethical developer’s roadmap.","With BigDataBlowback all interaction between me and the new world order of digital marketing skinner boxes (aka apps) proceeds through BigDataBlowback. It’s my new single-sign-on (SSO) provider, my new virtual IP address & location scrambler, and my new repository of frequent user ‘engagement’ points I get paid to let you target, re-target and monetize me as a carbon life form unit with ‘lifetime customer value’. It’s big data strategy applied by consumers for consumers, not big data applied by brands for brands. It’s the actual manifestation of what the skinner box marketers pay lip service to—-customer power.","I’m not holding my breath to see BigDataBlowback on the market anytime soon. With M&A valuations the way they’ve been going, it would probably get bought just to get shelved. They don’t call it shelving. They call it an ‘aqui-hire’. But if you’re out there working on it let me know. I’ll help you write the product requirements doc, tell your story, and line up a few ethical upstream partners to make it a reality.","Final Thoughts","As I’ve written before, the consumerization of IT does not and should not equal the consumerization of IT marketing. The anti-Facebook headlines should convince you of that. So here’s the obligatory takeaways that one needs in a 21st century blog post.","Takeaway 1: For B2B/B2D Players:","If your company is a B2B or B2D technology provider in the XaaS (anything as a service) world, you should run from digital skinner box marketing as fast as you can. And if you’re a marketing technology platform company with any brand association to skinner box marketing methodology—-you’re going to need a brand makeover sooner rather than later. The blowback is only going to grow, not subside. Get out in front of it.","Takeaway 2: For B2C Players & Brand Agencies","When everybody else zigs, you zag.

Was it you who chose to specifically exist in the one we call the Milky Way? And in this one particular galaxy composed of 400 billion stars and their systems, was it you who specifically wanted to exist in this particular solar system?","And in this solar system, was it you who chose planet earth amongst numerous other planets?","And on planet earth, was it your choice to come to life in this particular region, in Istanbul, a city adjoining the continents Asia and Europe?","02:06 In our mother’s womb, our father’s sperm unites with our mother’s egg and forms a single cell. This single cell contains a genetic code that is comprised of approximately 3 billion letters, an accumulation of genetic information which defines the position of your liver, your kidney, your heart, the neurons in your heart, the neurons in your intestines known as your “second brain”, how your brain will be formed…","05:48 Starting on the 29th day after conception, as all the organs are formed in the brain, the weight of the information that accumulates in the brain’s database makes the brain conceive itself as this physical formation, i.e. the body.","08:44 The brain starts taking in everything it hears from outside. In fact, this begins all the way back in the womb, the baby brain receives the information coming from outside, and stores it in its database.","11:46 The point is, if we are capable of receiving external data, if we can receive data shaped by the culture, traditions, and conditionings of our environment, then surely we must also be able to receive other forms of data based on research and study of other fields of knowledge.","14:45 During the formation of the brain, the spirit also forms within the brain. When the biological aspect of the brain stops functioning the energy aspect of the brain remains. This energy aspect is what we call the spirit...","20:04 If we can grasp this, we will understand that we are like data living in the brain’s world, and that data is called “human.”","23:10 The most important factor here is the monitoring of the incoming data by the frontal cortex. While the frontal cortex monitors functions such as the intellect, reason and logic to construct man’s awareness, there is also another region of the brain known as the epiphysis or the pineal gland.","27:40 Such reincarnation fairy tales have now become completely obsolete… Reincarnation is an old story, there is no such thing.","COPYRIGHT","Ahmed Hulusi's works are non-profit and copyright-free.

(NASDAQ: FB) stock was down more than 3 percent Monday afternoon after a 14-percent fall in the past two weeks. Facebook is dealing with fallout from its Cambridge Analytica data scandal, and Citron Research editor Andrew Left said in a Monday report that Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP) could suffer collateral damage.","Facebook will be forced to dial back third-party access to data, and the Canadian e-commerce platform will come out on the short end of the stick, Left said.","Popular Searches","Facebook and Instagram play a key role in the solutions that Shopify pitches to its entrepreneurs, he said.

Shopify offers the technology for businesses to sell on their own websites, in retail stores, on marketplaces like eBay and Amazon, and on social channels like Facebook and Pinterest,\" said spokeswoman Sheryl So.","\"The power of our platform is that we offer one interface for merchants to sell anywhere and everywhere. It's incorrect to say that our merchants' success is tied to Facebook and its data.

They also agreed to have their data, such as their home city and Facebook 'likes', collected for academic use.","But then-Analytica employee Wylie told the Observer, which broke the story, that the app also collected data belonging to Facebook friends of the users who signed up to the quiz, producing a pool of data of tens of millions of people.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,\" Wylie told the newspaper. \"And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"","Cambridge Analytica claimed it had deleted all the data shared by GSR when it discovered this information was collected in breach of Facebook's terms of service and had no reason to believe the data was obtained illegally.","\"In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,\" its statement read.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","On the eve of the story breaking, Facebook said it has banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform.","In explaining its decision, Facebook said that while Kogan obtained people's data legitimately, by then sharing that information with Cambridge Analytica he had \"lied\" to the company and broken platform rules about not sharing such information with third-parties. Kogan maintains he acted legally and had a \"close working relationship\" with Facebook, the Guardian reports.","Facebook learned of this violation in 2015 and subsequently removed the app from its platform. It also \"demanded certifications\" from Kogan, Wylie and Cambridge Analytica that they had deleted the data.","However, while Wylie said he received a letter from Facebook lawyers in August 2016 to this effect, he claimed they never followed up to verify the data was deleted.","\"That to me was the most astonishing thing,\" he said. \"They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted.

While the journalists are expressing great shock, the people in the IT community are not really surprised. Facebook has been doing this for years and this is why browser extensions like Disconnect exist. Most of these extensions are third-party created extensions and work on a number of web browsers.","But this time, web browser giant Mozilla has come forward with a new extension called Facebook Container for the Mozilla Firefox web browser. This new extension makes good use of the relatively new Firefox extension called Multi-Account Containers. Using the containers in Firefox, you can isolate your various accounts and use them as if you are using a completely new instance of the web browser. The new extension (Facebook Container) is designed to create a special container for Facebook and isolate it from the rest of the websites that you access.","After the installation of the Facebook Container extension in Firefox, you won’t notice anything except when you access Facebook. The tab in which you open Facebook and the address bar turn blue indicating that Facebook is being isolated in a container. This also means that if you any website uses Facebook elements (like buttons, comments or sign-in using Facebook account) then these elements won’t work at all or won’t work as expected.","Mozilla has given a good reason for the creation of this extension – why stop using Facebook when you can isolate it and stop it from tracking you. But I think, they just wanted to show off some of the powerful features of the immensely popular Firefox web browser. In any case, it is working as intended and is keeping Facebook from tracking you."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

{"originalurl":"https://russia-insider.com/en/node/22874#.WrqXIQ36PX0.twitter","title":"Facebook, Not Russia, Helped Trump Win the 2016 Election (Cambridge Analytica)","text":["This story is seriously a year old, and although I was not the first journalist to write about this, I did bring it to the attention of about 6,300+ readers. While it is new that we have a whistleblower, and the number “50 million accounts”, what the media isn’t telling you is how Cambridge Analytica actually pulled this off.","The fact of the matter is the data that Cambridge Analytica acquired from Facebook, much of which they obtained legally and as Facebook intended them to, was entirely useless without machine learning. Machine learning is one of the baby steps required for building artificial intelligence, it is a field of computer science that gives computer systems the ability to “learn” with data without being programmed by a person. It was this technology that Cambridge Analytica used to analyze tens of millions of users profiles using data they acquired from Facebook, and put together psychological profiles of users. They then used Facebook’s targeted advertising system to display ads and content at those users geared towards their own psychological profile. Think of it as persuasive arguing on steroids hyper targeted by your own beliefs about the world.","For example, I let Cambridge Analytica analyze my data and they pegged me as a liberal. I know this may be a shocking revelation to all of my haters who believe I’m a conservative Russian agent conspiracy theorist who sells tinfoil hats for a living, but according to my Facebook data I’m a liberal. They also determined I’m more intelligent than 96% of Facebook users, and I somehow lost inteligence points because I like the Beatles (mostly a John Lennon fan), but that is a subject for an entirely different article.","What this means is Cambridge Analytica knows I am probably not going to vote for Trump based on my psychological profile. However, that is actually more valuable to them than not. There is little point to spending advertising dollars on people who you know will vote for your candidate, the person you want to target is actually the person who will not vote for your candidate and instead convince them to not vote. This is what I believe Cambridge Analytica did, I believe they targeted liberals in swing states and promoted anti-Hillary content in an attempt to convince people not to vote. It means they had to target fewer people, spend less money, and ultimately accomplish their goal of winning the election.","All Cambridge Analytica had to do was figure out who was a liberal, and convince them not to show up on election day. By doing so they could ignore everyone who couldn’t vote for whatever reason, and only spend a small portion of their budget on making sure Trump supporters showed up to vote. A no-vote was actually more powerful in swing states, where guess what? Liberal voter turnout was lower for Hillary than it was for Obama. Granted, I still think Hillary blew it and didn’t campaign properly. I am not excusing her ineptitude, she was a horrible candidate and I did not vote for her (Yes, I voted for the female doctor instead, and no I don’t regret it, lets just not talk about it, okay?).","Perhaps this is a just a giant coincidence, but I don’t think it is. Given Donald Trump’s ad spend, I’m fairly certain this is exactly what happened. The reason I believe this is because if I were hired to help win an election and had the tools and data Cambridge Analytica had, it is exactly what I would do. I don’t have anything to prove my theory unfortunately, but given what is being reported I am fairly certain I am on to something, and first came up with this theory a year ago before the media went into freak out mode.","This is why psychological profiling, privacy, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is so frightening when put in the wrong hands. It isn’t the machines we need to fear, it is the people who are in control of those machines and our data that we need to worry about. Machines are just tools, but people are fickle and with the right incentive easily corrupted.","Facebook, Not Russia, Helped Trump Win The Election","We know from Wikileaks that John Podesta was in touch with Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, and even thanked her for helping them “elect the first woman President of the United States.” However, Hillary didn’t win despite the fact Facebook was trying to get her elected alongside Google who was censoring search results, possibly running their own bots, and Twitter who was censoring the truth and purposely hiding Wikileaks tweets which are 100% factual (as they later admitted to congress).","The reason Hillary Clinton did not win despite the media and social media companies doing everything they could to rig the election in her favor is because Facebook double dipped and allowed Cambridge Analytica to use their surveying tools to collect user data on tens of millions of users. This data was then used to target tens of millions of users with political advertising using Facebook’s ad platform based on psycholgoical profiles from data they bought or acquired from Facebook.","Facebook is basically responsible for feeding the analytics system that enabled Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign to be so targeted and effective with a minimal budget. They ultimately won Donald Trump the swing states and the election. As well as subverted democracy, and likely made Facebook a bunch of money.","That’s what happened, that’s how Trump won. It wasn’t the Russians, it was our own social media companies who sold our data to the Trump campaign which they then likely used to convince liberals not to vote in swing states. It’s both horrifying, and cleverly brilliant at the same time."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","“For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. “I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen’s rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I’ll settle for 2018.”","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama’s 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google’s dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized “the right to be forgotten,” allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there’s no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany’s use of personal information to target Jews hasn’t been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today’s world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","“The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,” said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU’s new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking “I Agree.” The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there’s the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn’t legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it’s too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to “bracket off” European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn’t go down well in Europe.","“Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,” she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. “We’ve built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,” it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone’s data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","“Cambridge Analytica’s story sounds like a spy novel,” he said. “It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,” he said. “We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.’","In this piece, first published shortly after Donald Trump was elected president, writer McKenzie Funk challenged Facebook to do something about a firm that helped him win, Cambridge Analytica. Sixteen months later, Facebook has banned them. https://t.co/2oecalLUIR","The firm was backed by an investment of $15 million dollars from Trump supporter and Breitbart owner Robert Mercer, who was a crucial part of Trump’s election. Wylie explained the reasoning behind the alleged illegal activity.","‘They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.’","Previous reporting by The Wall Street Journal exposed Cambridge Analytica for their contacts with Julian Assange, whose role in the 2016 elections cannot be understated.

Journalists referred to the ways in which Russia “manipulated social-media platforms,” and tech company executives like Facebook’s Rob Goldman decried “how the Russians abused our system.”","WIRED OPINION","ABOUT","Joshua Geltzer is executive director and visiting professor of law at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection as well as an ASU Future of War fellow at New America writing a book on the issues discussed here. From 2015 to 2017 he served as senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council.","This is standard fare. When Russia manipulates elections via Facebook, or ISIS recruits followers on Twitter, or racist landlords deny rentals to blacks and then offer them to whites through Airbnb, commentators and companies describe these activities as “manipulation” or “abuse” of today’s ubiquitous websites and apps. The impulse is to portray this odious behavior as a strange, unpredictable, and peripheral contortion of the platforms.","But it’s not. It’s simply using those platforms as designed.","Twitter’s mission statement speaks of sharing ideas and demolishing barriers: “To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.”","It’s no surprise, then, that ISIS was drawn to Twitter’s ability to share news about demolishing a different type of barrier. When the terrorist group startled the world in 2014 by sweeping through much of Syria and then pushing into Iraq, its key moment occurred on Twitter, as ISIS tweeted photographs of a bulldozer demolishing the earthen barrier that had long marked the border between Syria and Iraq.","Twitter later said that ISIS’s use “is not permitted on our service,” and that may be true as a matter of policy—but not as a matter of functionality. As ISIS used Twitter to break down barriers and share its own horrific ideas instantly and anonymously, ISIS wasn’t manipulating how Twitter works. It was using it precisely as designed: to share ideas rapidly and globally.","“Belong anywhere” is Airbnb’s motto. But it turns out there are some who don’t think that just anyone deserves to belong anywhere. A 2016 study revealed that would-be renters with white-sounding names booked successfully on Airbnb 50 percent of the time, compared to 42 percent for would-be renters with black-sounding names.","In response, Airbnb commissioned a report that concluded that “fighting discrimination is fundamental to the company’s mission.” But what’s actually fundamental to the company’s mission is fighting virtually any form of regulation. That’s what maximizes Airbnb’s profits; it’s also what gives the platform essentially a free pass from decades of legal and regulatory infrastructure carefully crafted to fight housing discrimination.","For racist landlords to have unfettered discretion to pick and choose renters based on any criteria whatsoever—even skin color as it appears in profile photos—isn’t an exploitation of Airbnb’s features. It’s just use of those particular features—which Airbnb has subsequently altered in some ways but generally has chosen to maintain.","And that brings us back to what Mueller’s charges reveal about how Russia used Facebook, among other platforms, to interfere with the 2016 election and sow discord among Americans. As Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, told the New York Times, “Facebook built incredibly effective tools which let Russia profile citizens here in the U.S. and figure out how to manipulate us. Facebook, essentially, gave them everything they needed.”","For example, the type of polarizing ads that Facebook admits Russia’s Internet Research Agency purchased get rewarded by Facebook’s undisclosed algorithm for provoking user engagement. And Facebook aggressively markets the microtargeting that Russia utilized to pit Americans against each other on divisive social and political issues. Russia didn’t abuse Facebook—it simply used Facebook.","Recognizing that these challenges—and others—emerging on modern communications platforms stem from their inherent features isn’t an indictment of the companies whose services we’ve all come to rely on; to the contrary, it shows just how hard these problems are. And it calls for a reorientation as to how the companies and the rest of us think about addressing these challenges.","First, if companies would show the world how their algorithms operate—and, moreover, how malicious actors are using their platforms—that enhanced transparency could yield crowd-sourced solutions rather than leaving remedies to a tiny set of engineers, lawyers, and policy officials employed by the companies themselves.","Second, tech companies should at least experiment with bolder approaches to restricting malicious actors’ access to their services. So far, companies’ policies proscribe use by ISIS and certain other malicious actors, but in practice everyone can use the companies’ services unless and until another user complains about certain behavior and the company investigates and validates the complaint.","That default could potentially be flipped for a narrow category of really bad actors. In an era of machine learning, activity that readily appears to be malicious—mimicking closely, for example, the ways in which Russian trolls or ISIS has behaved in the past—could be halted automatically, at least initially. Then, humans could review expeditiously that “hold” to determine whether any accounts were improperly halted and, where appropriate, promptly reverse the suspension.","That would represent a huge shift in how companies approach use of their platforms; but, at least as an experiment, it would take seriously the increasing demand for spotting and halting bad actors before they can post radicalizing content or ensure that their socially divisive messages go viral.","LEARN MORE","The standard line that these challenges represent peripheral exploitations of these platforms yields hope that they can be addressed by strictly technical, engineering solutions, such as Facebook’s recent announcement that it would recalibrate the algorithm driving its News Feed. As the author of a report commissioned by Airbnb about discrimination on the platform phrases it, “Just as teams of lawyers were assembled to fight discrimination in the mid-20th century, it is my hope that 21st century engineers will do their part to help eliminate bias.” That might suffice if these were truly marginal manipulations of today’s technologies.","But they’re not. Because these are core features of the technologies being used by a few bad actors for some bad ends, these challenges ultimately aren’t susceptible to technical solutions alone. Addressing them ultimately demands “turning off”—or making unavailable—core product features for users abhorrent enough not to deserve access to them. Figuring out which users fall into that category is a value judgment—the type of value judgment that the libertarian ethos of tech companies has left them very reluctant to make.","The engineers will have their role to play in the twenty-first century, but so will the lawyers—and the policy wonks, and the ethicists, and perhaps even the moral philosophers. Because, ultimately, these problems stem not from the platforms’ glitches but from their very features. But, through enhanced transparency and a willingness to experiment with how to address malicious actors’ access to their services, the companies can enlist the rest of us to offer informed help and feedback, too.","WIRED Opinion publishes pieces written by outside contributors and represents a wide range of viewpoints.

But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","In December, special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s role in the 2016 election, asked Cambridge Analytica to turn over documents concerning the campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-09-19"}

At the same time, a whistleblower has said that Cambridge Analytica illegally harvested data from 50 million users.","Facebook announced on Saturday that it had suspended the data research firm Cambridge Analytica for holding onto dubiously obtained user data after assuring the social media firm that the information had been deleted.","Cambridge Analytica has become well-known in political circles for its work on the election campaign of US President Donald Trump and for the pro-Brexit group Leave.eu. Facebook said it was also suspending the firm's parent company, Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL).","The incident revolves around an app put on the site in 2015 by Aleksandr Kogan, a professor at the University of Cambridge, that purported to be a personality test and psychological research tool. About 270,000 users downloaded it and shared their information with it, according to Facebook.","Co-founder: We exploited 'inner demons'","But even more damning to Facebook were revelations published by The New York Times and Britain's The Observer that Cambridge Analytica had \"harvested data from 50 million accounts.\"","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" said the firm's co-founder, Christopher Wylie, in an interview with The Observer. He is no longer with the firm.","Despite stringent denials about the importance of their business relationship from both Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign, Wylie described the firm's mining of personal data as \"pivotal\" to Trump's victory to the UK's Channel 4 News.","'Kogan lied to us'","\"In 2015, we learned that ... Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe,\" said Facebook Vice President Paul Grewal.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" he added.","Kogan has also been suspended from the social media platform, as has Wylie. Facebook has not yet commented on Wylie's allegations.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information,\" according to Grewal, who promised to hold all parties \"accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing, saying that although it had hired Kogan to carry out research, it deleted his information when they learned it had been obtained under suspicious circumstances.

Perhaps he was operating with more knowledge than available to the general public and national pollsters? I wonder how involved he was with CA for the purpose of the election. His $1.25 million donation in October 2016 seems even more interesting in light of all this.","I took out a bet on Trump when Thiel became open with his support. It was driven by my belief that he was operating with deeper knowledge about the state of the nation precisely due to his association with Palantir (mostly) and Facebook. I feel dirty about winning that one.","I've always thought of it in terms of asymmetric risk – something Thiel seems to have a preternatural intuition for. In other words, what he stood to gain with a Trump win far outweighed what he stood to lose with a Trump loss. Most business leaders were throwing in with Clinton. If Thiel had done the same, and Clinton won, he'd be one voice in a crowded field. By being one of the few to publicly back Trump, he all but guaranteed a prime seat at the table. This is exactly what played out post-election, with Thiel ushering in tech leaders in the lobby of Trump Tower.","Had Trump lost, Thiel would have probably diminished his standing with the Clinton administration significantly. But, due to the crowded field, it would have been a small standing to begin with.","And here's the crux: Thiel has held controversial opinions for a while. He probably figured his association with Trump wouldn't really move the dial on his likability much, and he seems to enjoy being contrarian anyway.","So, anyway, there's my theory. Risk asymmetry. A lot to gain in the event of a Trump win, little to lose in the event of a Trump loss.","I don't think thiel and palantir would have lost that much if Clinton won. If the bulk of palantir revenue comes from DoD and intelligence community (IC) contracts, he cares about whoever will increase the DoD budget in general. No matter whether it is Bush or Trump or Reagan, a republican president almost always increases defense and IC spending and green lights new toys for them to play with. Defense contractors who don't care about Democrat or republican ideology simply care about their bottom line.","True that the Republicans usually increase defense/IC spending, but the Democrats support them just as much. Feinstein is almost always pro IC operations. Clinton pushed for US involvement in Libya and Syria, and in a speech before the Democratic Convention was sabre rattling at China. Clinton also, according to Seymour Hersh, was aware of CIA gun running operations out of the US consulate in Benghazi. Obama's support for DoD/IC activities should be common knowledge.","Not making a partisan argument, as I don't affiliate with either party, just stating that both sides exhibit support for DoD/IC activities and both were likely to support equal, if not increased, levels of spending on them","I have a simpler thesis. Is it possible that Thiel isn't particularly brilliant about politics? I mean I realize that he's rich and therefore he has to be smart about everything, but... maybe this isn't his field?","It could be that, like many right-wingers or libertarians, he saw in Trump an opportunity to break with the status quo and had the vague impression he'd get the things he wanted, or could manipulate Trump in the right direction.","But has Thiel personally profited in any way from this? He's reviled in Silicon Valley, and the Trump association hasn't obviously brought him anything new.","Have Thiel's ideological priorities been satisfied? He's known for being a hard libertarian, and he supported a man who was openly nativist and who has implemented tariffs. Failure on that score.","Thiel seems like a fairly callous person when it comes to race (as a student, he backed apartheid[1]). Trump may be more aligned with him there.","An analogy to this is why \"bad boys\" tend to do well at the dating game....","A Biker/Gang Member may not be attractive to most people, but to the portion of the population that prefer someone like that, they have much fewer anti-social males to choose from, and those individuals can do well at the bar.","> Am I the only one who thinks Thiel was just being true to his Libertarian views and wanted to","Given Trump's blatant admiration for authoritarians and authoritarianism, I'm skeptical that Thiel's support had anything to do with libertarianism.","Indeed, given Thiel's founding and constant promotion of Palantir (which feeds at the trough of the military-industrial complex and government contracts), I'm skeptical that he makes many life decisions based on libertarian principles.","Part of the problem is a confusion between raw poll results—where 59-41 means almost certain victory to one side—and statistical likelihood.","On election night, Fivethirtyeight gave Trump a 29 percent chance of winning the electoral college. Not a 71-29 poll result, a nearly three-in-ten chance of winning. Let that sink in for a second, and reevaluate the media narrative that the pollsters got it wrong.","When you take a bet, you play the odds. You evaluate your expected return should you take many such bets, and if it's positive and you can afford to lose, the smart money is in taking the bet.","In fact this is true of most anything you do in life - when you drove to work this morning you played the odds and the wager was your life against your salary. I'm sure you didn't think about it that way, but you took the bet","D.C. is usually counted as a state in discussion of Presidential elections since it was alotted electors under the 23rd Amendment. (This actually comports with a common practice in federal statute law where any of the federal territories that are treated equal to a state in the particular law are simply lumped into the law’s particular definition of “state”, which is then used to refer to actual stated plus the equivalent-to-state territories in the context of that law.)","The national party apparatuses should be able to find a way to have moderating voices. Most large cities in the U.S. are a one party system dominated by Democrats. Yet if you look at the politicians who are mayors and council members, there's a lot of diversity in ideas and bitter policy disputes.","Let's not turn this in to a pointless political debate. But stories such as the Republican appointee to the DoI saying \"diversity isn't important\" [0] lead some people to conclude that there's effort to cast other goals as more important than diversity. There are enough threads on HN debating the relative merits of diversity and meritocracy that there's no need to add them here, but this is just an answer to the citation request.","We should be looking for the individuals that will most improve the organization. That may mean hiring someone adequate today instead of someone spectacular who can start in 3 months. That could also mean choosing someone with a different background to most people in the organization. People with different backgrounds will have different biases and think about things differently. Having multiple perspectives is valuable in many organizations.","This is the bailey in the motte-and-bailey defense of diversity. Of course people from different backgrounds will contribute differing perspectives. But in practice, it always ends up being race, gender, and sexual orientation. No talk about getting representatives from groups that actually think in ways that are different. Where are the quotas for libertarians, green party members, immigrants, aspies, former attorneys, artists, competitive athletes, scoutmasters, stamp collectors, gearheads, all shades of personality types?","Spot on. While the idea behind can be interesting, it is implemented by accepting people who have the same \"social status\" background (same schools, same opinions), but are of different gender/race.","I think that a white factory worker could add way more insight into how other communities views things, than hiring a black/female attorney does...","Having said that, I'm really afraid what the backlash against this type of diversity-thinking will be. The system will surely corrects itself in the future (it's already starting), but I'm not certain going back to another extreme would be very wise...","> Our country is so polarized that pretty much all elections are close.","I assume you mean pretty much all Presidential elections (because otherwise it's not true; lots of elections aren't close, and some electoral districts are so structurally guaranteed to be not close that elections are usually uncontested), but even then polarization does nothing to explain that, but the incentive to seek a winning coalition with minimal compromise on issues in a two-party system does.","Imagine you train an algorithm to influence the voters to\nwin the election. What would be the objective ?\nMaximize the probability that your candidate wins.\nThis does not imply winning the popular vote, nor maximizing the margin of the electoral vote.","Thiel went with Trump for standard VC reasons: because it was a low-cost, low-odds, high-reward play on an unpopular undervalued asset. Also because Trump fits his \"maverick\" style of operating independently outside of the big establishment machines.","If Trump lost Thiel would move along to doing the best he could with the winners, who wouldn't have a reason to shun him for irrelevant past actions.","Parent comment probably means access to the administration and administration supporters for Thiel and related companies. Much easier to be a voice in a room of 10 people than a voice in a room of 1000. Trump and his picks were more likely to support large defence projects and big business operations that Palantir could profit from.","I just want to point out that what you're talking about here is corruption. To restate: For someone in Thiel's position, the upside to supporting a particular political candidate is the expectation that he will benefit from corruption while that candidate is in office. Everyone knows this but I believe it is worth being explicit about it from time to time. (I don't mean this as a dig against the party or even the person currently occupying the Presidency; this cuts both ways.)","Argh, enough. Cambridge Analytica and friends didn't have secret knowledge. People need to stop lifting up these big data woo casters and weigh their impact on the election beyond their actual ability.","Machine learning/machine vision just killed a person on a well lit street. You people need to calm down on the thinking that Silicon Valley data scientists have figured out everything others haven't other than how to boost ad dollars (and even that is in dispute as recent articles on Hacker News have pointed out.)","> I wonder how confident Thiel was of a Trump presidency back in May 2016","Well how many other companies are there with the capabilities of Palantir? If the answer was \"none\" then he knew for sure the Clinton campaign couldn't match Trump on social media manipulation. Which means he must have been pretty confident","Eric Schmidt was a big Clinton supporter and I believe helped with her tech campaign. If the chain of events from Nix->Sophie Schmidt->Eric Schmidt->Thiel/Palantir is true then I don't know how the concern wouldn't have been raised to Clinton. I think the real question is what did FB know and when did they know it. Thiel being on the FB board and all. It's also weird that the What's App guy is on the board and just called for everyone to #deletefacebook.","If all it takes is being a \"better\" psychopath along with an organization lead by psychopaths that only care about popularity and not truth, then with initial testing for calculations - they likely had a very good idea what would happen once they added fuel to the fire.","It's possible that Thiel knew something deeper about the state of the nation through Palantir. However, I seriously doubt that Palantir secretly worked on the data that Kogan sold to CA years after he collected it, as this Wylie guy alleges. He has presented no evidence, and Palantir flatly denies it. I think he has seen the media run with his previous claims, and thinks that nobody will call BS on him now.","I have started wondering what could be driving this guy to make what at first seemed like believable allegations, that now seem more and more wild. I have been unable to find any current employer for him. My suspicion is that he is out of work and thought the attention from this would get him hired somewhere, not realizing that nobody - even the most liberal of firms - will hire him because he has proven, in the most public of ways, that he can't be trusted to not disclose confidential information.","According to [1], he is a dyslexic high school dropout with ADHD who sued his elementary school because he was bullied and \"...he describes himself as the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating \"Steve Bannon's psychological warfare mindf--k tool.\" That is certainly a grandiose claim, but there seems to be no evidence that this tool even worked, and in fact there is some evidence to the contrary [2]. It appears that campaigns hired CA not because its data analysis techniques were helpful, but because doing so was a prerequisite for obtaining campaign contributions from the Mercer family [3].","So, we have an out of work programmer with social issues who has no degree and can't be trusted, whose most famous work apparently didn't work at all (according to its customers), and whose biggest asset is that the media will take everything he says as fact. My guess is that Wylie's claims will get even more bizarre as he and his stories quickly disappear from the headlines with no work forthcoming.","First of all, a significant part your comment is ad hominem. For example, bringing up his dyslexia and sexuality in the context of his credibility does no credit to your argument.","More importantly, some very big players have decided that Wylie is very credible. Channel 4's investigation, which featured Cambridge Analytica's CEO bragging about conducting campaign bribery and blackmail on camera, was based primarily upon his whistleblowing to The Guardian's Carole Cadwalladr. Britain's libel laws are quite strict, so Wylie was extensively vetted before Guardian was confident enough to publish without fear of being sued. And Channel 4 approved the undercover investigation of CA on the basis of Wylie's information. Also, with these kinds of blockbuster investigative reports, the legal department gets involved in vetting whistleblowers.","Based on all this, along with Wylie's testimony to parliament today, as well as his willingness to testify under oath to the US Congress, I'd say his credibility is quite high unless specifically proven otherwise.","Bringing up his dyslexia and sexuality in the context of his credibility does no credit to your argument.","I pasted his own quote. That is how he describes himself in the media. That is the only reason I found it relevant - because he found it relevant. In the quote I copied, he also said that he is both Canadian and a vegan, but somehow you didn’t take issue with that. Is it now not PC to copy and paste exact quotes from people? The rules change so often...I can’t keep up.","With regard to the rest of your comment, again, my comment was in response to his Palantir claim. Did he present any evidence of his Palantir claim?","> Is it now not PC to copy and paste exact quotes from people? The rules change so often...I can’t keep up.","You brought it up in the context of questioning his motives and credibility. By the way, I'm a big admirer of folks like Jonathan Haidt and Jordan Peterson, just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from. I hate PC. But I also can't stand ad hominem attacks, and a very significant part of your comment discussed things that have no bearing on your argument.","> With regard to the rest of your comment, again, my comment was in response to his Palantir claim. Did he present any evidence of his Palantir claim?","There's turned out to be a ton of evidence to back up his Cambridge Analytica claims. And his Palantir claims just came out today. On the basis of those two facts alone, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. If he's lying, I'm sure it will come out. But I'm skeptical he's making this all up.","Because all of those factors add up to someone desperate for attention that would do anything for it. That speaks to credibility. Further, suing a school for bullying...something that millions of people experience...is a bit out of the ordinary is it not? What percentage of school children do that? It shows a certain hunger for money and attention, from a very young age, that others don’t have.","At 3:01 in the hearing, they get into a discussion regarding Wylie pitching the company he was at in January, 2016, to the VoteLeave people (but not being accepted). Wylie was doing something in Canada at the time though.","And CA was introduced to Palantir by none other than Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of one Eric Schmidt. It’s turtles all the way down, and anyone who thinks their private data is not being abused elsewhere (wink, wink) needs to perhaps think again.","I worked at a small Beltway Bandit-style federal contracting firm. The CEO bragged to me that he was the Democrat and his wife was the Republican in their relationship. His wife gave to Republican candidates. He gave to Democrat candidates. Through their duplicitous actions they could be assured they always had a seat at the table, but had plausible deniability that they were apolitical mercenaries just buying a seat at the table. My point, money is what most of these politicians actually care about.","And children have the same beliefs and motivations as their parents? What reason do we have to believe that Sophie executes her father's will or even agrees with his views on various issues? She has a career and life of her own, I'd wager.","You don't get to live under daddy's roof unless you're following his rules. If you rise into the same industry as your father, with your career-minded father guiding you along the way, you're not off scot-free when you've \"paid your dues.\" You can take the entire Trump lineage for a very notable and public example. Trump Sr. held Trump Jr. under his thumb, Trump Jr. holds Ivanka et al. under his thumb.","As long as the person that helped you get to where you are today is still in \"power,\" you're indebted until he loses his throne.","Their CFO, Ruth Porat, publicly wept at the weekly company meeting when Clinton lost. Google also heavily censored their otherwise automatic search autocomplete so it doesn’t bring up negative suggestions for HRC. No such courtesy was afforded to Trump. Bing, to their credit, did not censor either.","For autocomplete you can find plenty of evidence. For Google TGIF, that’s what I heard from googlers over some beers, so that claim will have to remain, as you put it, “loose”. It would be kind of strange if there was an official Google PR confirmation for something like that.","If Cambridge Analytica violated (a) the CFAA [1] or (b) federal election law [2][3], Palantir could be--best case--dragged into years of lawsuits. If they knew about said violations and did nothing, it could be more serious. Either way, I'd write off the near-term odds of their managing an IPO.","FEC: \"The Commission is made up of six members, who are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. Each member serves a six-year term, and two seats are subject to appointment every two years.[1] By law, no more than three Commissioners can be members of the same political party, and at least four votes are required for any official Commission action.\"\n- Wikipedia","Given the Republican's enthusiasm for pursuing Trump pecadillos, nothing will ever come from there.","It became pretty clear right after Trump won the election (as early as December 2016) during this meeting: https://youtu.be/oX_9yD2lN2g. Trump met with 13 tech company giants and somehow Alex Karp (CEO of Palantir) is at the table. The rest of the executives are from companies with market caps well into the hundreds of billions.","FWIW Palantir gave a pretty ironclad denial on the record for this article:","> A spokesperson for Palantir told CNBC the company has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica and has never worked on any Cambridge Analytica data. Cambridge Analytica was not immediately available for comment.","Yes, this. It seems SCL associates have exploited the commercial veil very effectively and we need to look behind that veil to work out what happened. I would also say that SCL has very cleverly exploited the difference between equity and contract payments to subvert spending caps. Invest a business...no spending cap.... I hate these guys. I'm a proud Brit, I do biz globally, and these guys have trashes Brand UK. I'm sometimes close to tears at what these guys have done.","The sad part isn't that CA mined the data or that Palantir helped build models, it's that those 50 million people believed in the campaigns they were fed. If a few powerful people can influence the masses to achieve their objectives, what good is democracy bringing to the table? More importantly, how different is mental manipulation compared to physical manipulation as commonly seen with dictatorship?","Back when propaganda was first being developed as a field, particularly between the two World Wars, it was greeted with a great deal of excitement by the powers that be precisely for this reason: It provided a non-physical means of coercing the will of the masses. There is plenty of material from those days about the wonders of propaganda, that it would enable the ruling elite to guide the caprices of the people while avoiding physical conflict (win/win!). It was always a half-baked idea, and the other shoe dropped very quickly (Nazi Germany was very forward thinking in its use of propaganda), but nothing changed.","I doubt that you can remove all social inequality, and it seems throughout history there have always been people who have exerted their wills more in order to accomplish their ends in society. The deep issue that we face is that there is no ingrained morality. Imagine if wealth and power were viewed as a weighty responsibility rather than a privilege--as the holder is responsible for using it to accomplish what they will, the choice of what one does reflects the quality and worth of the person. That's the reality in any case, but imagine if that were universally ingrained as how we, as a society, defined success....",">More importantly, how different is mental manipulation compared to physical manipulation as commonly seen with dictatorship?","A number of futurists from many decades ago foretold this transition of power from brute physical force to subtle information warfare:","\"World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation.

Nobody said democracies and open societies don't have serious problems.","Ha. I was just talking here the other day about how my friend at Facebook would always say that Palantir has even more data, including just about everything from Facebook, and a commenter responded that they couldn't see how Palantir would actually be able to scrape up Facebook's data...","I don't think tech companies are literally run by three-letter agencies, but after Yahoo and Lavabit (showing two very different reactions to surveillance requests), it's become pretty clear that any large US-based company is at minimum a backup or validation source for surveillance. The standing questions seem to be \"do they accept non-warrant surveillance?\" and \"do they allow bulk surveillance?\". If anyone still thinks they don't comply with targeted surveillance, I'd be shocked.","It's fantastic that they do collect and share this information - I imagine many thousands of arrests made based on data collected, if not 10K's+ I wouldn't be surprised if hundreds of lives were saved... and that's just the tip of the iceberg.","Subpoenas need some probable cause to be issued. It'd be interesting to estimate what percentage of target population you'd need to subpoena complete details on in order to build a social graph of the whole population, but I feel that that volume of legal activity would create waves even if it were only around 1%. Most court systems are overburdended as is, a significant increase would be noticeable.","Of course, if you were just getting that information as a matter of course in many arrests and were willing to accumulate it slowly over time it's very possible. I'm preoccupied with scraping issues as that's my only available avenue.","Could be a company in Texas named Harris Media was involved in the Kenyan election at the behest of CA according to the Channel 4 investigation.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","On Sunday morning, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment to the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. It has said previously that the company has made changes to privacy policies to prevent similar data loss without explicit consent from users.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential race — have intensified. He has authored blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as General Counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","The company also has worked hard in recent days to cast the data collection by people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica as not a “breach” because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

It’s possible that an investigation could lead to enforcement action and fines for Facebook. A representative for FTC told BuzzFeed News the agency had no additional comment on the investigation.","This isn’t the first time Facebook has been dinged by the FTC over user privacy. In 2011, Facebook and the FTC reached a settlement over charges that it deceived its users in a variety of ways, including: sharing posts that were marked “Friends Only” with third-party apps, storing data after users deleted their accounts, and sharing user data with advertisers after promising it wouldn’t. As part of the settlement, Facebook had to agree to several measures of transparency about user privacy, including \"giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings,\" preventing anyone from accessing data from deleted accounts, and getting a third-party privacy checkup every two years.","The user data taken by a researcher through a quiz app that was later sold to Cambridge Analytica happened in 2014, years after the FTC settlement. \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" according to a statement in Monday's FTC release.","Here is the full statement by Tom Pahl, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection:","The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers. Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.

Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F.T.C. confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0.4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week.","The F.T.C. said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users’ privacy.","The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings. Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day.","The agency’s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook’s stock down as much as 6.5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered. Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency.","The F.T.C. said in a statement on Monday that it “takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”","Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill. Last week, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify.","“I’m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, and I’m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there,” Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, said in an interview. “Facebook isn’t just a company. It is so powerful it is like a country.”","Some lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users.","“The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,” he said in a statement. “There is no excuse for delay.”","Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.","In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users, The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections, despite a warning from its own election lawyer.","The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.","The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had “strategic” or “operational” roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.","Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate “knowing and willful” violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.","“It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,” said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause’s vice president for policy and litigation.","In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company’s privacy and user data policies. One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Wiretap Act) and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform.","The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users’ browsing of third-party health sites.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

{"originalurl":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/cambridge-analytica-ceo-talks-to-techcrunch-about-trump-hilary-and-the-future/","title":"Cambridge Analytica CEO talks to TechCrunch about Trump, Hillary and the future – TechCrunch","text":["Cambridge Analytica CEO talks to TechCrunch about Trump, Hillary and the future","A few weeks ago I met with, and interviewed, Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica. His company has been credited with helping Donald Trump win the U.S. presidency. It’s also been associated with many other controversial political campaigns globally and accused by some of aiding the U.K.’s exit from the EU. He addresses all of these subjects in detail (a shorter summary is here).","The interview, which was recorded, was conducted in private at the IT Arena conference in Lviv, Ukraine.","This is the transcript of the interview, which was 50 minutes long:","Mike Butcher (MB):\nYou think that digital advertising agencies have ‘got it coming’, such as the WPPs of this world. What do you mean by that?","Alexander Nix (Nix):\nActually, probably not digital advertising agencies because they’re more progressive. I’m really looking at the old school traditional creative-led agencies. [For example] within WPP, obviously Martin (Sorrell) has made a huge effort to pivot his business. He’s making a huge effort every day, acquiring 40+ companies a year, something like that. But when you look at the traditional approach to advertising, which is fundamentally driven by guesswork, albeit very intuitive and experienced guesswork… The advert I was thinking about… do you remember the Cadbury’s advert of a gorilla playing the drums? I mean who could have known that that was going to be a national success? I mean, you’re telling me they went and opinion-surveyed 5,000 people and then decided to make a gorilla advert? Of course they didn’t! They just ‘wing’d it’ and it happened to push people’s buttons and it was a great success. Well, that sort of advertising is going to be replaced by highly targeted, very personalized advertising, and that has to be data-driven. That’s not replacing of creativity, that’s using data to augment creativity. Data first then creativity. It’s linear.","MB:\nLooking at the figures on your website you said you drove 1.5% increase in favourability among people who saw your [US election campaign] ads. Not everyone who becomes more favorable after seeing that ad is going to change their vote for instance. Most of them had been planning to vote for Trump already or [the ad] wouldn’t make enough difference to stop them voting for Hillary. But it might for influence a very small percentage of the electorate. That might have been enough to swing Michigan but not the whole election.","Nix:\nHow many states was the election won over? Four? I mean, winning Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida… That was pretty much it.","MB:\nBecause it came down the electoral college that you were targeting?","Nix:\nIt always comes down to that. It’s always the roadmap to 270. That changes every day. You go into the election: “We’re thinking okay these are 12-14 battleground states.” After six weeks you’re like: “Christ. That one’s dead. Got to move. How do how do we get there how do we do the sums to get back to where we want to be?” You know, you don’t need to and you can’t afford to focus on 50 states. You’re looking at… you know you’re going to win these ones you’re never going to win those, so how do you get to where you want to go?","MB:\nYou said the people who saw Cambridge Analytica adverts… the likelihood of voting for Trump increased by 1 percent. Isn’t it that one of the company’s claims?","Nix:\nGoogle’s study was based on the impact of our digital campaign. It said [there was an ] 11.3 percent increase in favourability for Trump. An 8.3 percent increase in intent to vote for Trump. These are significant numbers.","MB:\nSo in 2017 you can claim you have psychological profiles of 220m U.S. citizens based on five thousand separate data sets?","Nix:\nIt actually works slightly different to that. We went out and we started to roll out a long form quantitive survey to probe psychographics.","So we had hundreds of thousands of Americans fill out this survey. Completely independent from that we went and collected hundreds and then thousands of data points on every adult 230 million Americans.","MB:\nThis was publicly available data?","Nix:\nThis is publicly available data, this is client data, this is an aggregated third-party data. All sorts of data. In fact, we’re always acquiring more. Every day we have teams looking for new data sets.","Let’s say based on the personality survey that we’ve identified five personality types, only, for the whole of America. And let’s say for each personality type we’ve got a hundred thousand people of type A and Type B and Type C. Well, we’ll look at the hundred thousand type A personalities, and then we’ll have a look at the corresponding data points that we have on those hundred thousand people. We’ll have a look at what attributes they have in common and then we’ll build a model based on that. So if we identify that all type A personalities drive a lemon yellow car and wear Wellington boots and have a dog and three children and whatever, we can then make a prediction about everyone else in the universe who has a yellow car, a dog, Wellington boots and say well they’re very likely to also have a type A personality based on their data.","The best example I can give you [of] building a model [is that] in England we have a stereotype for conservatives, rural conservatives. They wear a barber [jacket], that Nigel Farage type. They wear a Barber and Wellington boots and have a Labrador, and they all went to private school, and they are therefore going to vote Tory. A stereotype but stereotypes are based on something. Well, that was four data points. Actually, it’s quite accurate in England. Imagine if you had 40 data points, or 400 and you extrapolated that they drive Land Rover, they like shooting, they both work in merchant banking and so on. You start to build up those data points and you can very accurately say “Well, I don’t know this person’s party political affiliation, but I do know they have a Barber and a Land Rover and a dog and they like shooting and work in merchant banking, therefore, they’re likely to be a Tory.","MB:\nSo you call this psychographics?","Nix:\nYes.","MB:\nBut did you use psychographics in the Trump campaign or didn’t you?","Nix:\nNo, we didn’t. We’ve been absolutely, incredibly clear about this. We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to roll out that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and roll out a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","MB:\nYou say you’ve been building this data since the late 90s. We know Facebook’s terms of service in 2006 were quite different to what they are now. And actually there was quite a lot of data — scrape is probably too blunt a word — but data which you could pull out of Facebook then that you can’t pull out now. Was it the case that you had huge data sets on these people before the door started to close on the [Facebook] terms of service?","Nix:\nWell, actually let me correct you. The company started in the early 90s or late 80s. We were a behavioural science company. We didn’t pivot into data analytics till 2012. So, all the data that we collected pre-2012, which was done by the British company SBL group, was collected through quantitive and qualitative research on the ground. Our modus operandi was to go and speak to, say, 100,000 people and start to use that to build on models.","MB:\nSpeak to them how? Via call centre surveys?","Nix:\nDepending on the country… I mean, in America, yes, call centres, the Internet where possible, face to face… But in a country like Nigeria you know you just have teams and teams of students going out there knocking on doors.","MB:\nSo you’re doing that in Nigeria?","Nix:\nWell, we’ve been doing that since our first election was 1994 for Mandela/ANC and since then we’ve done multiple elections every year.","MB:\nAnother claim CA makes is that you raised nearly $27m for Trump from 950,000 email addresses?","Nix:\nNo those are two separate things. We ran a ‘small-dollar’ fundraising program. So what we did was we used our data to identify core Trump supporters. These are the diehard Trump supporters of which we estimate there are about 37-38 million people in America. And we then targeted them with a with a donor solicitation or small dollars solicitation campaign to ask them to send donations in. And we built all the data and all the mechanisms to do that. We raised that $27m within the first month of starting work. In total, obviously, that program went on to raise hundreds and millions of dollars.","MB:\nWould you consider that to be being pivotal for their campaign?","Nix:\nWell, I think I think it was extremely pivotal because when Trump won the nomination he had very, very little money. And although he talked about putting a bit of money in himself, and he did put some money and some in as cash, most of it as loans, that’s my understanding, you know, you were competing against the machine and she had dollars coming out of everywhere.","Also, there was a huge “Never Trump” faction in America. Most of the Republicans didn’t support him, and even those who ended up working for him didn’t support him. So the RNC, the Republican National Committee, didn’t support him. Ultimately they pivoted. A lot of the key RNC members were part of the “Never Trump” faction. They were behind his back. They were trying to destroy him. And eventually they all they did a complete U-turn. Part of the reason why we were thrust into such a prominent role in this campaign is because none of the vendors would support him.","[Being among] Republican vender’s is an incredibly hostile environment. They were looking at this candidate and they said “Well, first and foremost we don’t like him.” A typical presidential campaign will probably have five or eight different companies support it. You’ll have a pollster, you’ll have a digital agency, you’ll have a TV agency, you’ll have a research firm. And then the campaign manager and the campaign committee will choose the best pollsters and the best thing or their best friend or however they figure these things out.","Well, Trump won the nomination and all the Republicans said “Well, he’s going to get murdered by Hillary. If we work for him, the establishment of the RNC is going to hate us. We’ll never get another dollar in U.S. politics again. So we’ll make a quick buck today, but it’s going to kill our career tomorrow.” So a lot of them are like “we’d never want to touch this.” So rather than having multiple vendors servicing his campaign, as is traditional, as Hillary had, we walked in there and said “We’ll do your data analytics.” And they were like: “There’s no one doing research.” [We said] we will do your research. “There’s no doing digital” We will do digital. “There’s no one doing TV.” “We’ll do your TV.” We’ll do your donations. And so overnight it went from being originally just data, to end to end.","MB:\nDid you believe you were betting the farm, as it were, on the campaign?","Nix:\nLook, from my perspective it was an easy bet to make. It was a win-win. I couldn’t see the downside. I thought even if Trump didn’t prevail if he didn’t win the election.","Look, we’re a British firm that was trying to break into the most competitive political market in the world. And you know, we had some mixed press. But what really irritates me is when journalists go to get a quote about our work. And someone says “We worked with Cambridge Analytica and their work didn’t really provide anything. It was rubbish.” And then you have a look at who the quote was from and it’s from a direct competitor!","And this is what the journalists haven’t quite figured out. A lot of the people that they speak to are people whose lunch we’re eating. We walked into [the US] market. We’re competing with all the data teams. We’re competing with all the digital teams, all the TV teams, all the research teams. You’ve seen House of Cards. It’s like that. It’s the most vicious aggressive political culture both at the candidate level, that Trump is now finding out. At the campaign manager, GC level and at the vendor level. It’s a bloodbath. The knives… [are out]. In DC, everyone’s fucking everyone else.","You see three quotes they’re all from people whose business you’ve stolen. They’re saying things like we came across “Cambridge Analytica. It’s All snake oil” [and it’s from] our biggest rival.","MB:\nDo you think there’s a mischaracterization of the tools used by targeted advertising campaigns, or so-called ‘custom audience’ campaigns, as being described as “dark advertising” campaigns?","Nix:\nThere’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world. And there are some things that I would definitely [say] I’m very proud of that we’re doing which are innovative. And there are some things which is best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.","Advertising agencies are using some of these techniques on a national scale. For us it’s been very refreshing, really breaking into the commercial and brand space… walking into a campaign where you’re basically trying to educate the market on stuff they simply don’t understand. You walk into a sophisticated brand or into an advertising agency, and the conversation [is sophisticated] You go straight down to: “Ah, so you’re doing a programmatic campaign, you can augment that with some linear optimized data… they understand it.” They know it’s their world, and now it comes down to the nuances. “So what exactly are you doing that’s going to be a bit more effective and give us an extra 3 percent or 4 percent there.” It’s a delight. You know these are professionals who really get this world and that’s where we want to be operating.","MB:\nDo you regret the way your own business is being presented in the media?","Nix:\nIf there’s any testament to what’s driving the media just have a glance at Hillary Clinton’s recent book. The liberal press are supporting their candidate. They got fairly beaten and they’re lashing out and trying to destroy every single person and every company that contributed to that defeat. Hillary simply cannot come to terms with it. She’s a woman in denial. The liberal press [characterized Cambridge Analytica] as “witchcraft, they treat it is “voodoo” and now it’s Russia’s fault! They just cannot accept the fact that Hillary was such an unpopular, such a divisive candidate. She failed to mobilize her base and people didn’t fundamentally trust her. Rather than looking in the mirror, they much prefer to beat up Cambridge [Analytica] beat up Trump, beat up anyone else. Anything but accept the fact that their candidate wasn’t what the people wanted to vote for.","MB:\nWould you use your own methods to improve your own public image?A marketing campaign for yourself to create a better image for your own company?","Nix:\nWould we rollout a national behavioral micro-targeting program to promote Cambridge Analytica? It probably wouldn’t really achieve what we’re trying to do. I mean actually, I’m just ‘dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s’ on a book which talks about our methodology and our approach to communications and I was speaking to the publisher about whether we should target that. It’s a book hasn’t been published yet, it’ll come out next month, just talking really in quite technical terms about how communication is changing, what how technology is impacting that, what data is doing to advertising and political campaigns and then using a lot of case studies with a lot of real examples of artwork and targeting and psychographics and so forth to illustrate them. We were toying with the idea of [a campaign]. But I think it’s too complex to try and use our techniques to promote a book. It was more of a thought exercise right. It would mean having multiple versions multiple titles multiple dust sheets.","MB:\nA/B testing for a book? Is the book coming out in the New Year?","Nix:\nIt’s coming out in Germany first because it was a German publisher that approached us. It will be coming out in about the next month or so and then later in the U.K.","MB:\nIt is going to be about the company or methodology. Or your worldview?","Nix:\nThe English title is not confirmed yet but I think it will be something like “Mad men to maths men”. It’s going to be [about] the evolution of the advertising industry, how data, how psychology, how digital is changing an industry that really hasn’t changed very much. And what that disruption means in terms of an industry of you know multi-billion dollar industry and illustrating different campaigns that we’ve done to show the effectiveness of that.","MB:\nOn Brexit there were headlines such as ‘The great Brexit robbery, our democracy was hijacked’. How do you react to those?","Nix:\nWell, look, I mean you’re implying therefore that we were involved in Brexit and part of that “robbery”. We’ve been, again, crystal clear to all media including The Guardian, who really propagated this story from day one, based on nothing. Carole Cadwalladr has made it her personal mission to come after us again, living in denial about the outcome of the election. She cannot accept that the British people wanted to leave Europe and she’s made it her mission to vilify us. We did not work on Brexit. We didn’t do a little bit of work. We didn’t do a lot of work. We did no work on Brexit. We were not involved in the campaign for either Leave.eu or Vote Leave, at all. And we have been crystal clear on this which is why we’re going to be taking them to court and we’re going to settle.","MB:\nWhy do you think you became associated with it then?","Nix:\nWell because before the campaigns were launched we were approached by a number of different campaigns, pro and against, to discuss whether there might be a role for us on Brexit. And we had a number of discussions. Obviously, these discussions made their way into the public forum but we meet with hundreds of companies every year and talk about business opportunities. That doesn’t mean you engage with them doesn’t mean you contract with them and it certainly doesn’t mean that you work for them. But The Guardian came out with one or two data points and then created an entire narrative around that that was pure fiction. That went viral and then every other newspaper [piled into it]. If you tell a lie often enough it becomes truth. But even after we came out and denied that again and again and again they just kept propagating the same message.","MB:\nBut you are working in other campaigns. There’s been some controversy about Kenya and South Africa for instance. How do you react to those?","Nix:\nWell, you are talking about Bell Pottinger, [which has] paid the consequences for some bad decisions.","MB:\nDid you work on those campaigns?","Nix:\nNo, we weren’t involved with the actors. We weren’t involved with Bell Pottinger, we weren’t involved with the Guptas. In fact, I know very little about that. And I really can’t make a commentary on what happened. I know only what I’ve read in the paper.","MB:\nYou worked on the Kenya campaign?","Nix:\nWe’ve worked all across Africa.","MB:\nKenya?","Nix:\nWell, let’s wait till the election’s over because we never talk about elections that live, generally, as a rule of thumb. But I can tell you that we worked in Kenya in 2013 on the last election for Kenyatta. That’s well documented. I can speak to that. Look, Kenyatta won by 12 points and there were some few irregularities, from what I’ve read, in the way that the election oversight committee… [granted] some of the tenders [for] election equipment. The opposition used these irregularities to challenge the outcome of the election. I think had this been a “Florida” years ago when it came down to half a percent, ok. But when you’re talking about a 12 percent victory I think that the court’s decision to hold this [new] election was a dreadful decision. I think that it is going to result in dreadful bloodshed, horrific violence. If Kenyatta for any reason doesn’t win this election then his supporters are going to feel robbed. And if Odinga’s people don’t, they’re going to feel that he’s cheated again because that’s the perception that Odinga is put out into the public domain.","I can’t see this ending well. I think just for the sake of Kenya, for peace in the region, I think it’s a dreadful decision. I actually can’t even see this election being resolved in the next month. I think it’s going to drag on. So, I think the court’s decision was shortsighted.","MB:\nWhat’s your answer to critics who claimed that you’ve worked on behalf of the Russian government or third party actors connect to them? Either for specifically in relation to Trump’s campaign or to other campaigns.","Nix:\nWe’ve never been asked directly. No one of authority has leveled any direct criticisms to us and, certainly, no one has suggested that we’d been or alleged that we’d been involved as far as I’m aware. We’re not under investigation by anyone. We are helping wherever we can with the understandings of the campaign, like everyone else in the campaign, but there’s no investigation into Cambridge [Analytica].","MB:\nIsn’t the U.S. Congress investigating you in connection with Russian attempts to interfere with the election?","Nix:\nNo, it’s not. The US Congress is undertaking…","MB:\nThe Atlantic magazine reported it.","Nix:\n[Scoffs] Oh then it must be true! I don’t know… I mean that’s exactly what I’m talking about. My understanding is that the U.S. Congress is undertaking an investigation into Russian interference into the election and they’ve asked all sorts of people for help into that. That’s not suggesting in any way, any way at all, that Cambridge is under investigation. And you know we’re more than happy to help. We never worked in Russia. We never worked for Russia. I want to be careful, but I don’t think we have any Russian employees in our company whatsoever. We just don’t have business in Russia. We have no involvement with Russia, never have done.","MB:\nWhat about for third parties associated with Putin’s government?","Nix:\nI wouldn’t even know who they were and where to begin. I mean, we worked directly for the campaign, as indirectly, and we worked for a Super Pac in support of the campaign [called] “defeat crooked Hillary” was it’s unofficial title or “keep the promise” or something.","MB:\nYou have an investor, Robert Mercer. What sort of independence does that give you? He has known political views. Do you feel independent of an investor like that?","Nix:\nWell, actually, I’m not going to speak about any of our investors or board members at all because we don’t. But I can answer your question which is ‘is our political ideology influenced by other people in the company’ at whatever level? And the answer to that [is this]… We undertake 7 to 9 elections a year, somewhere in the world, for Prime Minister or President. And for as many of those are on the Left of Centre or the Right of Centre. In fact, if you were to total them up, I would probably say – and this is based on a guesstimate – that we’d done more Left-leaning than Right-leaning. Now, clearly in America…","MB:\nCan you give me any examples of those Left-leaning campaigns?","Nix:\nYou’d have to go on our website. I’m sure you could find 25, and you can just see which parties. It’ll all be there. But in America you have to pick a side. You can’t flip-flop. You are not encouraged work for the Democrats in one cycle and then move to the Republicans [on the next]. And the reason the Republicans were attractive to us was because the Democrats were significantly leading the tech arms race. Under Obama through Civas and Blue Labs they had pioneered the use of big data. They were using very sophisticated digital technologies. And the Republicans had been left behind. By the time Romney lost in 2012 there was a vacuum. There just wasn’t the tech talent on the Right to be able to compete. It was like taking a knife to a gunfight. And so that was the commercial opportunity. Now, the reason for that is because most of the tech community, and I’m going to generalize here, but a lot of the tech community that were politically oriented tended to lean Left. People in Berkeley and MIT, and so forth, would, if they were politically motivated, support Hillary or Obama. Whereas, people who might be more Right of centre, obviously, would look typically to go and work in banking or investment management with those skills. And so because of the dearth of talent the Republicans were getting murdered in the tech arms race. That was the commercial opportunity, that was the one we sought to address. Right? Had it been the other way around it might have been a different story.","MB:\nWhat are your own personal political views? Do you talk about those?Nix:\nWe leave our personal ideologies at the door. We think that being “foreign” and objective is an asset in elections. I think that a lot of political campaigns, and in the U.S., a lot of campaign staff and vendors get blinded by their own ideology. They blindly believe in their candidate to an extent that they actually can’t see objectively what’s happening in the campaign. They can only see what they and all their friends believe and therefore they assume that’s representative of 200 million voters take","MB:\n[You’re saying] They project themselves onto campaigns?","Nix:\nYeah naturally. And there’s something wonderful about coming into a foreign country as an outsider and looking with completely fresh eyes at a political landscape and be able to not have a clouded judgment. And that’s what we bring. And equally, it’s like a good lawyer representing his or her client. You can’t go in there with a preconception of guilty or not. You have to go in there and look at the facts. And that’s what we try to do.","MB:\nDo you have a blacklist of anyone you wouldn’t work for?","Nix:\nOh yes for sure. We only work for mainstream political parties. Tories, Labour, Republicans, Democrats. We steer clear of fringe political parties or minority groups. We’re not trying to orchestrate a revolution. We’re trying to provide the best tech… communication technology to political parties. As I said before, elections are about 20 percent of our revenue as a company. We’ve got about 20/25 percent in defence and homeland security. The rest is in the brand and commercial space. We are not a political company. We’re a tech company, and we see ourselves as tech company. We have a tech culture, where we attract academics. You know a third of our staff are PhDs. We’re geeks! Fundamentally, we’re a bunch of geeky people who are trying to solve problems and I would say that politics is probably the least desirable division in the company, because it can be divisive and people don’t necessarily like to get involved. But, if you give a data scientist a really challenging problem like identifying the ideology of a nation or an issue, a model or something, it’s about solving the problem. It is not about trying to promote their own personal ideology or agenda or anything like that.","MB:\nYou’re working with Palantir?","Nix:\nNo. Palantir was established about nine or 10 years ago now. They’re very active of course in the defence, homeland security. They were a pioneer and a leader in this field. Peter Thiel, in applying both his platforms, Gotham and Metropolis, and other work which is slightly more off the radar, it is truly revolutionary. I mean these guys were genuine first movers. And I think that companies like us have caught up. But kudos to them. They were really very early on to the scene.","MB:\nI think you count the Pentagon as a client don’t you?","Nix:\nWe formed a defence/government defence division in 2005. Over that period we’ve worked for global militaries all over the world. We train a lot of armies in something called PSYOP, which is psychological operations or information operations, which is, sort of communication warfare. It’s trying to understand how to persuade troops not to fight or to persuade your troops to fight. It’s trying to combat hostile behavior or how do you counter radicalization or counter-terrorism, and so forth. We do a lot of information operation programs ourselves [where] we go into countries and conduct the research and the campaigns to change behavior to reduce conflict. And our clients do include, in the U.K, the MOD and the FCO, and in the United States, all the ‘coms’, so NorthCom, Safcom, State Department, Pentagon and various ‘three letter agencies’ and so forth.","MB:\nWhat’s your what’s your vision for the future? You’ve talked about psychographic profiling, analytics about the amount of data sets there are, and the data you can pull out social media. And of course, we all know that Alexa’s in their houses recording what they are saying. Where do you see things heading? Firstly, which direction do you feel your own company is going in, given the amount of data out there? Secondly, do you think you might end up butting up against the Google and Amazons in data collection?","Nix:\nThere are several questions there. Let’s start with the bigger picture. There are two technologies that I’m really excited by and that everyone is talking about. Clearly, IOT is going to totally radicalize the data market. I think the data business is doomed, myself. It’s a very, very high volume and very low margin [business]. As the internet of things grows, as we have sensors on everything: cars, fridges, TVs then data is going to become ubiquitous. Therefore the volume of data will increase, the price of data is going to go down. You won’t be able to sell data in the way you can today. I think people are going to start taking control of their data much more. There is going to be more reciprocity in the way that people share their data with companies like my own and other marketing agencies. But generally, the increase in data is one factor that is going to make analytics companies like ours more valuable. More data is going to need more analytics, period. And then at the other end — if you see it as a sandwich and we’re in the middle — you’ve got blockchain. And by having distributed ledger technology you’re going to an ability to have transparency, and to have accountability as to how data is and data sets are being used and implemented, forevermore, in perpetuity. And so, yes the data landscape is getting more frightening with IOT. But on the other hand, it’s going to be to be more self-regulated through the Blockchain and it’s going to be more transparent. And both of those things are the bread rolls with the analytics being the chess in the middle of the sandwich. Analytics are going to play more and more of a function in deciphering huge quantities of data, making sense of it, applying it into many different areas and then using blockchain technologies to securitize that.","In terms of the advertising industry: Look, I’ve been very vocal about this but I don’t think that, again, I’m sort of some sort of ‘soothsayer’. I think a lot of people in the industry recognize this… And even if they are only whispering to each other… I think the advertising industry is like lemmings on the edge of a cliff. They can’t go backwards and forwards looks terrifying. Omnicom, Dentsu, WPP… they’re trying to pivot. They’re acquiring companies left right and centre. But you can’t just buy a data company and squash it together with an ad agency and hope it’s just going to work. It doesn’t work like that, that it’s a different culture. It takes integration. You need to grow these things together. You’ve got all the consultancies which saw a commercial opportunity in the last two or three years and started acquiring data companies. They’re trying to acquire advertising agencies in order to get into this space. Then nipping at the heels of the big conglomerates and taking considerable market share from them. You’ve got the big brands themselves understanding their data is so valuable they no longer want to give that away to advertising agencies. They can bring some of these capabilities in-house and have their own data analytics and marketing agencies in-house. That’s damaging them.","Then you’ve got the small disruptors like us who are only going to become more numerous. We’re eating a piece of the pie. So, I think there is going to be a reckoning, and it’s happening now. WPP’s market share has taken a nosedive in the last month or three. But they’re not going to be the only ones. It’s going to continue. I’m not suggesting that they’re all going to go bust, but I am saying it’s “adapt or die”. This market is fundamentally shifting and about time too! This is overdue. Gone are the days where an advertiser does an advert. And as long as the client’s wife likes it there are no metrics other than audience recall to quantify its success. Or very few. And they don’t care anymore. They can just squeeze a lemon and get some money out of advertisers. I think that advertisers want more accountability, they want more measurement of effectiveness, they want empirical data to be able to justify these enormous multi-billion dollar spends.","MB:\nLet’s fast forward say,10-20 years. There will be people who can afford to buy privacy and then there will be plenty of people who will give away their data in return for services, as they do now. Do we do we think that that’s a good situation to be in? What’s your view?","Nix:\nI think gone are the days where people just click a box without really thinking it through, and all their data has just been siphoned away and gone. Grabbed. I think people are recognizing that data is valuable AND that they’re [also] saying, “Well actually it’s not that sensitive. I don’t really care much if people understand my shopping habits or what car I drive. This isn’t health or financial data. But it is valuable and why should I just give it away so that other firms and advertisers can make money out of it?” So I see more of a reciprocity. I see people having something like a virtual data wallet. They’re going to have control of their data. You’ll be able to say to them “Hey can I licence your data or use your data for a certain campaign or purpose?” And there’s going to be an exchange there. They’re going to say “Yes you can but it’s going to cost you 10 percent off that” or “I want this in return.” And I see that market emerging as people take control. I think that’s really sensible. I think it gives people more control and therefore it gives them more protection. I think advertisers will need to be a little more targeted in the way that they use data and they gather data, which is probably good. But actually, it’s not going to dent the industry or the direction that it’s growing in. So I really hope that people like the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK which rules on data privacy for individuals], who are suddenly trying to catch up on the last five years of data. I hope that they understand that the regulation needs to be there to protect consumers, but not to stump the growth of an industry that could really do a lot of good. Not just in communications, [but] across all corporate sectors.","MB:\nIf consumers had more control over their data wouldn’t that start to slightly stump the work that you do?","Nix:\nNo, I don’t think it will because I think things are changing. I think that the older generation, our parents or even older… you know, this is a terrifying brave new world for them. “What do you mean someone knows what car I drive?!” “Yes, mother they do know what car you drive” “But that’s awful!” “Why is it awful?” “Well because I didn’t want them to know that!” “Do you care?” “That’s not the point.” “Well, it is the point!” Actually, the new generation, the next generation, younger than us, they don’t care. They actually just don’t care.","MB:\nThey are used to this world?","Nix:\nThey are used to this world and they realize it. “Do I care if people know what car I drive, what cereal I eat for breakfast?” And why should they, really? They don’t care if they put a picture of themselves blind drunk on Facebook doing something. They don’t care. Let alone [someone knowing] what car they drive.","MB:\nDo they care if they feel that it might influence an election?","Nix:\nWell, that’s a good question. Ultimately, I don’t think people are naive, now, especially not the Internet generation, the Millennials. I think they do understand what’s going on. There’s been so much press. It’s not about hoodwinking people. Remember, it’s the same for all sides. It’s not like Trump had some secret sauce that he was employing with Cambridge that the Democrats didn’t. Hillary’s data and digital teams were up to 200 people or something! Huge! Huge! This was tried and tested. It was a machine! They were doing everything! But the reason they’re not in the spotlight is twofold. A: Hillary lost. And B: Trump’s, you know, is somewhat perceived by many as more of a polarizing character. That’s why. It’s not what we did. I mean, I think if we’d done exactly the same work, no different, but done it for Hillary…","MB:\nYou think the result would have been the same?","Nix:\nNo, I think no one would care. The Guardian wouldn’t be writing these stupid headlines and nor would The New York Times. They wouldn’t care. This is not about Cambridge. It’s not about our tech. It’s about Trump."],"isopubdate":"2017-11-06"}

Credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg","Government officials in the U.S. and Europe are demanding answers from Facebook after reports that Cambridge Analytica, the advertising-data firm that helped Donald Trump win the U.S. presidency, retained information on tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent.","Over the weekend, entreaties for the social-media giant to take responsibility evolved into calls for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear in front of lawmakers. Facebook has already testified about how its platform was used by Russian propagandists ahead of the 2016 election, but the company never put Zuckerberg himself in the spotlight with government leaders. The pressure may also foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network.","The company on Friday said that a professor used Facebook's log-in tools to get people to sign up for what he claimed was a personality-analysis app he had designed for academic purposes. To take the quiz, 270,000 people gave the app permission to access data via Facebook on themselves and their friends, exposing a network of 50 million people, according to the New York Times. That kind of access was allowed per Facebook's rules at the time. Afterward, the professor violated Facebook's terms when he passed along that data to Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook found out about the breach in 2015, shut down the professor's access and asked Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted the user data. Yet the social network on Friday suspended Cambridge from its system, explaining that it had learned the information wasn't erased. Cambridge, originally funded by conservative political donor Robert Mercer, on Saturday denied that it still had access to the user data, and said it was working with Facebook on a solution.","A researcher who worked with the professor on the app is now currently an employee at Facebook, which is reviewing whether he knew about the data leak.","The denials and refutations did little to ease the criticism. Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Sunday that Zuckerberg or another senior executive should appear in front of his committee because previous witnesses have avoided difficult questions, creating \"a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.'' He added in an interview on British radio Monday that Zuckerberg should \"stop hiding behind his Facebook page and actually come out and answer questions about his company.\"","The next few weeks represent a critical time for Facebook to reassure users and regulators about its content standards and platform security, to prevent rules that could impact its main advertising business, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.","\"Changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,\" Ives wrote in a note to investors.","Not a 'breach'","Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to explain that the mishandling of user data was out of its hands and doesn't constitute a \"breach\"—a definition that would require the company to alert users about whether their information was taken, per U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules.","Menlo Park, California-based Facebook no longer allows app developers to ask for access to data on users' friends. But the improper handling of the data raises systemic questions about how much companies can be trusted to protect personal information, said Nuala O'Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology.","\"While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways,\" O'Connor said in a statement. \"Communications technologies have become an essential part of our daily lives, but if we are unable to have control of our data, these technologies control us. For our democracy to thrive, this cannot continue.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He had been a strong advocate for an aggressive approach to alleged Russian activity on the platform aimed at manipulating elections. His departure was first reported by the New York Times. Facebook declined immediate comment.","In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change.”","Related Coverage","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","London-based Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","However, further allegations about the firm’s tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery.","Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report “is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”","Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the U.S. Congress after the reports in the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend.","Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.","Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.","Late on Monday, the Connecticut Attorney General said the office will initiate an inquiry into Facebook data policies.","The Senate was expected to move forward on Monday with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app. The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users — and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so-called psychometric profiles of American voters, setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain.","Image","Mr. Thiel at Trump Tower in Manhattan. He serves on the board at Facebook.CreditEduardo Munoz/Reuters","The revelations pulled Palantir — co-founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel — into the furor surrounding Cambridge, which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016. Mr. Thiel, a supporter of President Trump, serves on the board at Facebook.","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a data expert and Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.","Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm’s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian.","Image","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.CreditParliamentary Recording Unit, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images","The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr. Wylie’s testimony on Tuesday. Both companies are linked to tech-driven billionaires who backed Mr. Trump’s campaign: Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer, the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate, while Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by Mr. Thiel, who was an initial investor in Facebook.","The Palantir employee, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, works on business development for the company, according to his LinkedIn page. In an initial statement, Palantir said it had “never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica, nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.” Later on Tuesday, Palantir revised its account, saying that Mr. Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company’s behalf when he advised Mr. Wylie on the Facebook data.","“We learned today that an employee, in 2013-2014, engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica,” the company said. “We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action.”","The company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort. Mr. Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role.","Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013, Mr. Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr. Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account. At the time, Mr. Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group, which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr. Mercer the next year. The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles, a product code-named “Big Daddy.”","A former intern at SCL — Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Eric Schmidt, then Google’s executive chairman — urged the company to link up with Palantir, according to Mr. Wylie’s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times.","“Ever come across Palantir. Amusingly Eric Schmidt’s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them?” one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email.","Ms. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica.","In early 2013, Alexander Nix, an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns.","A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership, in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work. Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Nix and Mr. Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014, but Palantir executives again declined.","In his testimony, Mr. Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship. But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge’s psychographic models.","“There were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Mr. Wylie told lawmakers. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.” He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them.","Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge’s backing from Mr. Mercer, one of the world’s richest men, according to messages viewed by The Times. And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir’s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business.","In an interview this month with The Times, Mr. Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics. Those discussions continued through spring 2014, according to Mr. Wylie.","Mr. Wylie said that he and Mr. Nix visited Palantir’s London office on Soho Square. One side was set up like a high-security office, Mr. Wylie said, with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes. The other side, he said, was like a tech start-up — “weird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer, and there’s a Ping-Pong table.”","Mr. Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr. Wylie’s team in 2014, as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski, to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr. Kosinski had built. The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge’s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients.","“I had left field idea,” Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014. “What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook?” Reproducing the app, Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote, “could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy.”","Those negotiations failed. But Mr. Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher, the Russian-American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook. Over subsequent months, Dr. Kogan’s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters.","Carole Cadwalladr contributed reporting.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Spy Contractor’s Idea Helped A Firm Harvest Facebook Data.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

They've just really got to do better,\" she said.","\"What we desperately need is for Facebook to finally open up and be as honest and transparent as it can be about the way that their platform was used and manipulated during the U.S. presidential elections, during Brexit in the U.K.,\" Cadwalladr said, adding that Facebook continually tried to prevent her story from being published.","In a statement released late on Friday, Facebook acknowledged that it learned it had been \"lied to\" about Cambridge Analytica and an affiliate's activities in 2015, more than two years before suspending the firm from its platform, but did not alert users at the time. Facebook insisted there was no breach of their system.","After speaking with the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office, which promotes the protection of private information, Cadwalladr said it is clear \"this is a data breach.\"","\"Facebook has just turned around and blamed a third party,\" Cadwalladr said. \"We are clear this is a data breach, and Facebook's denials in the face of it -- their claim that it's not a data breach because nobody hacked into their system -- well, failing to secure your own data, failing to see how it's being used ... that falls within the definition of a data breach. Accept it, Facebook. Own it.\"","\"In a way it's even more damning that [Cambridge Analytica] got all of this data from Facebook without it being a breach,\" Wired editor-in-chief and CBS News contributor Nick Thompson said on CBSN.","\"It didn't work because somebody hacked in and broke stuff,\" Thompson added. \"It worked because Facebook has built the craziest most invasive advertising model in the history of the world and someone took advantage of it.\"","Since it was a violation of Facebook's terms of services, Thompson said he's not sure what government agency would be tasked with regulating the platform to prevent a recurrence in the political sphere.","\"I'm not sure, though, that you can actually regulate your way out of this problem because on the flip side of this, the reason political advertising on Facebook is so effective is because Facebook is a great tool for advertising,\" he said. \"You can't just shut down all advertising on Facebook or make it harder for people to micro-target on Facebook because in general that's just the way business works and they invented this great tool.\"","Cadwalladr said Facebook would have needed to inform 58 million people that their personal information was taken and \"essentially, there's no way of getting it back.\"","\"Once it's taken, it's out in the world, it can be copied, it can be stored elsewhere -- we just don't know what's happened to that data,\" Cadwalladr said Saturday. She said she was appalled that Facebook did \"almost nothing\" to delete or secure the data that was harvested."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

These data-driven technologies rely upon huge volumes and varieties of data that are gathered ubiquitously from multiple sources and processed at high velocity. In the smart cities environment, for example, data is gathered from sensors installed and operated by governments (for example, to measure traffic flows, air quality or the consumption of services), as well as by private sector companies under contract with the government. In some cases, data is generated entirely by the operations of private sector actors (for example, traffic data collected by Waze or Uber). Citizens may be voluntary or involuntary sensors: they generate data through the consumption of services, as well as through their use of popular apps for fitness, route planning, driving or navigation, to give just a few examples. Individuals may also gather and contribute data to urban citizen science or public participatory projects. Outside of the smart cities context, data collection tracks almost every aspect of our digital lives, including web-surfing activities, interactions on social media, shopping habits, viewing preferences and so much more. The Internet of Things (IoT) is an “always-on” networked environment in which data is harvested about our activities, thoughts, wants and needs, seamlessly across public and formerly private spaces (such as the home). An insatiable corporate and government appetite for data combined with ubiquitous and unbounded collection drives innovation, yet also creates the potential for risk and harm, ranging from security breaches to discrimination, persecution, and loss of autonomy and dignity.","Citizens may be voluntary or involuntary sensors: they generate data through the consumption of services, as well as through their use of popular apps for fitness, route planning, driving or navigation, to give just a few examples.","The sheer volume of data at issue, its economic importance and societal impacts, reveal the need for a national data strategy. Such a strategy is made all the more imperative by the lack of a cohesive or even a contemporary approach to data in Canadian law. The current regime has yet to fully adapt to data as a resource. And laws designed to protect individuals from exploitation are framed around what were once distinct and siloed issues. For example, we have separate agencies to address what are characterized as human rights, consumer protection, privacy or credit reporting issues, arising in either the public or the private sector. Today, the blurring of public and private — in particular around data — as well as the deeply interwoven challenges raised by big data, AI and machine learning, make it problematic to silo issues in this way. Fragmented approaches complicate and slow responses to problems that are emerging and evolving in real time.","A national data strategy must address the core issues, outlined below, while taking into account the challenges of federalism and international trade. These complexities are not new. For example, in 2001, Canada introduced the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).1 The statute was made necessary by strong data protection measures enacted by the European Union, but it tiptoed around federal/provincial jurisdiction over data protection, giving rise to a complicated patchwork of application. While intermittent rumblings about the constitutionality of PIPEDA have largely abated, and while the law’s constitutionality might be easier to support in our current data context, the statute serves as a reminder of how international trade concerns can drive domestic policy and how the division of powers can prove challenging in addressing issues that arise from cross-border data flows. For a national data strategy to succeed, there is a need for consensus and cooperation at the federal-provincial level.","Ownership of Data","Who owns the data that fuels our data-driven society and what are the limits of any ownership rights? These issues are arising more frequently in case law and in policy discussions, and are complicated by the fact that so much of the data that is used in big data and machine learning has its origins as personal data.","The scope of ownership rights in data is uncertain, although this does not stop companies and governments from asserting them. In Canada, IP law recognizes rights in data in two main contexts — where data is confidential information and protectable as such, and where data is part of a compilation that is eligible for copyright protection.","The laws of confidential information support and protect corporate investments that have led to the generation of data. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, these judge-made laws increasingly butt up against the public interest in disclosure of some information. The importance of data in understanding increasingly complex issues with deep societal effects has led to the recognition of broader rights of access to confidential information in the public interest in some limited circumstances2 and to calls for the recognition of such rights in a growing range of contexts.3","Much of the data that is used in big data and machine learning has its origins as personal data. (Photo: Settawat Udom / Shutterstock.com)","Facts on their own cannot be protected under copyright law, although some case law has begun to sketch out what might ultimately be a legal distinction between facts and data.4 Whether this is an appropriate distinction may be a matter for public policy: the rationale for facts remaining in the public domain is to keep innovation from being stifled by private ownership of the building blocks of knowledge. Copyright law will protect compilations of fact — in theory, this includes databases, so long as they meet the threshold for originality, which requires that a compilation be the result of an “original selection or arrangement” of facts.5 Concerns that this provided too uncertain a level of protection for databases led to the European Union creating a sui generis database right in 1996.6 More recently, there has been talk in Europe about the need to create a data ownership right (European Commission 2017). This embryonic concept presents many challenges, but the fact that it is being discussed indicates that this is an area that may require policy attention. Any new ownership right would have to be carefully delineated, in particular so as not to unduly stifle innovation, or to impede rights to access and use of data in the public interest.","Any “ownership” rights in the form of IP interests must be accompanied by rights of access to serve a multi-faceted public interest. In copyright law, users have fair dealing rights. Debates and discussion about fair dealing are increasingly part of international trade negotiations. How any changes to copyright law — including term extension, technological protection measures and rights of fair dealing/fair use — will impact upon copyright claims relating to data and compilations of data must receive serious scrutiny. Given the centrality and economic significance of data in our economy, these impacts should not be accidental or unintended.","The nature and importance of rights of access in our data economy can be seen in recent skirmishes over the practice of scraping publicly accessible data from web platforms.7 Litigation in such cases includes — but goes beyond — copyright issues. For example, courts are being asked to rule on whether the automated scraping of data violates property, IP or contractual rights, whether it is criminal in nature, or whether it is an acceptable exercise of users’ rights. These complex cases raise important issues about rights of access to data, rights to own/control data and the public interest in relation to publicly accessible data. And, while the litigation tends to involve commercial actors, data scrapers include journalists, civil society groups and even governments. While ownership rights are important, access is also critical.","Personal information fuels a growing number of algorithms that impact lives in foreseeable and as yet unforeseeable ways.","Ownership rights provided by law are largely instrumental. They can shape relationships between parties with respect to specific resources. How ownership rights should be exercised or addressed by governments is a separate but no less important issue. Governments are creators, custodians and users of data and governments have important choices to make in this regard.","The role of governments in relation to data is already evident in the open data movement in which Canadian governments at all levels are becoming invested. A wealth of government data is now shared under open licences through data portals designed to facilitate access and reuse. An important objective of open data strategies is to stimulate innovation by providing useful data resources in a reusable format and unburdened by legal restrictions. How well such movements achieve these goals remains an open question (Johnson et al. 2017). Yet the open data movement recognizes government’s role as a data source and deserves attention within a national data strategy.","Open data is but one manifestation of government data strategies. The federal government is now extending the open data concept to government-funded research through its open science initiative. Governments can also use their regulatory jurisdiction to make other data public,8 and it is important to consider when it might be strategically important to do so. There is room for government to play a role in developing unique and valuable data resources that could drive innovation. At the same time, there are also risks that governments will make nearsighted choices around data ownership, in particular in the context of public-private relationships. How data resources are managed in the rapidly evolving smart cities context will be an important measure of governments’ ability to think strategically about data and to develop data policy that serves the public interest (see, for example, Scassa 2017).","Data Protection and Privacy Considerations","Another plank in a national data strategy is data protection. Although PIPEDA applies to the private sector collection, use and disclosure of personal information, it is poorly adapted to a context in which data is a key economic asset. Although there is reason enough to do so independently, Canada may (once again) be forced to revisit private sector data protection following developments in the European Union. The newly passed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)9 sets a much higher threshold for data protection than currently exists in Canada. Because data flows so freely from one jurisdiction to another, the European Union has made the availability of comparable data protection legislation in states to which personal data is transferred for processing a prerequisite for such transfers.","There are reasons besides international trade for Canada to step up its level of private sector data protection. Personal information fuels a growing number of algorithms that impact lives in foreseeable and as yet unforeseeable ways. Data breaches are becoming more and more devastating and costly. The IoT is expanding the reach of data collection into some of our most private and personal realms. Robust data protection is rapidly becoming a precondition for maintaining basic human dignity and autonomy, as well as transparency and social justice.","Aspects of the GDPR also reflect the growing interrelationships between personal data protection and other once-siloed areas of law and regulation. The new data portability right, for example, is tied to consumer protection and consumer choice, as well as to competition law concerns. PIPEDA is barely adequate to address privacy considerations — and it is not adequate to address the much more complex personal data ecosystem that is emerging.","Just as the boundaries between the private sector and the public sector are becoming more difficult to navigate in contexts such as smart cities, the boundaries between the public sector and the private sector have become increasingly blurred. Governments contract with private sector companies for data and algorithms, and private sector companies seek access to valuable data collected by governments. At the same time, law enforcement and national security agencies are pressuring governments for new ways to tap into the vast stores of personal information collected by private sector companies. A national data strategy must take into account these relationships, their impacts, and the needed boundaries and necessary transparency to preserve our social and democratic values.","Law enforcement and national security agencies are pressuring governments for new methods of tapping into the huge amount of personal information collected by private sector companies such as Facebook. (Photo: JaysonPhotography / Shutterstock.com)","Data Security","Data security is a crucial issue for a national data strategy. Data security protects privacy, and it also protects against harmful criminal activity directed against individuals (for example, identity theft), corporations (for example, industrial espionage, disruption of services) and governments (for example, service disruptions, national security). Data security issues are currently addressed through data protection laws, on the one hand, and, on the other, through criminal-law sanctions. A growing number of high-profile data security breaches in the private and public sector have contributed to the growth industry in class action law suits for data breaches. And, while the losses mount, it is apparent that a great deal more needs to be done to improve data security practices and recourses.","Data Sovereignty","A national data strategy must pay attention to data sovereignty issues. A key element of data sovereignty relates to the ability to control what data leaves the country (thus escaping the protections put in place under domestic laws). The global nature of digital commerce, evolving practices around data storage in the cloud and offshore data processing all mean that a vast amount of data about Canadians is stored or communicated outside our borders. Such data is accessible to government actors in the countries where it is stored, raising privacy and security questions for Canadians. Yet in a high-stakes global trade environment, restrictions on flows of data (for example, requirements that particularly sensitive data be stored and/or processed only in Canada) may be seen as barriers to trade. This is evident in article 14.13 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which prohibits data localization requirements unless they fall within a limited exception.10 A national data strategy must take into account legitimate needs to protect certain types and categories of data, as well as the need for the development of appropriate infrastructure to do so.","Another aspect of data sovereignty arises in the context of Canada’s relationship with its Indigenous peoples. Indigenous leaders in Canada have been calling for Indigenous data sovereignty, generally along the lines of the ownership, control, access and possession (or OCAP) principles (Assembly of First Nations 2007). Indigenous data sovereignty is not only a crucial step toward self-government, but it may also hold lessons for Canadian governments about the importance of setting a national digital data strategy.","Data Justice","A national data strategy should also be concerned about issues of data justice, broadly defined. Data justice involves fairness, transparency and equity. It affects all areas of society and social interaction. To the extent that government and private sector decision making will increasingly be driven by algorithms, algorithmic transparency has become a crucial social justice issue, yet it is one that our laws are not well-adapted to address. Governments will also need to pay greater attention to what data is used to shape decision making and will need to ensure that social inequities are not replicated in data-driven processes. The rethinking of siloed legal responses to certain social justice issues should also be part of this agenda.","Conclusion","This brief overview is meant to illustrate the need for a national data strategy and to outline some of its necessary features. In the absence of new law and policy, existing laws will be interpreted to apply in this new context, and policies will continue to emerge on an ad hoc basis. But an incremental, wait-and-see approach does nothing to establish innovative new directions or strategies. It can create uncertainty that is harmful to innovation and progress; it can create barriers to access to and reuse of data that might serve the public interest; and it leaves the rights of stakeholders, as well as the public interest, to be determined in the context of fragmented litigation between well-financed private parties, whose interests reflect only a small subset of the diverse ecosystem that is emerging and evolving around data.","1 SC 2000, c 5.2 See, for example, Food and Drugs Act, RSC 1985, c F-27, s 21.1.3 For example, the information commissioner of Canada has called for a public interest override that would permit the disclosure of information withheld under one of the statutory exceptions to access where it is in the public interest.

They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text I’ve sent.","But in a statement issued this week, Facebook subtly rebuked the outrage, explaining they disclose their practice when users sign up:","“The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it’s a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts…","“Contact uploading is optional. People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone – it’s explained right there in the apps when you get started. People can delete previously uploaded information at any time and can find all the information available to them in their account and activity log from our Download Your Information tool.” [emphasis added]","Facebook has been exploiting user data for quite some time, though it now faces heightened criticism in the context of Donald Trump’s rise to power. But South Park, the long-running, highly-controversial adult animated series, actually offered biting commentary years ago on the subject of users signing away their rights.","In its Season 15 premiere, aired in 2011, the show poked fun at consumers’ habit of agreeing to terms of service without ever reading the fine print. In a particularly grotesque South Park episode, the show imagines the now-deceased Steve Jobs kidnapping Apple users to be part of a “humancentiPad” experiment, attaching the users together “from mouth to anus.”","The consumers used in the experiment are outraged and horrified as they wait in a jail cell. When Kyle, a main character, is also rounded up to be part of the humancentiPad, another woman asks him, “You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions, too?”","“I just clicked ‘Agree.’ I didn’t read it,” she says frantically. “I was in a hurry, you see, and I-I didn’t know what I was agreeing to!”","In a later scene, Kyle says he wants out of the experiment, and Jobs hands him a contract to sign that the late Apple chief says will release him. “Fine, you don’t want to be part of this? Then just sign right here,” Jobs tells him. Kyle quickly scribbles his signature, and Jobs immediately exclaims, “No! You didn’t read it! This says we don’t ever have to let you out and we can do whatever we want! Damn it, why won’t it read?” Jobs yells (“it” refers to his newly-created “humancentiPad,” comprised of multiple unsuspecting people who didn’t read the terms of service before they consented).","Though this South Park episode focuses on Apple — which has its own issues with data abuse — the sentiment is easily applicable to other giant companies.","To be sure, there’s no doubt Facebook and other companies should be in hot water for their abusive data policies. As Edward Snowden noted on Twitter last week:","“Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post.","“They are not victims. They are accomplices. Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as ‘surveillance companies’. Their rebranding as ‘social media’ is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.”","Nevertheless, without some semblance of self-responsibility from the users who agreed to submit to these practices, it’s doubtful anything will change.","…We have a small favor to ask. Fewer and fewer people are seeing Anti-Media articles as social media sites crack down on us, and advertising revenues across the board are quickly declining. However, unlike many news organizations, we haven’t put up a paywall because we value open and accessible journalism over profit — but at this point, we’re barely even breaking even. Hopefully, you can see why we need to ask for your help. Anti-Media’s independent journalism and analysis takes substantial time, resources, and effort to produce, but we do it because we believe in our message and hope you do, too.","If everyone who reads our reporting and finds value in it helps fund it, our future can be much more secure. For as little as $1 and a minute of your time, you can support Anti-Media. Thank you. Click here to support us"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

You shouldn’t have to wade through complicated privacy settings in order to ensure that the companies with which you’ve entrusted your personal information are making reasonable, legal efforts to protect it. But Facebook has allowed third parties to violate user privacy on an unprecedented scale, and, while legislators and regulators scramble to understand the implications and put limits in place, users are left with the responsibility to make sure their profiles are properly configured.","Over the weekend, it became clear that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company, got access to more than 50 million Facebook users’ data in 2014. The data was overwhelmingly collected, shared, and stored without user consent. The scale of this violation of user privacy reflects how Facebook’s terms of service and API were structured at the time. Make no mistake: this was not a data breach. This was exactly how Facebook’s infrastructure was designed to work.","In addition to raising questions about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election, this news is a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks that users face when their personal information is captured, analyzed, indefinitely stored, and shared by a constellation of data brokers, marketers, and social media companies.","Tech companies can and should do more to protect users, including giving users far more control over what data is collected and how that data is used. That starts with meaningful transparency and allowing truly independent researchers—with no bottom line or corporate interest—access to work with, black-box test, and audit their systems. Finally, users need to be able to leave when a platform isn’t serving them — and take their data with them when they do.","Of course, you could choose to leave Facebook entirely, but for many that is not a viable solution, unfortunately. For now, if you’d like keep your data from going through Facebook’s API, you can take control of your privacy settings. Keep in mind that this disables ALL platform apps (like Farmville, Twitter, or Instagram) and you will not be able to log into sites using your Facebook login.","If disabling platform entirely is too much, there is another setting that can help: limiting the personal information accessible by apps that others use. By default, other people who can see your info can bring it with them when they use apps, and your info becomes available to those apps.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

{"originalurl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp","title":"Flawed reporting about WhatsApp | Open door | Paul Chadwick | Opinion | The Guardian","text":["‘With so many users, watchfulness, news, analysis and debate about the security of WhatsApp are important.’\nPhotograph: Ritchie B. Tongo/EPA","The Guardian was wrong to report in January that the popular messaging service WhatsApp had a security flaw so serious that it was a huge threat to freedom of speech.","But it was right to bring to wide public notice an aspect of WhatsApp that had the potential to make some messages vulnerable to being read by an unintended recipient.","The Guardian did not test with an appropriate range of experts a claim that had implications for the more than one billion people who use the Facebook-owned WhatsApp.","In a detailed review I found that misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings happened at several stages of the reporting and editing process. Cumulatively they produced an article that overstated its case.","The Guardian ought to have responded more effectively to the strong criticism the article generated from well-credentialled experts in the arcane field of developing and adapting end-to-end encryption for a large-scale messaging service.","The original article – now amended and associated with the conclusions of this review – led to follow-up coverage, some of which sustained the wrong impression given at the outset. The most serious inaccuracy was a claim that WhatsApp had a “backdoor”, an intentional, secret way for third parties to read supposedly private messages. This claim was withdrawn within eight hours of initial publication online, but withdrawn incompletely. The story retained material predicated on the existence of a backdoor, including strongly expressed concerns about threats to freedom, betrayal of trust and benefits for governments which surveil. In effect, having dialled back the cause for alarm, the Guardian failed to dial back expressions of alarm.","This made a relatively small, expert, vocal and persistent audience very angry. Guardian editors did not react to an open letter co-signed by 72 experts in a way commensurate with the combined stature of the critics and the huge number of people potentially affected by the story. The essence of the open letter and a hyperlink to it were added to the article, but wider consultation and a fundamental reconsideration of the story were needed.","The aspect of WhatsApp at the heart of this matter, put very simply, is as follows. When a user of WhatsApp is offline, any messages at that time in transit to him or her are held in Facebook’s servers. (If unclaimed after 30 days they are deleted, Facebook advised.) If, while offline, the recipient registers a new device, any messages waiting for the person on Facebook’s servers are no longer deliverable because they are encrypted for the person’s old device. To prevent those messages from being lost, when the intended recipient comes back online, any in-transit messages are re-encrypted with the new device’s key and resent automatically. If senders have turned on a notification setting in WhatsApp on their phone, they are told that the key has changed, but not otherwise.","Critics said that the Guardian article overstated the risk of what is known in the jargon as a man-in-the-middle attack, in which a third party could exploit the combination of offline phone, messages in transit and changed key to intercept private communications.","The intensity of the external criticism seems to have stemmed partly from frustration that the article was in the Guardian, with its deserved reputation for using and reporting on technology in ways that help bridge the gap between non-experts and specialists.","Some were concerned that an overstated claim in the Guardian about risk to the security of WhatsApp would cause non-expert users to become unduly worried and needlessly abandon WhatsApp for less secure communication methods.","The critics had two different groups of WhatsApp users in mind.","First, the vast majority of users, for whom WhatsApp security is fine and who would probably experience worse communications security if they stopped using it.","Second, a much smaller group, activists in authoritarian regimes, whose threat model means they need high security and for whom the popularity of WhatsApp means they can “blend into the crowd”. This group could be at serious risk if they abandoned WhatsApp for something less secure, or perhaps even for a service more secure but used by relatively few, because that might attract the authorities’ attention.","A related concern was that authoritarian governments could exploit the Guardian story to move against the use of encrypted messaging.","During the review I independently confirmed that a Turkish government official had used the article when, in effect, attempting to deter users from WhatsApp. It was also confirmed that some activists who had been in the process of switching from a less secure messaging service to WhatsApp became confused by the Guardian story. On available evidence, I am unable to conclude whether these effects were widespread. But one case is one too many.","I am not an expert in this field. For the review I consulted suitably experienced experts other than the 72 who had already declared their view.","I found a consensus that in practice, as WhatsApp is presently understood, it would be very difficult to use this aspect of WhatsApp for systematic targeted surveillance. Experts described challenges with timing, targeting and concealment which they said would be formidable even for a major private or public actor with access to Facebook servers.","Experts were unanimous that it is not a backdoor. “Vulnerability” is a contested term, acceptable in this context to some but not all. One called it a “weakness”, others a “trade-off”.","One expert called WhatsApp “pretty excellent security against broad surveillance and that is valuable”. Another said the trade-off was reasonable. A third said: “This product is safe for the majority of people.”","I conveyed to Facebook one specialist’s proposal that the relevant notification setting should be default opt-out, not default opt-in, so that although in-transit messages would continue to be resent automatically, at least senders would be informed that it had happened unless they turned the notification setting off. Facebook replied: “Yes, WhatsApp considered this but decided against it when considering how it might be interpreted by the average user, who may be using a smartphone for the first time. Instead we chose to make this option available to those wanting an extra layer of security on their accounts.”","Experts confirmed that weighing these kinds of considerations about user behaviour is normal when designers are deciding the balance between security and usability in a mass-market service like WhatsApp. The experts confirmed the gist of the responses to the core Guardian article blogged on the day of its publication by two leading figures in developing WhatsApp, Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton.","Several independent experts agreed with this part of the open letter’s criticism when it was read to them:","“It’s important to recognize the tendency of many security researchers, especially inexperienced ones, to overestimate the practical impact of vulnerabilities they find, and being ignorant how security needs play out in the real world, the massive amount of work on actual user behavior in the face of friction and warnings, and the need for independent verification and context.”","I accept the consensus view of the experts and, in consultation with editors, have arranged for the coverage to be amended and for a note to be added drawing attention to the review and linking to this column.","I do not agree with critics that the story should be entirely retracted. After all the surrounding controversy, the story’s complete disappearance would be odd. More importantly, there is a clear public interest in the Guardian preserving (with appropriate amendments) reporting on this aspect of WhatsApp and the inherent trade-off. With so many users, watchfulness, news, analysis and debate about the security of WhatsApp are important. Communications privacy is a key element of human rights in the digital era, and developments affecting it ought to be reported. Also, Facebook needs scrutiny, both generally due to its power and specifically in its management of WhatsApp.","Facebook’s plan last year to share within its group of companies WhatsApp users’ personal information caused controversy and appeared to breach prior commitments. Regulators stepped in, including in the UK. At least one court has upheld a regulator’s intervention.","As one expert noted, Facebook’s servers are a black box. It is not possible for outsiders to verify exactly what happens when messages pass through Facebook’s servers on their way to and from WhatsApp users. Trust is required. Given Facebook’s record, steady scrutiny is the right stance.","We learned from Edward Snowden’s disclosures that large service providers which handle the communications of millions of people have been compromised in the past. Sections of a research paper published in March 2017 provide a more recent review of encryption workarounds.","The UK home secretary, Amber Rudd, has wondered aloud whether service providers should continue to be able lawfully to deny to government authorities access to encrypted messaging. Measures affecting the security of encrypted messaging seem likely to be among new anti-terrorism proposals.","Since the Guardian article, WhatsApp has been better secured by the introduction of optional two-factor verification in February. That process was being tested in November 2016 and had been reported in a specialist blog in July 2016, so the Guardian coverage did not prompt the improvement. We will probably never know whether it spurred Facebook to accelerate the process."],"isopubdate":"2017-06-28"}

Mercer was also a major donor to Trump’s election campaign.","It was Bannon’s first public appearance and statement since the explosive reports by the Observer and the Guardian, sister publications, last weekend, that the personal data of about 50 million Americans had been harvested and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.","The international data analytics operation, which worked with Trump’s election team, scraped millions of Facebook profiles of US voters and information about their social media friends, then used them for political propaganda.","It is one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and the data gleaned was used to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","The tech firm used personal information in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements, tech whistleblower and former employee Christopher Wylie told the Observer.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on,” Wylie said.","Cambridge Analytica has denied Wylie’s claims, and said that it had deleted all of the Facebook data once it became aware of how it had been obtained.","Bannon was speaking in New York on Thursday afternoon, at a conference organized by the Financial Times called The Future of News. In an on-stage interview, Bannon was quizzed by Lionel Barber, the editor of the FT.","He joked that the name Cambridge Analytica was “a stroke of genius” and said: “I helped put the company together.”","He said he would “rather not” talk about Alexander Nix, who was suspended as the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday after he was caught on tape boasting to British undercover reporters about offering fake stings and honey traps to clients wishing to discredit their political opponents in elections.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said before Nix’s suspension: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever … We routinely undertake conversations with prospective clients to try to tease out any unethical or illegal intentions.”","But Bannon denied there was any scandal involving companies acquiring people’s personal information from Facebook and using it for other purposes.","“It’s just about the cost of it. It’s bought and sold every day, it’s just a marketplace,” he said, adding: “I didn’t even know about the Facebook mining, that’s Facebook’s business ...

Wisconsin Right to Life Supreme Courtdecision ruled that issue ads can be aired in the months leading up to an election.","2008 Election Cycle: There was an explosion in electioneering communications, which are issue ads made within certain pre-election and pre-convention time periods.","2010: Citizens United v. FECSupreme Court decision loosened restrictions on corporate spending and made it possible for Dark Money groups to ramp up their independent expenditures.","2010: SpeechNow v. FEC Appeals Court decision allowed unlimited contributions to a new kind of \"indepdependent-expenditure only\" political action committees (PAC), now known as \"super PACs\".","2010 Election Cycle: Spending in the 2010 Election cycle grew by 196% up to $135.61 million.","2012 Election Cycle: The majority of the election spending by politically active nonprofits was in the form of direct appeals to vote for or against particular candidates, growing by 227% from the previous election cycle to $308.7 million.","2014 Election Cycle: Reported spending increased yet again, from $139 million in the 2010 midterms to $178 million, and groups bought tens of thousands of ads outside of periods when the ads have to be reported to the FEC.","2016 Election Cycle: While the uncertainty and confusion of the presidential election led many donors and politically active groups to avoid the presidential election, spending in House and Senate races from dark money groups remained high.","The totals below refer to the amount of political spending that 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) groups reported to the FEC.

Earlier Tuesday, the chairman of the U.K. parliamentary media committee, Damian Collins, said his group has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data. He said Facebook officials \"have been misleading to the committee.\"","The committee summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify.","\"It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,\" Collins wrote Zuckerberg. \"Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to 'fixing' Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.\"","Leading Democrats in the U.S. Senate also called on Zuckerberg to testify.

At the gathering, Trump plans to ask policy executives from tech companies to detail how they’ve sought to address digital ills plaguing Web users, such as the rise of online trolls and the spread of malicious content, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss her efforts on the record.","But the people said they don’t expect the first lady to unveil any policy proposals to combat cyberbullying — a term her team has sought to avoid, instead opting to focus on the need for kindness online.","Asked about the upcoming event, a spokeswoman for Trump said in a statement that the first lady had \"simply asked for a meeting to discuss one of the many things that impacts children.\" The spokeswoman declined to provide additional details.","Others fault President Trump for contributing to the lack of civility online, particularly through his tweets attacking opponents. Some of his most popular tweets in 2017 — garnering hundreds of thousands of replies, likes or retweets among his roughly 49 million followers — involved rhetorical broadsides aimed at North Korea and CNN.","For her part, Melania Trump first pledged to highlight and fight cyberbullying in November 2016, days before her husband won the White House. At the time, she lamented the fact that “our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and to teenagers.”","Following the inauguration, however, the first lady addressed cyberbullying only in a few public settings. That includes a high-profile address at the United Nations in September 2017, where she emphasized the need to “teach each child the values of empathy and communication that are at the core of kindness, mindfulness, integrity and leadership, which can only be taught by example.”","More recently, Trump appeared to be telegraphing a policy push to come: She hired new aides, including a director of policy, in January. The first lady publicly returned to the issue of cyberbullying last month in the wake of the Parkland shooting.","In February, student Lauren Hogg tweeted Melania Trump to express frustration that Trump's stepson, Donald Trump Jr., had liked tweets suggesting that survivors of the attack had been coached to speak to media and cover for the FBI. Days later, during her speech praising the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas HighSchool, Trump spoke about the need for more civility online and the importance of “positive habits with social media and technology.”","For its part, Silicon Valley has struggled to combat abuse and harassment online. In a study from the Pew Research Center last year, for example, 41 percent of Americans said they had personally experienced some form of harassment on the Web — for myriad reasons including their gender, ethnicity or physical appearance.","Along with representatives from Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snap and Twitter, at the first lady's meeting will be top aides from Microsoft and the Internet Association, a lobbying organization for Silicon Valley, as well as consumer groups, the people said.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.","Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it \"would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue\", said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems. Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.","Shares in Facebook fell on Monday by 7 percent, their biggest drop since 2014, wiping nearly $40 billion off the value of the firm founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg.","Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.","Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for \"strategic litigation\" over GDPR privacy violations.","According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then US presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","\"The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn't adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,\" said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.","Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.","Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to \"to give much less data, especially about friends,\" Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday.","\"We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,\" the company said on Monday. \"We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.\"","Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook's overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.","The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.","\"If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,\" Deutsche Bank warned.","The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.","Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his 'sell' rating on Facebook after the weekend reports. Wieser expressed concerns that the company's regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.","A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is. But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems Inc <PEGA.O>, which makes sales and marketing software.","PageFair, an Irish startup that helps website deliver non-targeted ads and avoid ad-blocking, estimates that only 3 percent of European social media users will opt-in to targeted ads, a potentially \"devastating\" blow for Facebook and other platforms, says Johnny Ryan, PageFair's head of ecosystem.","GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROL","The quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.","GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans' consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.","Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.","\"There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,\" she told Reuters.","Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.","For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.","The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.","Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented \"in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.\"","In other words, the days of extensive \"terms of service\" agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.","In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more \"permissions screens\" and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.","That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month. \"Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there's some potential that people decide they're not going to use the product,\" Wehner said. \"We don't think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

But Mark Zuckerberg has insulated himself, ensuring his job is secure.","It's possible that politicians may eventually rap the Facebook(FB) CEO's knuckles. Customers might revolt. Shareholders could one day even call for Zuckerberg to step down -- although that seems doubtful.","But it's unlikely anyone will be able to force Zuckerberg to make significant changes to how the company is run in the foreseeable future.","That's because Zuckerberg owns more than 75% of Facebook's class B stock, which get 10 shareholder votes -- compared to the one vote for an ordinary Facebook investor who owns the A shares that are traded on Wall Street.","In other words, Zuckerberg doesn't have to listen to what Wall Street says. But should he make even bigger changes?","Politicians in the United States and in Europe are calling on Zuckerberg to look into how the social network's user data may have been compromised after data firm Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Trump's campaign, reportedly gained access to information from approximately 50 million Facebook users.","Facebook disclosed Friday it is no longer allowing Cambridge Analytica to use its platform.","Still, that hasn't been enough to stop investors from worrying how all the Russia/Trump/Cambridge drama will hurt the company over the long haul. It is starting to take its toll on Facebook's stock too.","Shares of Facebook fell nearly 7% Monday, erasing all of the company's gains for 2018 in the process.","Daniel Ives, head of technology research, for GBH Insights, wrote in a report that \"Facebook has yet again found itself on the wrong side of political headwinds and angst.\"","Ives added that the suspension of Cambridge Analytica from its data platform \"now throws Zuckerberg & Co. squarely back into this heated debate and regulatory crosshairs of both the Beltway and EU.\"","To be sure, marketers may not flee Facebook because of these problems just yet.","\"The company's business won't likely be meaningfully impacted for now because we don't think advertisers will suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform,\" said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, in a report.","Nonetheless, Wieser still has that rarest of ratings -- a \"sell\" -- on Facebook stock.","That's because he thinks \"there are limits to the company's growth\" given how big Facebook already is and that \"costs and capital expenditures will continue to rise as the company grows and makes efforts to sustain its user base.\"","But Wall Street is already nervous that Facebook may be maturing in its home market. The company's daily active users in North America -- while a still impressive 184 million in North America -- fell from a year ago for the first time ever last quarter.","Political problems are the last thing that Facebook needs as it tries to convince users and investors that its best days aren't behind it.","Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament, tweeted Monday morning that \"allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens' privacy rights\" and that the European Parliament planned to investigate.","And US senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota and member of the Senate's Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter Saturday that the Cambridge Analytica news represents a \"major breach \" that Congress must look at as well.","\"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves.

But the data came from someone who didn’t hack the system: a professor who originally told Facebook he wanted it for academic purposes.","He set up a personality quiz using tools that let people log in with their Facebook accounts, then asked them to sign over access to their friend lists and likes before using the app. The 270,000 users of that app and their friend networks opened up private data on 50 million people, according to the New York Times. All of that was allowed under Facebook’s rules, until the professor handed the information off to a third party.","Facebook said it found out about Cambridge Analytica’s access in 2015, after which it had the firm certify that it deleted the data. On Friday, Facebook said it now knows Cambridge actually kept it — an infraction that got Cambridge suspended from the social network. Once that was announced, executives quickly moved on to defending Facebook’s security.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,’’ longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said on Twitter. “People chose to share their data with third-party apps and if those third-party apps did not follow the agreements with us/users it is a violation.’’ Alex Stamos, Facebook’s head of security, echoed the same arguments. Cambridge denied doing anything illegal or using the information in the 2016 presidential election; Facebook says it has no way of knowing how or whether the data was used for targeting in the Trump campaign.","Facebook’s advertising business depends on users sharing their most personal data via its social network. But the company’s “not a breach” argument isn’t likely to make users feel any safer or more comfortable doing so — especially given that it’s already under fire for missing that Russian actors were purchasing U.S. election ads on the site to sway voter opinions, as well as running fake accounts disguised as real Americans. The company has also been fending off accusations that it’s too slow to notice or react to harmful content.","U.K. Inquiry","The latest incident has raised new questions about what technical guardrails Facebook has in place to prevent authorized users from sharing sensitive information, and how much visibility the company has into how outsiders use the data.","Facebook wouldn’t comment on those questions, saying only that it has made significant improvements in its ability to “detect and prevent violations” by app developers, such as random audits of applications using its tools to make sure they’re following the rules. And it’s no longer letting developers who use Facebook’s login tools see information on their users’ friends.","In London, the head of a parliamentary committee said he will ask Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to send a senior executive to testify as part of its inquiry into fake news. Damien Collins, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said it’s not acceptable for companies to send witnesses who avoid responding to questions “by claiming not to know the answers.”","The disclosure of Facebook’s actions also underscores it’s continuing struggle to anticipate negative consequences of its lack of oversight – in some cases taking action only after things go wrong. The company in the past two years has worked to understand and counteract the spread of misinformation on its site, the use of its automated advertising system for racist targeting, the proliferation of fake user accounts, the spread of violent video, and more.","But when the company tries to explain what it’s doing, it grapples with the perception that it’s shirking responsibility for its problems, treating them as public-relations snafus instead of serious product flaws.","Stamos, the Facebook security executive, deleted his original tweets on Cambridge Analytica, saying he wasn’t so good at “talking about these things in the reality of 2018.” Specifically, he said he didn’t know how to balance his personal beliefs with his responsibility to Facebook and his co-workers, amid all the criticism.","“We have collectively been too optimistic about what we build and our impact on the world,” Stamos wrote Saturday on Twitter. “Believe it or not, a lot of the people at these companies, from the interns to the CEOs, agree.”"],"isopubdate":""}

Britain’s information commissioner announced on Monday that she is seeking a warrant to search the company’s office and servers for any evidence of illegal activity.","It’s been an eventful few days for the data firm. The drama all began over the weekend with an internal whistleblower coming forward to say that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the personal data on 50 million Facebook users through a method that violated Facebook’s terms of service. Then, on Monday, the UK’s Channel 4 ran the second part of an ongoing investigation into Cambridge Analytica’s shady political practices.","Advertisement","The segment from Channel 4 featured undercover video of a man identified as Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, speaking with reporters he believed to be potential clients. From Channel 4:","In one exchange, when asked about digging up material on political opponents, Mr Nix said they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house”, adding that Ukrainian girls “are very beautiful, I find that works very well”.","In another he said: “We’ll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance, we’ll have the whole thing recorded, we’ll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the Internet.”","Offering bribes to public officials is an offence under both the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Cambridge Analytica operates in the UK and is registered in the United States.","Advertisement","After the segment aired, Britain’s Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, appeared for an interview with Channel 4's Jon Snow. Denham said that her office “has been carrying out an investigation into data analytics and political profiling and micro-targeting for several months now. And we have heard similar allegations during our investigation.”","The commissioner emphasized that Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are only one part of their investigation, which involves 30 organizations and was started with the intent of explaining to the public what happens to their personal data during political campaigning. Denham said that she issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica on March 7th and that she was not satisfied with its response. She said that her office will formally request the warrant tomorrow, and she is seeking access to the computers and property of the firm.","Facebook’s own forensic investigators will soon begin an independent review of Cambridge Analytica’s systems, according to an announcement today. Denham said that “Facebook has been cooperative with us and has provided a great deal of information about the 50 million profiles. We’re waiting on more information, but it’s Cambridge Analytica that has been uncooperative with our investigation.”","Advertisement","We’ve reached out to Cambridge Analytica for comment but did not receive an immediate reply. Considering how much emphasis the man identified as Nix in the video puts on client privacy, we’re going to go out on a limb and guess that the company isn’t very pleased.","The Washington Post reported on Monday that “Cambridge Analytica earned more than $16 million from 2014 to 2016 from nearly 20 Republican candidates and political committees.” The campaign to elect Donald Trump for president accounted for $5.9 million of that in 2016, according to FEC filings.","Update 6:50pm: Facebook has confirmed that auditors from Stroz Friedberg, the digital forensics firm it hired to conduct the probe of Cambridge Analytica’s servers, were asked to leave by UK authorities. “At the request of the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Stroz Friedberg auditors stood down,” Facebook said in a statement."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

{"originalurl":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techcrunch/facebook/~3/_xBc9pzSVjs/","title":"Trump campaign-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica reportedly collected info on 50M Facebook profiles – TechCrunch","text":["Cambridge Analytica had worked with University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, who had developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” and obtained user information — which the Times is reporting scooped up information on profiles of as many as 50 million users. Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I'm going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

If we can’t, we don’t deserve it,” Facebook said in the advertisement published with its logo.\nFacebook is under growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States and is trying to repair its reputation among users, advertisers, lawmakers and investors.\nThe development comes against the background of allegations that a British consultancy firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly gained access to users’ information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.\nA U.S. Senator, Mark Warner, and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Facebook had not been “fully forthcoming” over how Cambridge Analytica used its data.\nHe also reiterated calls for Mr Zuckerberg to testify before U.S. lawmakers, saying Facebook and other internet companies had been reluctant to confront “the dark underbelly of social media” and how it can be manipulated.\nLast week, Facebook shares tumbled 14 per cent as the hashtag #DeleteFacebook gained traction online.\nReuters reports that its online poll found that 41 per cent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information, compared with 66 per cent who said they trust Amazon.com Inc, 62 percent who trust Alphabet Inc’s Google, 60 per cent for Microsoft Corp.\nThe poll was conducted from Wednesday through Friday and had 2,237 responses.\nThe German poll published by Bild was conducted by Kantar EMNID, a unit of global advertising holding company WPP, using representative polling methods, the firm said. Overall, only 33 percent found social media had a positive effect on democracy, against 60 percent who believe the opposite.\nThere are concerns on whether people across the globe would boycott the social media network following the scandal.\n“It’s psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that’s become pretty well ingrained into people’s lives,” said eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson.\nThe firm at the centre of the Facebook controversies, Cambridge Analytica, was also alleged to have attempted to influence the 2015 presidential election in Nigeria in favour of the then incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan.\nA damning report published by the UK Guardian revealed how the foreign firm was hired to do the dirty job by an unnamed Nigerian oil billionaire who was afraid of Mr. Jonathan losing the presidential election, the paper reported on Wednesday.\nMr Jonathan seemed to be referring to the allegations Sunday when he said some individuals were out to destroy his image.\n“What I will say however, is that no matter how far and fast falsehood has traveled, it must eventually be overtaken by truth,” the former president said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

I was recently at a gathering of experts who work in post-conflict countries, and all present agreed: Reconstructing a nation — any nation, whether Libya or East Timor — requires the establishment of a framework for national debate. If nothing else, leaders of the conflict have to agree about why the war ended, why they decided to stop fighting and what will happen next. Then they have to transmit that agreement to their followers. But if this is impossible — because “mainstream” media don’t exist, because Facebook offers conflicting versions of the truth, because no one trusts what they read — then peace is impossible, too.","Poor democracies are equally vulnerable. In countries — and there are more than you think — where reputable, fact-checked, independent media don’t function (because they’re too expensive, because the Internet destroyed the advertising market, because illiberal governments put pressure on the media), then the possibility of civilized conversation disappears, too. If different versions of the truth appear in different online versions; if no one can agree upon what actually happened yesterday; if fake, manipulated or mendacious news websites are backed up by mobs of Internet trolls; then conspiracy theories, whether of the far left or far right, will soon have the same weight as reality. Politicians who lie will be backed by a claque of supporters.","Rich democracies haven’t realized that this is also fast becoming their problem. Whenever I’ve described the disappearance of facts and the growth of Internet fantasy while in London or Washington, the response has usually been rather smug: How very terrible for all of those people in Tunisia or Slovakia, but “it couldn’t happen here.” But it can and it has: Donald Trump claimed that “thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey cheered the collapse of the World Trade Center, and thousands of real commenters and bloggers rushed to his defense on Facebook and elsewhere. Never mind that it didn’t happen: It is now possible to live in a virtual reality where Trump’s lies are acclaimed as the hidden truth that the mainstream media have concealed from the masses.","Those who don’t live in Trump’s world can find alternatives, of course. Ali Amin, a Virginia teenager, was so entranced by the world of online jihad that he became “absorbed in a ‘virtual’ struggle while disconnecting from what was real.” He wound up with an 11-year prison sentence for providing material support to a terrorist group. Nor is that kind of experience reserved for jihadis. Anyone who spends any time in the many alternative worlds that can be accessed via Twitter or Facebook can encounter similarly false information, in many forms and in many languages, every day. Just follow the right Twitter accounts, and you’ll get links to the fake websites and dubious organizations that produce invented statistics. You’ll find friends who believe in the invented statistics, too. If you so desire, you can then go on to live in a bubble entirely divorced from any reality except one created by far-right bloggers, left-wing anarchists or Kremlin spin doctors, all of whom excel at developing this kind of alternate reality.","Many of those who do the inventing have particular political goals, such as the election of Trump, or the recruitment of Islamic State volunteers. But the longer-term impact of disinformation is even more profound: It creates cynicism and apathy. Eventually it means that nobody believes anything. People aren’t bothered by Trump’s lies — or Vladimir Putin’s lies, or the Islamic State’s lies — because they don’t believe anything they read anyway. There’s so much garbage information out there, it’s impossible to know what is true.","Nobody yet knows what to do about this sea change, because few people have even accepted that it is happening or understand how it works. There’s a wide-open space for Zuckerberg to help journalists, academics, activists and politicians figure out how to bring reality back into public debate. Maybe we need to study “media literacy” in schools; maybe we need independent “accuracy indexes” to rate websites; maybe we need to work on understanding the psychology of conspiracy theorists. We don’t know yet what works, but it’s time we started trying to figure it out. And that is a $45 billion question.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Anne ApplebaumAnne Applebaum is a Washington Post columnist, covering national politics and foreign policy, with a special focus on Europe and Russia.

Yet until recently, no one in the public – nor most insiders at Facebook and other tech companies – were aware of how severe the privacy breach was.","This combination of information, which can be used to build an unsettlingly complex psychological profile of each user, was being harvested from Facebook users by external developers and passed along to any interested party (like shady political campaigners) without any oversight.","Now, Mozilla is hoping that Facebook Container can provide a little peace of mind for users who are concerned but want to continue using the social media platform.","As noted by The Verge, the extension will reduce targeted advertisements, but it would not have been able to prevent the flow of personal data at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica debacle.

The report contained two key findings and subsequent recommendations about Facebook’s policies around account deactivation and deletion:","Because account deactivation and deletion are not explained in the same part of the site, some users may believe that their only option is to “deactivate” their account. The report suggested making the account deletion option more prominent.","Today, the situation remains much the same. Visiting the settings page on Facebook shows the option to “Manage Account” under your General Account Settings. This brings up options about what will happen to your Facebook account when you die. You can set a legacy contact or just choose to have your account permanently deleted.","There’s no clear option on how to delete your account while you’re still alive. The option to “Deactivate your account” is still prominently displayed here. This is how Facebook explains this option:","“Deactivating your account will disable your Profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook. Some information may still be visible to others, such as your name in their Friends list and messages that you’ve sent.”","Clicking on the “Learn More” link leads to a tutorial with graphics detailing the steps to deactivate an account. This tutorial addresses permanent deletion and links to the “Help Center,” where the link to “Delete my account” is shared. In Facebook’s help centre, it says it may take up to 90 days for Facebook to delete all account data from backup systems. In 2009, that timeline was 14 days.","Despite the commissioner’s recommendation to eventually delete data of deactivated accounts, Facebook continues to hold it indefinitely. Facebook maintains that most users that choose to deactivate will reactivate their accounts within a few weeks, and expect their social connections to be maintained upon returning.","Many Canadians are looking to delete their Facebook accounts after a #DeleteFacebook campaign became popular following the news breaking about Cambridge Analytica. But with Facebook refusing to follow the guidelines of privacy regulators, you wonder how many of them will succeed in purging their personal data from Facebook’s servers.","CIPPIC makes the point that its 2008 complaint raised concerns about how Facebook provides access to user data to developers. Tamir Israel, a staff lawyer with CIPPIC, says Cambridge Analytica was able to access 50 million users’ data because Facebook’s API allowed access to all data deemed ‘publicly available’ at the time.","While Facebook’s list of information considered ‘public’ by default is now shorter, it still includes age range, language, and country, in addition to name, gender, user ID, profile picture, cover photo, and networks.","Developers still have access to this public information, Israel says.","“This is an ongoing example of the pressing need to turn PIPEDA into an enforceable regulatory regime,” Israel says. “When limited to non-binding recommendations, the OPC is simply not able to enforce the law the way it should be applied.”","For its part, Facebook provided information on background when it was asked to comment on this story. It says it added a new section to its help documentation that makes deleting an account easier to accomplish. It confirms that deactivated account information is still retained indefinitely."],"isopubdate":""}

Is it time to break up with the social media giant, one of the most effective marketing tools that planners use to share meetings magic?","What Actually Happened?","Facebook announced on March 16 that the data-analysis firm Cambridge Analytica (which played an important role in the online strategy for Trump’s 2016 campaign), had been suspended from using the social-media platform for mishandling data of more than 50 million users. According to Facebook, the information was gathered in 2014 from the thisisyourdigitallife app, created by Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan.","In 2015, Facebook learned that Kogan had sold the data to Cambridge Analytica without user consent, a violation of Facebook’s policy. Facebook ordered Cambridge Analytica to destroy all stolen data and to provide a formal legal certification confirming it had done so.","Though Cambridge Analytica provided documentation, Facebook learned last week that it possibly didn’t follow through, leading to the suspension and investigation of the firm. It is uncertain as to whether the firm used the data to channel political ads towards users.","Facebook has since created new restrictions on developers and how they can access user data. It also has plans to create a new tool in the coming months to help users monitor their own data.","These new restrictions will start to affect the event industry, says Liz King Caruso, social media expert and founder of Techsytalk and Liz King Events. She says that event organizers may need to report their use of data on their attendees, speakers and sponsors, and will need to be hyperaware of data security.","“Everything from what data you collect, how you store it, who you share and sell it to, and what they do with it could change,” Caruso says. “There are several standard industry practices that are no longer going to be acceptable in the near future.”","Do I really need to worry?","According to Caruso, yes, you do.","“For all people using Facebook, this is a huge wake up call,” she says. Billions of people have made this free service a huge part of their lives, leaving their sensitive data vulnerable to many forms of monetizing.","“I think the big difference with Facebook is that people feel like it is a more private space, because you have to send and accept friend requests,” Caruso says. Facebook feels more private than other social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. But while consumers are focused on status updates and things they’re sharing with their network, Caruso says Facebook’s founders are much more interested in the activity data, which she calls, “a very dangerous combination.”","I Never Used the App, so I’m Safe, Right?","Maybe. Even if you didn’t use the app, your information could still be compromised. The app not only took data from the 270,000 people who used it, but also from the friends of those users, depending on what their privacy settings were set at in 2014.","No one knows who has purchased what personal data on the “dark web” in the last four years.","How Can I Stay Protected?","With Facebook being a major marketing tool for event planners, simply kicking it to the curb (#DeleteFacebook) may not be the best solution. But some simple steps could help protect you, your friends and your event attendees","1. Study up!","Do a top-to-bottom evaluation of your own privacy policies, and then communicate and enforce those policies.","2. Spring Clean Your Facebook Apps","Have you ever signed into a third-party website, played a game or used an app using your Facebook profile? Those services may still be accessing your data. From the settings page on your Facebook, click on the apps tab. From there, you can see which apps you have granted permission to and decide whether to remove them or not. In the same tab under app settings, click “apps others use,” and choose which details about you are shared when your friends use apps.","You can also protect yourself by auditing your Facebook privacy settings and minimizing the information you share publicly. For example, you can allow only your friends to see your posts.","3. Install a Tracker Blocker or an Ad Blocker","Add-ons such as Disconnect, Privacy Badger and uBlock Origin block trackers and advertisements embedded on websites. This may limit the functionality of some parts of websites, but it might be worth it for privacy’s sake.","4. Clear Your Browser History and Cookies","This will temporarily delete trackers that may be on sites used, but they might reappear over time, so make it a regular practice.","5. Read the Privacy Policies","Although it may seem like a waste of time to do so, and is easier to simply hit “I accept” privacy policies, you may be agreeing to something suspicious. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, don’t use the program.","6. Listen to Your Gut about Unknown Brands","The internet is still an unregulated space, with new programs, apps and viruses popping up constantly. Some sites may look legitimate, but on further review they are not. Even after reading the terms of service, think about it. In the case of thisisyourdigitallife, the fine print of the privacy policy said the information would be used for academic use, not commercial. If your first instinct is that it’s a sham, get out immediately.","About Us","Smart Meetings is the leading media company and most trusted resource for meeting professionals.

(NASDAQ:AMZN): Concerns Over Amazon a Big Story to Watch Today | StockNews.com","text":["Concerns Over Amazon a Big Story to Watch Today","This morning’s story about President Trump being super-focused and very concerned on what effect Amazon (AMZN) is having on competitors is likely one that will intensify and could mean pressures on the stock in the near-term. While this focus could take some attention away from Facebook’s (FD) PR troubles, it appears, the big internet giants (Google as well) may be getting closer to major regulations. Lots of chatter has been building in recent years as to how dominant the internet giants have become, but now Wall Street is waking up to the effect change/regulation could have on the stock prices. Yesterday’s sell-off caught many by surprise and with 2 days left in the quarter, and it’s anyone’s guess as to the potential for further selling. A couple of M&A deals on the tape are at least helping get futures in the green for the start of trading.","Each person who wants to succeed as an investor over the course of time needs to consider having an investing value system, one which they adopt and abide by despite the market conditions around them. The idea is to remain consistent in how money is deployed and to what type of assets fit the investor’s risk profile. I know some investors who are the most conservative, but they do fill their “cheat day-like” need by allocating a small percentage to taking on the most riskiest of stock bets. They earmark a certain dollar amount which they decide to roll the dice with each year. Normally they would like to see maturity before investing, but if the volatile bets they make connect, they feel like they have not ignored an area of the market that is up and coming. It helps to have a bit of excess capital to be able to do this. For some, the goal is to be disciplined while also leaving some wiggle room for human nature and wanting to explore, even if the endgame costs a bit more in terms of taking a loss. The education and experience is part of the journey for investors who do this. Whether you have excess capital to take on a bit of risk or not, the goal should be to know what your value system is and stay with it. You may decide you only buy dividend stocks because of the income attraction, and you’re okay if there is less growth. Again, you must decide whether it fits what you want to adopt as your own investing value system. Be consistent and stick to your plan to achieve long-term results.","We’re All Selling Something","It’s so true when you think about how life proceeds and how each aspect of life involves more and more selling of ideas, concepts, life lessons, etc. StockNews.com was free initially as we were building out our services and tools.

In short, what was Mark Zuckerberg thinking?","What makes recent disclosures about illicit uses of Facebook data so exasperating to opinion leaders and millions of everyday users is the delayed, disingenuous and tone-deaf responses from corporate management. It took five days from the publication of bombshell exposés in the New York Times and Observer, during which Facebook shed nearly $50 billion in market value, before the company’s two top executives finally issued what was widely considered to be an inadequate response.","During the protracted silence from Facebook’s CEO and COO, other senior company executives took to Twitter and Facebook to deny corporate culpability. One post vigorously disputed that Facebook’s systems had been breached, insisting on a technically correct, but blame-shifting explanation: “This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","This semantics lesson on the meaning of “breach” provided little comfort to users, who rarely parse the fine print in Facebook’s terms of service, and in any event expect Facebook to protect their private data from harmful and unauthorized use. As Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged in his long-awaited response (on Facebook of course), “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. “","In another instance of Facebook’s inadequate initial response, a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast, “The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","But Facebook’s outrage was too little, too late, as the cause of the company’s breach of trust should have been recognized and forcefully addressed over three years earlier. In 2014, a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan gave a publicized speech in Singapore, describing how he was able to analyze a sample of over 50 million Facebook users for whom he developed “the ability to predict virtually any trait.” Kogan also boasted of having built a database of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012.","One year later, The Guardian published a detailed account of how campaign consultancy Cambridge Analytica − who had paid to gain access to Kogan’s massive database on unwitting US Facebook users − was using detailed psychological profiles on the US electorate for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. In response, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to certify (as in “check the box on this form”) that they had destroyed the ill-gotten user data. But Facebook failed to pursue any forensic follow up to ensure that this dangerously potent asset had in fact been wiped clean.","In early 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and paid the firm over $6 million with the remit to provide a wide range of services including data analytics, voter profiling, micro-targeting, social media message development, digital marketing and campaign planning. Did Cambridge Analytica continue to use its ill-gotten massive Facebook database on behalf of the Trump campaign? Circumstantial evidence certainly points in that direction. Whistleblower Chris Wylie has recounted that Cambridge Analytica board member Steve Bannon had exhorted employees to weaponize psychological profiling in a self-proclaimed “win-at-any-cost” culture war being fought on the 2016 election battlefield. The Financial Times reported that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, boasted of using “a massive database of [nearly] 5,000 data points on every adult in America” to support the successful Trump campaign. And immediately after the election, Cambridge Analytica took credit for the win, claiming that its data helped to place targeted online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times.","In his belated mea culpa, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook “made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” But the company’s track record of systemic failures to protect user privacy or to prevent malevolent uses of its proprietary database suggests that were it not for investigative reporting by the New York Times, Observer and undercover reporting by Channel 4 News in London, we probably would not be having an urgent public discourse on Facebook’s management shortcomings today.","Why has Facebook consistently struggled to protect its users’ personal information and to prevent malicious exploitation of its platform?","Going forward, can we trust Facebook to “take whatever steps are required” to address serious concerns with their business practices?","The most common answer to the first question is that Facebook’s business model inexorably drives their observed behavior. After all, Facebook’s success is built on amassing (or less charitably, surveilling) information on consumer behavior, enabling it to sell targeted advertising that delivers superior marketing ROI. This devilishly effective business model has enabled Facebook to create an extraordinarily profitable enterprise – in round numbers, a $50 billion revenue run rate, growing at 50% per year with 50% operating margins. It is thus not surprising that the company would be reluctant to tinker with such successful business practices.","The Perfect Storm Behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Corporate Myopia","But there is deeper dynamic at play that explains Facebook’s chronic inability to recognize the potential societal harm and reputational risk that its platform can and has engendered. Mark Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia results from the perfect storm of three leadership mindsets.","Hubristic vision and soaring ambition to change the world for the better","Overconfidence in the power of technology to solve virtually any problem","A tendency to underestimate “black swan” risks","While these management mindsets are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, when applied in a company of Facebook’s scale, the consequences can be catastrophic.","Mark Zuckerberg passionately believes that the company he founded nearly fifteen years ago has emerged as a uniquely powerful global force for good. He has often proclaimed that the Internet should be considered, like health care and clean water, a basic human right. And within that realm, Zuckerberg regards peer-to-peer communications as a powerful enabler of the company’s mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”","Guided by such an altruistic vision, Zuckerberg propelled Facebook’s rapid growth by aggressively pursuing more data, more media, more interactions inside and beyond the platform, more functionality, more user engagement and more global scale and reach. But in retrospect, the company’s fateful error was Zuckerberg’s decision to share user data with outside app developers starting in 2008 (expanded further between 2011 and 2014) in exchange for enhancing Facebook’s functionality and the ability to track its users beyond its platform. By extending Facebook’s surveillance beyond the walled garden of internally generated user data, the company signaled its preference for more data acquisition and portability over safeguarding user privacy.","MAU growthAuthor analysis from company data","Along the way, Facebook certainly was aware of “bad actors” on its platform − the ones that bully users, plant fake news for profit, mindless fun or influence, or who promote fraudulent commerce. But Zuckerberg has consistently exuded confidence that his company’s sophisticated software could detect and prevent malevolent abuses on his platform, despite alarming evidence that Facebook’s bad actor problem has been worsening for years.","There were plenty of reasons for Zuckerberg to overlook danger signs bubbling below the surface of Facebook’s business. By any measure, Facebook had been spectacularly successful in creating a global juggernaut. By the end of 2017, Facebook was serving over 2 billion users and more than 5 million advertisers, rewarding shareholders (including its largest stakeholder, Mark Zuckerberg) with a company valued in excess of one-half trillion dollars.","Such outsized success undoubtedly contributed to Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia in failing to recognize and mitigate the risks of rare, but potentially catastrophic abuses on his platform. Best-selling author and scholar Nassim Taleb has written extensively on the common human tendency to underestimate the likelihood of “black swan” events − defined as situations with low probability but extremely high downside risk. For example, black swan myopia arguably contributed to the lax risk management that led to a number of preventable disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the financial services meltdown of 2008.","In Facebook’s case, black swan myopia led Mark Zuckerberg to largely ignore the reputational risk posed by the malevolent use of Facebook user data before, during and after the 2016 presidential election. Before Cambridge Analytica even began working for the Trump campaign, Facebook failed to verify that the consultancy had actually destroyed its large illicit cache of Facebook user data. During the campaign, Facebook continued to ignore growing reports that the Trump campaign was effectively deploying psychological profiling and micro-targeting techniques, rife with fake news and targeted imagery in pivotal swing states.","And even after President Trump’s gobsmacking victory, Zuckerberg continued to proclaim that the notion that fake news could have influenced the U.S. presidential election was a \"pretty crazy idea,\" going on to dismiss the importance of filter bubbles and claiming that fake news represents a \"very small volume\" of the total content on Facebook’s platform.","Zuckerberg’s stubborn denial of the ability of Cambridge Analytica and other foreign political operatives to exploit Facebook’s data and platform to influence voter behavior is bizarrely hypocritical, since the secret sauce that has always driven Facebook’s profitability is its proven ability to enable advertisers to precisely tailor product messaging to targeted prospective customers.","According to whistleblower Chris Wylie, Steve Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the stated objective of using psychological profiling tools to change voters’ cultural attitudes. In fighting a self-proclaimed culture war, Bannon understood that micro-targeting − akin to smart bombs − could be far more cost effective than carpet bombing political ads on mass media. Cambridge Analytica arguably was in a position to be particularly effective in this regard because they illicitly gained the access to Facebook’s vast user database to build detailed psychological profiling models.","Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in falling prey to the perfect storm of corporate myopia. One could argue that Travis Kalanick at Uber and Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos also had hubristic visions to change the world for the better, coupled with overconfidence in the infallibility of their technology and an inability to recognize black swan risks threatening to damage their company and the world at large. Kalanick was ultimately forced to resign from Uber by his board, and Holmes recently settled a lawsuit with the SEC that forced her to forfeit control of Theranos, now in tatters.","There are of course key differences in Zuckerberg’s case. Unlike the other two executives, Facebook has been spectacularly profitable, and Zuckerberg enjoys bulletproof shareholder control of his company. Under these circumstances, the question is, how will Mark Zuckerberg address the growing challenges threatening Facebook’s future?","Can Zuckerberg Clean Up Facebook’s Mess?","The key to answering this question lies in understanding what problem Mark Zuckerberg will choose to address: quelling the current uproar over the Cambridge Analytica debacle, or addressing broader, longstanding concerns with Facebook’s unprecedented global power to control access to information hiding behind its opaque business practices.","Zuckerberg’s mea culpa media tour starting March 21st clearly signaled his primary interest on the first problem. In his interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher, Zuckerberg opined “the good news is that as of three or four years ago, new apps weren’t able to do what happened here. So this is largely ... this issue is resolved going forward for a while.” As Swisher rightfully observed, Zuckerberg’s comments were predominantly backward-looking, and inadequately recognized the broader challenges that lie ahead.","By focusing Facebook’s attention on tracking down possible terms of service violations by thousands of third party developers many years ago, and promising new controls on developer platform access, Zuckerberg framed Facebook’s problem entirely in terms of external data portability, ignoring the fact that through these interactions, Facebook also amassed and retains extensive data on user behavior for its own commercial purposes.","Worries over just how much user data Facebook routinely collects and how that information is used erupted again this week when press accounts revealed that Facebook has been logging Android users’ telephone calls and SMS messages for years. As with prior concerns expressed over the company’s expansive data capture, Facebook reprised its typical response: “we never sell your data and trust us, having all this information helps us provide a better user experience on our platform.”","But a growing chorus of political leaders no longer trusts Facebook’s blame-shifting apologies and repeated assurances of altruistic intent, and are now calling for the company’s CEO to testify before Congress on a broad range of data privacy concerns. The FTC has also weighed in, opening an investigation to determine whether Facebook’s business practices have been violating a 2011 agreement settling charges over the company’s user privacy policies.","So how can we expect Facebook to respond? Given Mark Zuckerberg’s management mindset, and the company’s track record in dealing with past crises, it would take overwhelming pressure from the government or other key stakeholders for Facebook to move beyond reactive tweaks to its business practices. The harsh reality is, Facebook’s stakeholders are unlikely to mount a serious and sustained challenge to the company’s status quo.","Users","The potential for a user revolt clearly poses the gravest threat to Facebook’s market dominance, which explains why Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have devoted so much of their apology tour last week seeking to restore user trust. Facebook executives are well aware that Uber reportedly lost as much as 15 percentage points of market share in major US metro markets last year after a #deleteuber campaign erupted over the company’s alleged mishandling of its response to protests over President Trump’s Muslim country travel ban. In Uber’s case, consumers had a readily available choice to switch to a competitor (Lyft) offering an essentially comparable service.","Facebook’s situation is considerably different. Despite the genuine outrage expressed over recent damaging revelations, isolated calls to #deletefacebook have failed to gain much traction simply because Facebook is too deeply embedded in the lives of its 2 billion users. Consciously or unwittingly, the vast majority of Facebook users appear to have accepted the Faustian bargain of trading their personal data for free access to Facebook’s valued services. Don’t expect many Facebook or Instagram users to switch to Snapchat any time soon.","Advertisers","As long as users remain engaged on the platform, advertisers will be understandably reluctant to exclude Facebook from their advertising mix. No platform provides nearly as much market reach, targeting effectiveness or useful ROI tracking tools as Facebook. Consequently, why would Facebook’s 5 million advertisers be willing to cede such advantages to competitors? While a few companies have in fact announced a temporary suspension of Facebook advertising (e.g., Pep Boys, Sonos, Commerzbank), Facebook is likely to remain a dominant a channel for most advertisers in the months ahead.","Investors/Government","As long as users and advertisers stay on board, many investors are likely to follow suit. Facebook’s recent loss of market value largely reflects current investor nervousness over the prospect for restrictive government regulation. Mark Zuckerberg surprisingly fanned the flames of investor concern by signaling his support for appropriate regulatory controls.","But there are reasons to doubt that government action will be swift, comprehensive or overly damaging to Facebook’s business model. For starters, President Trump will obviously seek to discourage debate on an issue that relitigates the legitimacy of his 2016 election. On Capitol Hill, Congress already has a full agenda of more pressing political issues to deal with, going into the 2018 midterm elections. As such, today’s announcement that the FTC is launching an investigation of Facebook may give Congress cover to pass the baton in dealing with this gnarly issue.","It would not be surprising to see Facebook voluntarily announcing a few enhancements to its data privacy policies in the coming months to diminish the perceived urgency for comprehensive government regulation. These dynamics suggest that government action is likely to be slow and measured at best, giving investors time to monitor and react to Facebook’s actual financial performance in the months ahead, which promises to remain strong.","Board of directors","Facebook has a distinguished board that in normal circumstances could be counted on to exert strong oversight over the company's operational and reputational risk management. But a board can go only so far in reining in a CEO who controls 60% of the voting shares of the fifth largest publicly traded company in the world. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to be the loudest voice in the room in guiding Facebook’s strategic direction.","Competitors","What competitors? Facebook has exploited strong network economies of scale and a relentless appetite to acquire or replicate the services of upstart competitors. While it is true that Facebook will likely be barred from additional major acquisitions, the company has already built a seemingly unassailable lead over competitors in the advertising-supported social media space. Even if Congress does act to impose limits on future user data sourcing and portability, it may actually strengthen Facebook’s current competitive advantage given that it already has by far the biggest user database in the industry.","So where does that leave us? In the months ahead, we’re likely to see a number of incremental improvements in Facebook’s business practices through a combination of voluntary company policy changes and possible regulatory reforms governing the allowable sourcing and use of personal data.","Greater transparency in identifying the sponsors and content of targeted ads on Facebook’s platform (particularly those involving political content)","Tighter controls over user data portability across the Internet","More stringent requirements for users to be asked for opt-in permission (in clear language) before Facebook can collect and store user data.","These welcome changes will not unduly crimp Facebook’s extraordinarily successful business model, and may even help Mark Zuckerberg overcome his corporate myopia that has exposed the company to preventable reputational risk in the past. Whether we “Like” it or not, we’re destined to live in the social media world we collectively helped Facebook build for many more years to come.","I am an Executive in Residence and Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, teaching courses in business strategy and corporate entrepreneurship.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Everyone rushed off.\"","Now, the Trump administration may roll back a rule that requires airlines to give passengers such as Hill theoption of getting off a flight that is delayed too long on an airport tarmac. And that's not the only regulation that might be weakened or scrapped.","Last year, the U.S. Department of Transportation temporarily froze all pending airline-industry regulations as part of an administration push to cut the burden of red tape on American businesses. And it asked the public and airlines for comments on existing regulations that could be halted, revised or repealed.","Among the rules airlines are targeting is the \"tarmac rule\" that requires carriers to let fliers off planes during extensive delays. Above, an American Airlines flight. (Jerome Adamstein / Los Angeles Times)","The so-called \"tarmac delay rule\" — adopted in 2009 after a series of incidents in which passengers were trapped in planes for hours — was just one of dozens that either airlines or an industry trade group targeted in response to the request.","The deregulation initiative is a dramatic shift for the federal agency, which under President Obama adopted or proposed more than 80 airline-related consumer-protection and safety regulations — prompting an outcry from the airline industry.","The agency also meted out stiff penalties. From 2015 to 2016, the transportation department increased the total amount of civil penalties on airlines and travel agents to $6.4 million from $2.4 million.","Southwest Airlines, for example, was fined $1.6 million for stranding passengers on 16 planes during storms on Jan. 1 and 2 in 2014 at Midway International Airport in Chicago. Some passengers were stuck on the tarmac for more than four hours.","\"The airlines are pretty clear that they want every consumer protection law repealed or not enforced,\" said Paul Hudson, president of Flyersrights.org, a nonprofit group with more than 60,000 members. \"I'm concerned that they would try to repeal the few consumer-protection regulations that are out there.\"","For its part, Airlines for America, a Washington, D.C.-based industry trade group, called the Transportation Department's initiative \"a much-welcomed shift from a decade's-long Washington practiceof regulatory interference in the market.\"","The group is specifically asking to modify or rescind more than 30 regulations, while individual airlines such as Delta, United and American either echoed those ideas or suggested rule changes of their own with the Transportation Department. All three airlines declined to comment on their filings.","Airlines want to end several rules. Among them is a requirement for carriers to advertise full fares, including taxes and fees for items such as baggage. Above, passengers at LAX in 2016. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)","Beyond the tarmac rule, other popular regulations that could be changed include one that requires airlines to advertise fares that include all fees and taxes. Another mandates that passengers be informed about how to file a service complaint with the department.","The deregulation push comes as the industry is basking in profit. Airlines reported a combined $17.6 billion in profit last year, a dramatic improvement from the nine years after the 9/11 terrorist strikes when the entire U.S. airline industry lost a combined $65 billion.","Advertisement","That improved financial performance resulted in an industry profit margin of more than 6% last year, compared with an average loss of 6.3% in the previous nine years, according to Airlines for America. Still, carriers say the regulations imposed by Washington are hurting their bottom lines.","\"Many of the regulations/initiatives adopted or issued at the end of the previous administration are extremely costly, will be unduly burdensome on the airline industry, and should be repealed or permanently terminated,\" United Airlines said in its statement filed with the Transportation Department.","For its part, the department said it will hold public hearings on the industry's requests if it determines it wants to alter an existing rule. The process could take months and, in the end, the airlines may not get all or many of the changes they want.","\"We are currently reviewing these comments carefully to determine what, if any, next steps to take,\" the department said in a statement.","Alison McAfee, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, said she understands that all or most of the recommendations for revisions or repeals won't be adopted. But she hopes that \"an open and honest dialogue\" with the department will lead to positive change.","Consumer groups worry, though, that the Transportation Department under President Trump will be more concerned with the financial well-being of the airline industry than the rights of passengers.","And it strikes them as audacious that the industry would seek to reduce its regulatory burden given its poor reputation. In 2017, airlines received a score of 75 out of 100 on the American Consumer Satisfaction Index. That is lower than U.S. banks (80), drugstores (79) and gas stations (76).","\"It appears the only voice that matters are the airlines and the big powerful concerns,\" said Kurt Ebenhoch, executive director of the Air Travel Fairness Coalition, an advocacy group that is pushing for full transparency of fares.","The 2012 rule that forces airline to advertise their full fares was in response to complaints from travelers who for years reserved tickets only to find that the final fare was as much as 30% higher when fees and taxes were included.","Now, when travelers search on airline websites, Expedia or other travel sites for a flight, they see the final price, with no hidden fees that cause sticker shock when it is time to pay the bill.","\"For travelers to make fair comparisons among different itineraries, we have to know what flights will cost, apples to apples, so to speak,\" said Steven Youra, a retired writing instructor from South Pasadena who flies about six times a year.","\"That means we need, first, to have easy access to the full fare, including taxes and fees. If the government does not require that full disclosure, it's just inviting the airlines to practice bait-and-switch,\" he said.","Advertisement","But in its filing to the Transportation Department, Delta Air Lines suggested that the full price \"distorts consumers' views of what they pay for airline service (as opposed to what they pay in government-imposed fees and taxes), causing consumer confusion and engendering negative views of airfares.\"","Another rule the industry is targeting is the 2011 regulation that gives passengers 24 hours after booking a flight the right to cancel and get a full refund. American Airlines told the department that it and other carriers already sell tickets with various options, including those that are nonrefundable and those that offer the right to cancel beyond 24 hours for a higher price.","Airlines for America, in its filing, said the rule allows passengers to hold \"an unlimited number of reservations at once, free of any cancellation penalty during the 24-hour hold period,\" thus eliminating a carrier's ability to sell those seats to another buyer.","Perhaps the highest-profile consumer rule adopted during the Obama administration was the \"tarmac rule.\" Under the 2009 law, airlines are required to provide water, food and access to bathrooms during long delays and must let passengers on domestic flights exit the plane if the delay on the tarmac lasts at least three hours. The rule extends to four hours for international flights.","Airlines can be fined as much as $27,500 for every passenger who is stranded. The rule was in response to several infamous cases of flight delays, including the plight in 2009 of passengers stranded for nearly six hours on a plane in Rochester, Minn.","United Airlines suggested that the Transportation Department ease its enforcement of the rule and \"increase efforts to work cooperatively with the industry.\" The airline proposed that airlines be fined for every flight that is delayed on a tarmac — not for every passenger who is affected — and that the federal agency not fine airlines if delays are due to employee rest requirements or shift changes.","Another rule airlines and their trade group have complained about is a requirement that airlines \"promptly\" provide wheelchair assistance to passengers with disabilities, saying the rule should not be enforced until the term \"promptly\" is clarified.","Airlines also want to eliminate a requirement that they inform passengers how to file complaints with the federal agency, with the trade group saying it \"displaces other information carriers wish to convey to their customers.\"","Among other paperwork Airlines for America wants to eliminate are the monthly filings about the loss, injury or death of animals on the plane.

The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25.","The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights.","European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,'' said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.''","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,'' allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.Siva Vaidhyanathan, Professor, University of Virginia","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,'' said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","The legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.'' The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover _ whichever is greater _ for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off'' European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds-barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,'' she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. ``We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,'' it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,'' he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,'' he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.''","Top investor, Ruchir Sharma believes Modi government's chances of re-election dropped from 99% last year to 50% now. Do you agree?","The regulator had issued a consultation paper in July proposing amendments in its securities regulations to expand the definition of market fiduciaries to cover Chartered Accountants (CAs), cost accountants, company secretaries, valuers and monitoring agencies.","Well regarded finance head at Sasken Technologies, Neeta Revankar, doubles up a whole time director on the Board too.

The revelation offers a glimpse into how 'big data' is eroding privacy and reshaping politics.","Dado Ruvic/Photo illustration/Reuters/File","A photo illustration depicts a Facebook logo mirrored in a human eye. The company's data on consumers has big value to corporations, and has also become sought-after by political campaigns seeking insights on how to sway voters.","In 2014, when Thom Tillis was a North Carolina legislator seeking election to the US Senate, some of his campaign ads were customized using what was then an unconventional technique.","Drawing on information volunteered by Facebook users who took online psychological quizzes, campaign consultants formed personality profiles of individual voters, and designed ads accordingly.","For people who scored high on being “agreeable,” an ad featured Mr. Tillis himself, smiling, with the message “restore common sense in Washington.” For personalities deemed “conscientious,” ads sent online and by mail featured people at a job site, including one in a hard hat, and said the Republican candidate had “the experience to get the economy working.” A third showed what appeared to be a soldier’s camouflage-smeared face, and said of Tillis: “Your safety is his top priority.”","That last one was aimed at those who score high on “neuroticism,” or negative emotions.","Tillis’s successful effort to sway voters, reported by the MIT Technology Review in April 2016, helped set the stage for more ambitious work by the data-crunching firm in the 2016 presidential race.","Now that firm, Cambridge Analytica, is the focus of controversy for its role in the 2016 Trump campaign, notably the way it relied on unauthorized access to personal Facebook data on some 50 million Americans. Cambridge Analytica has suspended its CEO, while Facebook, which has cut ties with the firm, now faces heightened scrutiny.","But beyond the legal questions surrounding the Facebook data is a deeper story: These efforts to mobilize some voters and dissuade others offer a glimpse of how the marketing of political candidates is growing ever more psychologically targeted. And where Cambridge Analytica’s CEO has touted the change as an inevitable computer-driven enhancement of communication, some experts say it carries risks for the health of democracy.","“We've never had a system of mass micro persuasion” until fairly recently, let alone deployed it to influence the political process, says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy in Washington. “Politics and life of our democracy is not the same as selling soap and fast foods.” Companies like Facebook, he says, “have clearly lost their moral compass in pursuit of astronomical revenues.”","It’s a debate that appears sure to grow, fueled in part by political parties’ long history of attempting to use data on individual voters to sway elections.","What’s new is the rising sophistication of the efforts – as the volume of data on individuals soars alongside the ability of software to sift and make use of that data. That doesn’t mean these data-crunching techniques were necessarily pivotal in either the Tillis race or the 2016 presidential election.","Calls for transparency","But to some analysts, including Mr. Chester, the increasing use of personalized data is troubling as it grows more advanced in seeking to influence voters – and does so in ways that voters may not understand. He suggests that America needs a federal law to protect online privacy, in effect seeking to level a playing field that’s now stacked toward corporate data-gathering. (Europe has such a law, which will go into effect in May.) And he suggests that companies need to do more to be transparent about their data handling and ramp up their own policies regarding its ethical use.","In a December report, co-written with Kathryn Montgomery of American University, Chester writes that some of the techniques “raise serious concerns – over privacy, discrimination, manipulation, and lack of transparency.”","In the case of Cambridge Analytica, the firm has claimed that its trove of data – such as Facebook users’ “likes” on particular websites or online posts – allows it to help campaigns target messages to individual voters.","The firm got hold of the Facebook data in a roundabout way, acquiring it from an academic researcher who, in turn, had gotten access to the data alongside responses to a personality-modeling questionnaire. In effect, when 270,000 people took the test, the process also opened up access to data on their millions of Facebook friends.","Facebook learned in 2015 of the unauthorized access by Cambridge Analytica, a spinoff of Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL. Facebook asked that the firm promise to delete the data, but it did not ensure that this occurred. Nor did Facebook notify the public of the breach of its policies. Although Facebook took some steps in 2014 to restrict access to its data via software apps, its business model continues to rely on revenue from firms (and others like political campaigns) that target ads using consumer data.","The exception or the rule?","In short, although Cambridge Analytica is catching fire for how it got Facebook data, many other firms get the same or similar data in ways that are perfectly legal.","Consider LiveRamp, a subsidiary of the data broker Acxiom, which promises clients: “Tie all of your marketing data back to real people, resolving identity across first-, second-, or third-party digital and offline data silos.”","In the marketing industry, many say this is simply the new normal of the digital era. Consumers know they’re trading in much of their privacy in return for getting to use websites like Facebook or other largely free digital tools, says Michael Priem, founder and CEO of ModernImpact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis. And they largely accept that consumer ads are being targeted at them based on that data, just as they accept that when they walk into a retail store, there’s a surveillance camera watching them.","“That's not scary,” he says. “What's scary is when consumers don't know: ‘Am I being watched?’ ”","Companies have self-interested reasons to develop standards that are acceptable to consumers, Mr. Priem says. But some consumer advocates say the industry needs more regulation alongside such self-developed standards.","Privacy groups have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether, due to the Cambridge Analytica data use, Facebook violated an FTC consent order regarding data privacy on the social network. There are calls for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. The company is denying reports its chief of data security is resigning. On Wednesday Mr. Zuckerberg said the company is taking steps to audit for suspicious activity apps that access its data. And he said developers of software (like the personality-quiz app) would see their data access restricted further.","Possible sea change","The flurry of concerns suggests this has the potential to become a turning point in public thought on a long-simmering issue.","It’s not new, after all, for political campaigns to blend social-media savvy into their strategies.","“In 2012, both the Romney and Obama campaigns used Facebook apps to pull data about people,” notes Shannon McGregor, a communications professor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who studies social media and politics. In 2016, her research showed that virtually every presidential campaign used social media to gain insights into voters.","Also, the latest revelations come alongside a year’s worth of evidence that Russia has used digital tactics to meddle in US and other recent elections.","Nor is it clear that the new data methods are actually very effective at swaying voters.","While Cambridge Analytica has touted its successes – such as in helping Sen. Ted Cruz (R) of Texas gain traction in the Iowa caucuses as a challenger to Trump before the firm was engaged by the Trump campaign – “we have really good reason to be skeptical that anything that Cambridge Analytica engaged in was necessarily more effective than other standard forms of voter targeting and strategic appeals,” says Daniel Kreiss, a communications expert at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.","Still, he says there’s a “stunning” lack of transparency and accountability at companies including Facebook and Google over how their data are being used in politics.","Few guidelines","Among the ethical gray areas: As political communication becomes more customized, does that amplify the polarization of the electorate?","Professor Kreiss says Facebook’s business model “makes it really easy to speak to people who are aligned with your camp” on any particular issue. And the prevalent clickbait model online communication encourages “content that engages people in emotional ways.”","Follow Stories Like This","Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.","Regulators haven’t kept pace with the innovations around political use of social media, whether regarding access to the data or the kind of messaging carried by it. “There is very little regulation around this type of advertising, which accounts for billions and billions of dollars of advertising,” Professor McGregor says.","What’s needed is a change in mindset, says McGregor. “For these companies, it’s clear that they can make a lot of money from accepting political ads and being able to target in this case voters in specific ways.” But, she says, “the implications are much more far-reaching in terms of the integrity of our elections.”","Share this article","Link copied.","Next up","Here are more stories that look at the news with empathy, insight, and hope."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn’t give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook’s mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past.","Facebook denied the claim, writing in a blog post: “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case.”","Facebook explained that users must opt in to share their mobile meta data.","It wrote:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","However, Ars Technica questioned whether a service was really “opt in” if the opt-in was a default setting:","While data collection was technically “opt-in,” in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook’s application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook data.","This latest spat over privacy protection comes as Facebook has launched a major effort to rebuild trust amid the unfolding Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a third-party organization obtained millions of users’ data without their permission.","Facebook’s public statement, posted on its press site, comes a couple of days after it took out full page newspaper ads to apologize for the misuse of data by third-party apps as it copes with fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal (follow the story as it develops here). In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.”","Some are demanding another apology—and a better explanation—from the social media company.","This time, the company has issued a statement saying it did nothing wrong. For one thing, it emphasizes that while it may be storing data about every phone call and text, including who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was, it did not actually record the content of those conversations and texts. (Is that supposed to make us feel like our privacy has been respected? Apparently Facebook thinks it should.)","Contact importers might be common, but tracking and storing data about every call or text users make and receive is pretty uncommon, or at least I hope it is. Facebook appears to be deliberately ignoring the fact that there’s a huge difference between these two things.","Local news helps people connect to their communities about the issues that are closest to home. Earlier this year, we announced a change in the US to prioritize local news so people can see topics that have a direct impact on their community and discover what’s happening in their local area.","Today, we’re expanding that update to people in all countries, in all languages. Now, people around the world will see more news on Facebook from local sources covering their current city and other cities they may care about.","However, the scandal seems unlikely to fade as users express their shock about the sorts of data they found in their Facebook downloads.","I’ve just looked at the data files I requested from Facebook and they had every single phone number in my contacts. They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text I’ve sent.","They have plundered my phone.

As a chorus of calls mounts for answers about its data practices, Facebook is looking to hire at least 11 people for policy-related positions in Washington, according to its website. The company started hiring new lobbyists last fall after revelations Russians exploited its platform to help elect President Donald Trump.","On Monday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley became the latest lawmaker to call for Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of confirming it’s investigating Facebook’s privacy policies following revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s use of its data. The National Association of Attorneys General also wants to hear from Zuckerberg.","The calls for Zuckerberg to testify in Washington grew louder after a series of briefings by lower company executives last week left senior lawmakers dissatisfied. Commerce Chairman John Thune, Mark Warner, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also called on Zuckerberg to appear.","Zuckerberg Invitation","Zuckerberg last week suggested he’d be willing to come and answer questions if he determines he is the right person to appear. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, sent an invitation Monday asking Zuckerberg to answer questions at an April 10 hearing. He also invited Google Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey to appear before his panel to discuss data privacy.","Facebook hasn’t answered Grassley yet. But the company is struggling to stave off a barrage of criticism that it hasn’t done enough to address revelations that Cambridge Analytica, which worked with Trump’s campaign, siphoned data from some 50 million Facebook users as it built an election-consulting company that boasted it could sway voters in contests all over the world.","Facebook has lost about $73 billion in market value in the past six trading days. Since March 16, the stock has fallen 14 percent and is on track for its worst month in four years. The shares rebounded from earlier losses to end up 0.4 percent at $160.06 Monday.","Last week, Facebook officials appeared unprepared and uncertain during briefings with congressional staff to answer questions about how big the problem is, according to staffers who attended the meetings.","Multiple Briefings","Company executives told the aides in multiple briefings that they didn’t know how many copies of user data similar to that obtained by Cambridge Analytica have been made, how widely disseminated those duplicates might be and who has that information, said the staffers, who asked not to be identified because the briefings weren’t public.","The key issue raised in the briefings was whether there might be others that had access to the data that Cambridge Analytica obtained beginning in 2014 after entering into a commercial venture with a firm called Global Science Research, which initially got a smaller amount of user data under the guise of academic research.","Zuckerberg echoed in a round of interviews last week that the company was looking into the scope of the problem and didn’t yet know what it would find. He added that Facebook has a responsibility to make sure it can secure the data.","Tracking System","In the briefings, the Facebook officials acknowledged the company doesn’t have a system to track whether a user that had promised to delete profile information had actually duplicated it and said there’s no follow-up procedure or enforcement mechanism to lock down the data.","Congressional staffers came away from the briefings doubting that the company could provide a full accounting of who might have access to the data. Facebook wouldn’t disclose the names of the company officials that carried out the briefings, which were with staffers of the House Energy and Commerce, the Judiciary and Intelligence committee, and the Senate Commerce committee.","Staffers also asked the Facebook officials questions about who owns data on the social network and about the policies, procedures and terms of service now in effect and what Facebook will do next.","Policy Hires","Among the hires Facebook is seeking to make are privacy and public policy managers, a government outreach manager, associate general counsel positions, and a couple of policy managers to help draft positions on tech and video policy issues. Some of the postings say the positions could be based in either Washington or the company’s Menlo Park, California headquarters. It wasn’t clear when the jobs were posted or whether they are new positions. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the policy positions the company is currently trying to fill.","The company ranks third among top tech companies in Washington lobbying spending after Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc. and employs about 40 internal and external lobbyists. The company disclosed spending $11.5 million on lobbying in 2017, up from $8.7 million the year before.","In the days last fall before Facebook officials were called in to testify on the Russian campaign meddling, the company hired three lobbyists to work on issues that included online advertising and election integrity, according to federal disclosures.","Three Lobbyists","The three lobbyists were David Wade, a former top aide to John Kerry during his tenures in the Senate and at the State Department; Sudafi Henry, who served as Vice President Joe Biden’s legislative affairs director; and Luke Albee, a former chief of staff to Senator Mark Warner. They all started lobbying for Facebook in October, according to congressional filings.","It wasn’t clear if any of them participated in the congressional briefings last week.","Albee started lobbying for the company on Oct. 30 — two days before his former boss, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, grilled Colin Stretch, the company’s general counsel, in a hearing.

What didn’t she see? - The Washington Post","text":["Clinton’s data-driven campaign relied heavily on an algorithm named Ada. What didn’t she see?","Hillary Clinton at a rally in Raleigh, N.C., on the eve of the election. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)","Inside Hillary Clinton's campaign, she was known as Ada. Like the candidate herself, she had a penchant for secrecy and a private server. As blame gets parceled out Wednesday for the Democrat's stunning loss to Republican President-elect Donald Trump, Ada is likely to get a lot of second-guessing.","Ada is a complex computer algorithm that the campaign was prepared to publicly unveil after the election as its invisible guiding hand. Named for a female 19th-century mathematician — Ada, Countess of Lovelace — the algorithm was said to play a role in virtually every strategic decision Clinton aides made, including where and when to deploy the candidate and her battalion of surrogates and where to air television ads — as well as when it was safe to stay dark.","The campaign's deployment of other resources — including county-level campaign offices and the staging of high-profile concerts with stars like Jay Z and Beyoncé — was largely dependent on Ada's work, as well.","While the Clinton campaign's reliance on analytics became well known, the particulars of Ada's work were kept under tight wraps, according to aides. The algorithm operated on a separate computer server than the rest of the Clinton operation as a security precaution, and only a few senior aides were able to access it.","According to aides, a raft of polling numbers, public and private, were fed into the algorithm, as well as ground-level voter data meticulously collected by the campaign. Once early voting began, those numbers were factored in, too.","What Ada did, based on all that data, aides said, was run 400,000 simulations a day of what the race against Trump might look like. A report that was spit out would give campaign manager Robby Mook and others a detailed picture of which battleground states were most likely to tip the race in one direction or another — and guide decisions about where to spend time and deploy resources.","The use of analytics by campaigns was hardly unprecedented. But Clinton aides were convinced their work, which was far more sophisticated than anything employed by President Obama or GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, gave them a big strategic advantage over Trump.","So where did Ada go wrong?","About some things, she was apparently right. Aides say Pennsylvania was pegged as an extremely important state early on, which explains why Clinton was such a frequent visitor and chose to hold her penultimate rally in Philadelphia on Monday night.","But it appears that the importance of other states Clinton would lose — including Michigan and Wisconsin — never became fully apparent or that it was too late once it did.","President Obama brought his tried-and-true campaign slogans and humor-filled attacks on Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton's defense in the final days of the presidential campaign. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)","Clinton made several visits to Michigan during the general election, but it wasn't until the final days that she, Obama and her husband made such a concerted effort.","As for Wisconsin: Clinton didn't make any appearances there at all.","Like much of the political establishment Ada appeared to underestimate the power of rural voters in Rust Belt states.","Clearly, there were things neither she nor a human could foresee — like a pair of bombshell letters sent by the FBI about Clinton's email server. But in coming days and weeks, expect a debate on how heavily campaigns should rely on data, particularly in a year like this one in which so many conventional rules of politics were cast aside."],"isopubdate":"2018-09-18"}

But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.","[Update, March 25, 2018, 20:24 Eastern Time]: Facebook has responded to this and other reports regarding the collection of call and SMS data with a blog post that denies Facebook collected call data surreptitiously. The company also writes that it never sells the data and that users are in control of the data uploaded to Facebook. This \"fact check\" contradicts several details Ars found in analysis of Facebook data downloads and testimony from users who provided the data. More on the Facebook response is appended to the end of the original article below.","This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years' worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.","This experience has been shared by a number of other Facebook users who spoke with Ars, as well as independently by us—my own Facebook data archive, I found, contained call-log data for a certain Android device I used in 2015 and 2016, along with SMS and MMS message metadata.","In response to an email inquiry by Ars about this data gathering, a Facebook spokesperson replied, \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","The spokesperson pointed out that contact uploading is optional and installation of the application explicitly requests permission to access contacts. And users can delete contact data from their profiles using a tool accessible via Web browser.","Further Reading","Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past. (For Facebook's instructions on turning off continuous contact uploading, go here. )","If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. From Android 4.1 on, a single request from those applications would trigger two separate permission requests.","But until the \"Marshmallow\" version of Android, even with split permissions, all permissions could still be presented all at once, without users getting the option to decline them individually. So Facebook and other applications could continue to gain access to call and SMS data with a single request by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Starting with Marshmallow, users could toggle these permissions separately themselves. But as many as half of Android users worldwide remain on older versions of the operating system because of carrier restrictions on updates or other issues.","Apple iOS has never allowed access to call log data by third-party apps, overt or silently, so this sort of data acquisition was never possible.","Facebook provides a way for users to purge collected contact data from their accounts, but it's not clear if this deletes just contacts or if it also purges call and SMS metadata. After purging my contact data, my contacts and calls were still in the archive I downloaded the next day—likely because the archive was not regenerated for my new request. (Update: The cached archive was generated once and not updated on the second request. However, two days after a request to delete all contact data, the contacts were still listed by the contact management tool.)","As always, if you're really concerned about privacy, you should not share address book and call-log data with any mobile application. And you may want to examine the rest of what can be found in the downloadable Facebook archive, as it includes all the advertisers that Facebook has shared your contact information with, among other things.","Update, March 25, 2018, continued:","Facebook responded to reports that it collected phone and SMS data without users' knowledge in a \"fact check\" blog post on Sunday. In the response, a Facebook spokesperson stated:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","This contradicts the experience of several users who shared their data with Ars. Dylan McKay told Ars that he installed Messenger in 2015, but only allowed the app the permissions in the Android manifest that were required for installation. He says he removed and reinistalled the app several times over the course of the next few years, but never explicitly gave the app permission to read his SMS records and call history. McKay's call and SMS data runs through July of 2017.","In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used. Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.","While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data.","Facebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \"help friends find each other\" after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \"opt-in\" for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \"OK\" button to approve \"keeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\"","Facebook says that the company keeps the data secure and does not sell it to third parties. But the post doesn't address why it would be necessary to retain not just the numbers of contacts from phone calls and SMS messages, but the date, time, and length of those calls for years."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

The social network said the company failed to delete data that it had taken inappropriately from users of the social media network.","Facebook said late Friday (March 16) it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. It also suspended the accounts of a University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Cambridge Analytica, a firm specializing in using online data to create voter personality profiles to target them with political messages, ran data operations for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and former Trump senior adviser Stephen Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","In response to the suspension, the London-based Cambridge said: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook's terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook ... in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of the investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his mobile device application.

Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge and to Wylie.","Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015. It removed Kogan's app and demanded certifications from Kogan, Cambridge and Wylie that the information he had shared had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to Facebook that they had done so.","But Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" the company said. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.

This is according to statements by a young Mark Zuckerberg anyway. Back in 2004, when a 19-year-old Zuckerberg had just started building Facebook, he sent his Harvard friends a series of instant messages in which he marvelled at the fact that 4,000 people had volunteered their personal information to his nascent social network. “People just submitted it ... I don’t know why ... They ‘trust me’ ... dumb fucks.”","Are you leaving Facebook? Share your concerns on privacy with us","Read more","Fourteen years later, the number of people who have trusted Zuckerberg with their data has grown from 4,000 to 2 billion. Zuckerberg has also grown, or so he would have you believe. In a 2010 interview with the New Yorker, the Facebook founder said he regretted those early messages. “If you’re going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? I think I’ve grown and learned a lot.”","When it comes to respecting and safeguarding the information people have given him, however, has Zuckerberg really learned that much? Recent events suggest not.","On Saturday, the Observer revealed how Cambridge Analytica, a company funded by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, acquired and exploited the data associated with 50m Facebook profiles. It appears that while Facebook had been aware of what the Observer described as “unprecedented data harvesting” for two years, it did not notify the affected users.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","What’s more, Facebook has displayed a remarkable lack of contrition in the immediate aftermath of the Observer’s revelations. Instead of accepting responsibility, its top executives argued on Twitter that the social network had done nothing wrong. “This was unequivocally not a data breach,” Facebook vice-president Andrew Bosworth tweeted on Saturday. “People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","In a sense, Facebook’s defence to the Cambridge Analytica story was more damning than the story itself. Tracy Chou, a software engineer who has interned at Facebook and worked at a number of prominent Silicon Valley companies, agrees that there wasn’t a hack or breach of Facebook’s security. Rather, she explains, “this is the way that Facebook works”. The company’s business model is to collect, share and exploit as much user data as possible; all without informed consent. Cambridge Analytica may have violated Facebook’s terms of service, but Facebook had no safeguards in place to stop them.","While some Facebook executives were busy defending their honour on Twitter over the weekend, it should be noted that Zuckerberg remained deafeningly silent. On Monday, Facebook’s shares dropped almost 7%, taking $36bn (£25.7bn) off the company’s valuation. Still, Zuckerberg remained silent. If you’re going to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? Apparently, silence is Zuck’s way of being mature.","But forget how the folks at Facebook are reacting to this – still unfolding – PR crisis. If you’re one of the social network’s 2 billion users, how are you reacting? Have you deleted your account in protest? Are you angrily sharing articles about the fiasco on Facebook but continuing to use the service? Have you shrugged and moved on?","For my part, the Cambridge Analytica story was the nudge I needed to finally cut ties with the social network. I’ve been trying to extricate myself from Facebook for a long time. My uneasiness with the network largely stems from the fact that I used to work in advertising and, for years, was on the receiving end of many a sales pitch from Facebook, Google and other companies that have built businesses trading in users’ data.","Funnily enough, the likes of Facebook deliver a very different narrative to marketers than they do the wider public. They downplay their significance when challenged by the media about, for example, their influence on the 2016 US election. They downplay their power to deal with online harassment or the spread of fake news. However, if you’ve got an advertising budget and want to know how Facebook can persuade your target consumer to buy your product, it’s a different story. Suddenly, Facebook is an all-knowing entity with unrivalled information; it can get almost anyone to do almost anything. While Facebook presents itself to the public as a social network, when addressing the advertising industry, it is very clear about the fact that it’s a surveillance system.","Learning just how much Facebook knew about its users put me off using the network. But while I stopped actively using Facebook and its suite of apps, including Messenger and Instagram, years ago, it’s only recently that I decided to delete my account. Before taking the plunge, however, I downloaded an archive of all the data I had put on Facebook. There’s an option to do this when you go to Facebook’s settings. It’s easy and I highly recommend it. Seeing years’ worth of data neatly arranged serves as an important wakeup call as to the extent of the information you have handed over to the company. Even then I was loath to get rid of my account altogether; just in case I needed to contact someone or check something. But on Monday, having witnessed Facebook’s refusal to take any meaningful responsibility in regards to the Cambridge Analytica story, I deleted my account in disgust.","To be clear: I’m not recommending that you do the same. In many ways, being able to distance yourself from Facebook these days is a privilege. As Safiya Noble, an assistant professor of information studies at the University of Southern California and the author of Algorithms of Oppression, notes: “For many people, Facebook is an important gateway to the internet. In fact, it is the only version of the internet that some know, and it plays a central role in communicating, creating community and participating in society online.”","Even if you’ve got multiple ways to communicate and participate in society online, there is not really a good replacement for Facebook. There’s no one portal that reminds you of your friends’ birthdays, connects you to relatives across the world and stores photos from 10 years ago. Deleting Facebook inevitably means missing out on certain things and having to make more of an effort to connect with people in other ways.","What’s more, unless you delete Facebook’s entire ecosystem of apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, you aren’t safeguarding yourself from the company’s data-collection practices. I haven’t brought myself to delete WhatsApp, for example, because I still think that the benefits of using that outweigh the privacy tradeoffs. Nor have I fully deleted Instagram, which is just as nefarious as Facebook. Deleting my Facebook account may have some way to protecting my sanity, but it has done little to minimise my digital footprint.","As Noble stresses, “deleting individual Facebook accounts will not solve the total datafication of our lives”. While deleting your account may give you some temporary satisfaction, it has “little impact on finding real solutions to the way data is being collected, sold, and used against the public. This issue isn’t just about one platform like Facebook, and the issues of surveillance and experimentation on the public, it’s about the many companies that are tracking and profiling us, and the abuses of power that come from having vast troves of information about us, available for exploitation.”","Other data experts echo Noble’s view. As Frederike Kaltheuner, who leads the data exploitation programme at the charity Privacy International, explains: “You can delete your Facebook, but you will still be tracked in your online and increasingly also your offline life. Mobile phones are by definition a tracking device.”","The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how our data is being used and abused. This can not be stressed enough. The internet is increasingly a worldwide web of corporate surveillance and it’s impossible to piece together a complete picture of how your personal information – both your online and offline data – is being utilised. While behemoths such as Facebook are guaranteed to make headlines, there’s a lot less media scrutiny of the thousands of other companies that make a living out of extracting and exploiting your personal life in extremely dubious ways.","The software company Pixoneye, for example, is far from a household name. But if you have granted an app permission to access your photos in the past, there’s a good chance you have allowed it to utilise Pixoneye’s tech. This scans the photos on your phone and uses the data it extracts to create a story of who you are. It might characterise you as someone who watches sports, for example, or as wine-drinker who enjoys lots of family holidays. Your photo gallery offers a staggering amount of insight: as the CEO of Pixoneye wrote in an op-ed last year: “Our smartphone image galleries have in many ways become a reflection of our lives … each image you have stored contains a range of data attributes and meta tags that not only reveal your past purchasing profile, but can also be the key to predicting what purchases you’re likely to make in the future.”","So, you might be thinking, an app knows I like wine, and uses that information to sell me stuff. What’s the big deal? In isolation, not much. But, as Kaltheuner stresses, “when combined, data can reveal a lot”. Bringing together multiple data sources is “how data-brokers have information such as personality profiles and relationship statuses”. The more data points you have, the more you can predict. As the Cambridge Analytica investigation revealed, even a few dozen Facebook “likes” can strongly predict someone’s sexual orientation, or the political party they are most likely to vote for.","If you’re starting to feel jittery about the exploitation of your personal data but aren’t ready to delete social media and go and live off the grid, there are some simple steps you can take to mitigate your digital footprint. “We should all do a little digital spring cleaning,” advises Leila Hassan, head of analytics at the London branch of Ogilvy, a global advertising agency. “Check what [third-party apps] you’ve enabled through your social channels. I’ll bet most of us still have things enabled from years ago.”","In order to examine the apps you have enabled through Facebook, go to settings and click “Apps” on the left sidebar. When I did that I was somewhat alarmed to find that I had given 68 apps indefinite access to my Facebook data. Even more alarmingly, accounts I had deleted ages ago – such as the dating app Bumble – still seemed to have access to my Facebook information.","Once on this page, it’s easy to revoke permission for particular apps to access your data. It’s much harder, however, to view or remove the data they have already collected. Facebook informs you that you should “contact the developer of the app” if you want to get rid of the data they have collected. I didn’t really feel like contacting the developer of 68 different apps before deleting my Facebook account so I am unclear about the fate of the data they have amassed. Presumably it’s all floating around in the cloud somewhere.","Delete your account – a guide to life after Facebook","Read more","What else can you do to try and minimise your digital data trail? Jim Killock, from Open Rights Group, an organisation that works to protect the right to privacy online, suggests “posting less, sharing less and, most importantly, removing page ‘likes’ as these are a major way [Facebook tries] to profile you”. Killock further suggests using “privacy plug-ins to block Facebook cookies, and cookies from other websites, which they all use to keep a record of the sites you visit, and making extra, ‘fake’ accounts”. But Killock stresses that while it’s important that people are more cognisant of their online behaviour, “regulators must also act”. So must companies. “At Privacy International, we want companies to do better and protect privacy by default, rather than users having to become full-time data protection experts in order to have their basic rights protected,” says Kaltheuner.","Kaltheuner notes that a key point of the new legislation is that it is extraterritorial. “This means that if you are a company based outside the EU (for example in the US), and are offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the EU, you must comply with it. This is especially important in countries, such as the US, with no comprehensive data protection regime.”","While the GDPR is an important step towards giving people control over their data, it’s far from a cure-all. It is no exaggeration to say we are teetering on the edge of a data dystopia. Just look at China, where the government recently announced that it will ban people with poor “social credit” from travelling on planes and trains. And it’s not just China where oblique algorithms are determining the direction of our lives. The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are an important wakeup call that we are all living with the sociopolitical consequences of surveillance capitalism. We can’t just sit back and hope that regulation will save us. We can’t just click and like and share as usual and hope something will eventually change. We are, I think, at a critical moment where the degree of corporate surveillance to which we are all subjected can either get much better, or much worse. So, I would urge you to extricate yourself from social media as much as you can. Deleting your Facebook account may not put an end to the surveillance state, but it sends an important message to big tech that we don’t trust them any longer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Cadwalladr said Facebook threatened to sue in a bid to prevent The Guardian publishing an exposé on the data harvesting. She believes Facebook didn't inform users of the misuse of data because it wasn't in the company's best interest. The Guardian story, based on interviews with whistleblower Chris Wylie who worked for the firm, published online on Saturday.","\"This continual pattern that we've seen with Facebook -- trying to shut the story down, finally when it has no choice, acknowledge it. They've just really got to do better,\" she said.","\"What we desperately need is for Facebook to finally open up and be as honest and transparent as it can be about the way that their platform was used and manipulated during the U.S. presidential elections, during Brexit in the U.K.,\" Cadwalladr said, adding that Facebook continually tried to prevent her story from being published.","In a statement released late on Friday, Facebook acknowledged that it learned it had been \"lied to\" about Cambridge Analytica and an affiliate's activities in 2015, more than two years before suspending the firm from its platform, but did not alert users at the time. Facebook insisted there was no breach of their system.","After speaking with the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office, which promotes the protection of private information, Cadwalladr said it is clear \"this is a data breach.\"","\"Facebook has just turned around and blamed a third party,\" Cadwalladr said. \"We are clear this is a data breach, and Facebook's denials in the face of it -- their claim that it's not a data breach because nobody hacked into their system -- well, failing to secure your own data, failing to see how it's being used ... that falls within the definition of a data breach. Accept it, Facebook. Own it.\"","\"In a way it's even more damning that [Cambridge Analytica] got all of this data from Facebook without it being a breach,\" Wired editor-in-chief and CBS News contributor Nick Thompson said on CBSN.","\"It didn't work because somebody hacked in and broke stuff,\" Thompson added. \"It worked because Facebook has built the craziest most invasive advertising model in the history of the world and someone took advantage of it.\"","Since it was a violation of Facebook's terms of services, Thompson said he's not sure what government agency would be tasked with regulating the platform to prevent a recurrence in the political sphere.","\"I'm not sure, though, that you can actually regulate your way out of this problem because on the flip side of this, the reason political advertising on Facebook is so effective is because Facebook is a great tool for advertising,\" he said. \"You can't just shut down all advertising on Facebook or make it harder for people to micro-target on Facebook because in general that's just the way business works and they invented this great tool.\"","Cadwalladr said Facebook would have needed to inform 58 million people that their personal information was taken and \"essentially, there's no way of getting it back.\"","\"Once it's taken, it's out in the world, it can be copied, it can be stored elsewhere -- we just don't know what's happened to that data,\" Cadwalladr said Saturday.

It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable — say, by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed, or reminding you of friends’ birthdays.","Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that’s relatively clear and concise. But few users bother to read it. You might be surprised at what Facebook’s privacy policy allows — and what’s left unsaid.","Facebook’s privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users.

Sekulow had announced diGenova’s appointment last week.","Sunday’s announcement came just hours after Trump used Twitter to push back against reports that he’s having difficulty adding to his legal team, saying he was “very happy” with his current attorneys.","“Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case,” he wrote, adding: “Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted.”","37 dead, 69 missing in Russian shopping center fire","MOSCOW — A devastating fire at a shopping center in a Siberian city killed 37 people and left 69 others missing Sunday, many of them children, a Russian state news agency reported.","The Tass agency quoted firefighters as saying that 40 of the missing at the four-story Winter Cherry mall in Kemerovo were children. An additional 43 people were injured in the blaze, the report said.","There has been no immediate information on the cause of the fire at the mall, which is about 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles) east of Moscow.

With the press of two fingers, Delta members will be able to enter any of Delta’s 50 exclusive lounges for drinks, comfortably unaware of the encroaching dystopian biometric surveillance structure closing around travel.","Thanks to a partnership with Clear, a biometrics company offering a “frictionless travel experience,” privileged jet-setters can use their fingerprints to enter Delta Sky Clubs. The Sky Club, as one might imagine, is Delta’s line of airport lounges loaded with drinks, magazines, wi-fi, and snacks. Entry to the Sky Club is $59 a visit or $495 a year—a small price to pay for a respite from the unwashed masses. The fingerprint scans, however, are completely free.","Advertisement","Scanning the fingerprints of airport loungers isn’t Clear’s only endeavor. For an annual fee of $180, Clear members are spirited away from lengthy security lines and pat-downs and instead verify their identity in self-serve kiosks that match their irises and fingerprints against stored biometric data Clear keeps on file.","As Delta’s press release notes, biometrics are surging in airports across the globe. Travelers hate long lines, invasive scanning, and crowded waiting areas, so Clear, Delta, and other airports have packaged biometric scanning as luxuriant, exclusive, and above all else, extremely convenient. Anyone would be seduced by the opportunity to turn the hours long slog of airport security into something breezy and painless.","Advertisement","But, this veneer of comfort masks that biometrics are a form of surveillance hotly contested by privacy and civil liberties experts.

It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma.","A few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds.","Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window.","Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach","Read more","But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments.","When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality.","The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default.","“The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said.","“Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.”","To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.","The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well.","The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable.","Aleksandr Kogan","To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters.","It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use.","And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred.","It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another.","The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database.","Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed.","Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”.","Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach.","It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The data inside was not particularly usable for a Facebook user, except on Facebook.","But with all the controversy surrounding Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data of 50 million user profiles was misused, many users are reexamining their own relationship with the platform and the data it has.","It takes a few minutes for Facebook to prepare your archive into a .zip file to download, and once it’s unzipped, you can view it by double-clicking on the file “index.htm.” (The interface is web-based and will open in a browser.)","What your archive says","Your digital life, compressed into an archive, may be bizarre to see. Your relationships, should you have made them public are front and center in your details. Your email addresses, the names you used on Facebook (I used a fake name until 2014), your workplaces (one of mine just says “yes yes hi hello”), and all the things you “liked.”","Over the years, Facebook had different ways to deal with that stuff, so everything doesn’t quite match up perfectly. There used to be a place for favorite movies and books, and most of that merged to a general “Other” category. (Except for the movies category, which for me still displays “Roadhouse.”)","Among the items in the file are your entire timeline, which includes posts from previous iterations of Facebook, when posting on people’s walls, which comprised the bulk of a user’s interactions on the platform. (Perhaps it was not even a platform yet.)","Everything you and others posted is there, including all the things people wrote, assuming they were simply shouting into the abyss, figuring no one was listening. Facebook was, and they wrote it down!","Also present are the ad topics Facebook thinks you’d be into, the ads you’ve actually clicked on — this doesn’t seem complete, it says I clicked on only a few in just 2018 — and the advertisers that possess your data. Some of them are really weird: A friend texted me to say that “Rod Stewart” is listed under the advertisers that have his data. My editor’s archive showed that a bunch of cruise lines — and the musician Beck – had her data. (She has no idea why, and when asked whether she even likes Beck said, “I don’t know?”)","Most unnerving perhaps, are the private messages, compiled in one place. We get new phones or clear our old phone texts, but Facebook doesn’t have storage issues. It’s all here.","All of this should not be news to you. Facebook’s 3 billion users give this information willingly, and we certainly expect the company not to delete old posts. But the archive, compiled for the benefit of the user, puts the concept into alarming relief, showing exactly how much of our lives we’ve poured into it. And of course, how easy it is to condense a digital life into a .zip file.","It’s scary, but it’s not a surprise","When you post a photo on Facebook, you expect it to be available — even years later. Recently, Facebook even made a feature on this, showing friend retrospectives for friend anniversaries in your newsfeed. Similarly, the motivation for the collection of some of this data – advertising – was detailed in the fine print. Unfortunately, most don’t read the fine print and thus miss this devil in the details. (Though the fact that a 13-year-old is expected to read and understand this may trouble some.)","How Facebook can interpret all this data may be of more interest. You can see what their conclusions are if you read this article. From the data you provide as a user, what you “like” on the platform, they can get a decent picture of who you are.","Another friend and Facebook user I talked with noted that it was interesting that people seem more concerned with “psychographic data” rather than the fact that Equifax exposed 150 million Social Security numbers, something that has identity theft and financial security implications. The answer, of course, is because there’s a small-ish .zip file —mine was 34 megabytes filled with secrets. If it got loose, it would be pure KOMPROMAT. (Update your password.)","From a personal data hygiene perspective, if all this doesn’t sit well with you, the only thing you can really do is delete the contacts you may have uploaded to Facebook. Though you can make things hidden, purging the site of your data seems to mean full-scale account deletion, if you want to set fire to your old activity."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","Originally published on March 16, 2018:We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.","We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies","Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","How Things Have Changed","We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.","In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time.","On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps.","We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation."],"isopubdate":""}

The head of the committee, Damian Collins, urged Zuckerberg to reconsider, saying, “It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process.”","“The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago,” Zuckerberg said, referring to changes made to Facebook’s developer platform policies in 2014 that saw devs banned from gathering data about the friends of people using their apps – which is how CA was able to harvest so much information from the social networking site by directly interacting with only 300,000 people."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Readers with long memories will recall him as the guy who ran the “White House Plumbers” during the presidency of Richard Nixon. Liddy directed the Watergate burglary in June 1972, detection of which started the long chain of events that eventually led to Nixon’s resignation two years later. For his pains, Liddy spent more than four years in jail, but went on to build a second career as a talk-show host and D-list celebrity. Reflecting on this, one wonders what job opportunities – other than those of pantomime villain and Savile Row mannequin – will now be available to Mr Nix.","The investigations into the company by Carole Cadwalladr, in the Observer, reveal that in every respect save one important one, CA looks like a standard-issue psychological warfare outfit of the kind retained by political parties – and sometimes national security services – since time immemorial. It did, however, have one unique selling proposition, namely its ability to offer “psychographic” services: voter-targeting strategies allegedly derived by analysing the personal data of more than 50 million US users of Facebook.","The story of how those data made the journey from Facebook’s servers to Cambridge Analytica’s is now widely known. But it is also widely misunderstood. (Many people were puzzled, for example, by Facebook’s vehement insistence that the exfiltration of a huge trove of users’ data was not a “breach”.) The shorthand version of what happened – that “a slug of Facebook data on 50 million Americans was sucked down by a UK academic named Aleksandr Kogan, and wrongly sold to Cambridge Analytica” – misses an important point, which is that in acquiring the data in the first place Kogan was acting with Facebook’s full knowledge and approval.","In 2013, he wrote an app called “Thisisyourdigitallife” which offered users an online personality test, describing itself as “a research app used by psychologists”. Approximately 270,000 people downloaded it and in doing so gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it. This drew more than 50 million unsuspecting Facebook users into Kogan’s net.","Profile","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica","Nix worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman.","Controversies","Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison","Photograph: The Washington Post","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The key point is that all of this was allowed by the terms and conditions under which he was operating. Thousands of other Facebook apps were also operating under similar T&Cs – and had been since 2007, when the company turned its social networking service into an application platform.","So Kogan was only a bit player in the data-hoovering game: apps such as the insanely popular Candy Crush, for example, were also able to collect players’ public profiles, friends lists and email addresses. And Facebook seemed blissfully indifferent to this open door because it was central to its commercial strategy: the more apps there were on its platform the more powerful the network effects would be and the more personal data there would be to monetise.","That’s why the bigger story behind the current controversy is the fact that what Cambridge Analytica claimed to have accomplished would not have been possible without Facebook. Which means that, in the end, Facebook poses the problem that democracies will have to solve.","In that context, the firm’s response to the crisis has been instructive. The first stage was denial: there was no “data breach”; then there were legal threats and the heavy artillery of expensive law firms; after that we were treated to ludicrous attempts to portray a giant global corporation as an innocent victim of wicked people who did terrible things behind its back.","And then, finally – after an extended bout of corporate panic at its Californian HQ as the share price tanked – there was a return to euphemistic form as the boy wonder CEO came out from under the duvet wearing his signature grey T-shirt. He was in his sorrowful-but-resolute mode: “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” he wrote. “But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that. In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way. But there’s more we need to do … ”","If that sounds familiar, then that’s because it is. TechCrunch listed 11 separate controversies that resulted from Facebook being caught taking liberties with users’ data or trust. In most of these cases, the Zuckerberg response has been the same: sorrowful contrition followed by requests for forgiveness, topped off with resolutions to do better in future. The lad is beginning to sound like an alcoholic who, after his latest bout of drink-related excess, says sorry and expresses his determination to reform.","The trouble is that, as the veteran tech investor Om Malik pointed out this week, Facebook can’t reform without changing its very nature. “Facebook’s DNA,” he writes, “is that of a social platform addicted to growth and engagement. At its very core, every policy, every decision, every strategy is based on growth (at any cost) and engagement (at any cost). More growth and more engagement means more data – which means the company can make more advertising dollars, which gives it a nosebleed valuation on the stock market, which in turn allows it to remain competitive and stay ahead of its rivals.”","No amount of corporate spin can disguise that central truth. Facebook’s core business is exploiting the personal data of its users. That is its essence. So expecting it to wean itself off that exploitation is like trying to persuade ExxonMobil that it should get out of the oil and gas business.","That’s why the central question about the Cambridge Analytica controversy is whether it’s a scandal or a crisis. Scandals create a lot of noise and heat, but nothing much changes as a result. Crises are what lead to fundamental change. Facebook’s response – and its corporate DNA – suggest that it’s just a scandal. So stay tuned for the next data breach."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

Facebook, whose role in the 2016 presidential election has already been widely criticized, suspended Cambridge Analytica’s access to the service on Friday in light of the reports.","The harvested user information, collected under the guise of academic research, included the private social media activity of more than 50 million people. Cambridge Analytica’s data scientists were able to match about 30 million of those users with voter rolls and use that data to build psychographic models aimed at predicting and influencing votes — though the effectiveness of such methods is disputable.","Cambridge Analytica is owned by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah, and counted former Trump adviser and Breitbart chairman Stephen Bannon as one of its founders. One of the company’s other founders, Christopher Wylie, told the Times that the leaders of the firm wanted new weapons to “fight a culture war in America,” and that “rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","Speaking with the Observer, Wylie admitted that the company “exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” and then “built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.” (Wylie is also the subject of an extensive profile published by the Guardian on Saturday, which contains much more detail about his experiences with Cambridge Analytica.)","Wylie explained that the Mercers and Bannon wanted to remake American politics, and saw personality profiling as a way to help them accomplish that goal. The private Facebook information, collected in mid-2014, used link personality traits to voting preferences. The data was then used to tailor campaign messages that could take advantage of voters’ personality traits. Further underlining the shadiness of these efforts: they originally experimented in countries with weak privacy protections where politician clients would pass along government data.","Cambridge Analytica executives have been accused of exaggerating the usefulness of their methods, and it remains an open question how much of an impact their efforts had on the Trump campaign in 2016 (though no one is disputing how effective Trump’s overall digital operation was). Former campaign officials told the Times that the Cambridge Analytica’s services included “designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.”","The data breach, which was previously reported as far back as 2015, is one of the largest in Facebook’s history. The social media giant hasn’t addressed it until now, and insists it wasn’t a breach at all, merely a mishandling of user data. On Friday, the company announced that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica, its parent firm Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), Wylie (who left the company in late 2014), and the Russian-American academic Aleksandr Kogan, who originally collected the data using a Facebook app that asked users to complete a personality test-like survey.","In a statement announcing the temporary suspensions, Facebook said Kogan harvested the data legitimately, but then passed it along to third parties in violation of the social network’s terms. According to the Observer, Facebook failed to alert affected users about the breach, and “took only limited steps to recover and secure” the private information. Facebook had asked the firms to certify that the data had been deleted, which they did without actually following through, according to the Times. Wylie says that all Facebook did to confirm the data was deleted was to ask him to “tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Facebook vice-president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal insisted on Friday that while the platform’s terms were violated, “no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","The Times also reports that because many of the data scientists employed by Cambridge Analytica and SCL were foreigners, it’s possible that they violated U.S. election law, a charge Cambridge Analytica denies. The company is also being investigated by U.K. authorities over its data acquisition methods and possibly illegal efforts to influence voters to vote in favor of Brexit.","Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly demanding emails exchanged between Cambridge Analytica employees and Trump campaign staff members. One likely reason why: the Times says that a British affiliate of Cambridge Analytica claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. The Observer adds that Kogan, the Russian-American academic who collected the data, “has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research.”","Wikileaks founder Jullian Assange also alleged last year that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, contacted him during the campaign trying to get ahold of Hillary Clinton’s private emails. And Times reporters watched undercover footage of Nix bragging in January that he had employed front companies and former spies in service of his political clients, as well as discussing ways of entrapping politicians in compromising situations.","So far, no American political campaigns or super PACs have reported paying Cambridge Analytica for its services ahead of this year’s midterms."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

As a result, Fog Creek's impact on the world of developers rivals companies a thousand times our size.","Twitter! Twitter!","Strategy Letter II: Chicken and Egg Problems","The idea of advertising is to lie without getting caught. Most companies, when they run an advertising campaign, simply take the most unfortunate truth about their company, turn it upside down (“lie”), and drill that lie home. Let’s call it “proof by repeated assertion.” For example, plane travel is cramped and uncomfortable and airline employees are rude and unpleasant, indeed the whole commercial air system is designed as a means of torture. So almost all airline ads are going to be about how comfortable and pleasant it is to fly and how pampered you will be every step of the way. When British airways showed an ad with a businessman in a plane seat dreaming that he was a baby in a basket, all sense of reasonableness was gone for good.","Need another example? Paper companies are completely devastating our national forests, clear cutting old growth forest which they don’t even own. So when they advertise, they inevitably show some nice old pine forest and talk about how much they care about the environment. Cigarettes cause death, so their ads show life, like all the ads with happy smiling healthy people exercising outdoors. And so on.","When the Macintosh first came out, there was no software available for it. So obviously, Apple created a giant glossy catalog listing all the great software that was “available”. Half of the items listed said, in fine print, “under development,” and the other half couldn’t be had for love or money. Some were such lame products nobody would buy them. But even having a thick glossy catalog with one software “product” per page described in glowing prose couldn’t disguise the fact that you just could not buy a word processor or spreadsheet to run on your 128KB Macintosh. There were similar “software product guides” for NeXT and BeOS. (Attention, NeXT and BeOS bigots: I don’t need any flak about your poxy operating systems, OK? Write your own column.) The only thing a software product guide tells you is that there is no software available for the system. When you see one of these beasts, run fleeing in the opposite direction.","Amiga, Atari ST, Gem, IBM TopView, NeXT, BeOS, Windows CE, General Magic, the list of failed “new platforms” goes on and on. Because they are platforms, they are, by definition, not very interesting in and of themselves without juicy software to run on them. But, with very few exceptions (and I’m sure I’ll get a whole host of email from tedious supporters of arcane and unloved platforms like the Amiga or RSTS-11), no software developer with the least bit of common sense would intentionally write software for a platform with 100,000 users on a good day, like BeOS, when they could do the same amount of work and create software for a platform with 100,000,000 users, like Windows. The fact that anybody writes software for those oddball systems at all proves that the profit motive isn’t everything: religious fervor is still alive and well. Good for you, darling. You wrote a nice microEmacs clone for the Timex Sinclair 1000. Bravo. Here’s a quarter, buy yourself a treat.","So. If you’re in the platform creation business, you are probably going to suffer from what is commonly known as the chicken and egg problem. Nobody is going to buy your platform until there’s good software that runs on it, and nobody is going to write software until you have a big installed base. Ooops. It’s sort of like a Gordian Knot, although a Gordian Death Spiral might be more descriptive.","The chicken and egg problem, and variants thereof, is the most important element of strategy to understand. Well, OK, you can probably live without understanding it: Steve Jobs practically made a career out of not understanding the chicken and egg problem, twice. But the rest of us don’t have Jobs’ Personal Reality Distortion Field at our disposal, so we’ll have to buckle down and study hard.","Lesson one. The classic domain of chicken and egg problems is in software platforms. But here’s another chicken and egg problem: every month, millions of credit card companies mail out zillions of bills to consumers in the mail. People write paper checks, stuff them in trillions of envelopes, and mail them back. The envelopes are put in big boxes and taken to countries where labor is cheap to be opened and processed. But the whole operation costs quite a bit: the last figure I heard was that it is more than $1 per bill.","To us Internet wise-guys, that’s a joke. “Email me my bill”, you say. “I’ll pay it online!” You say. “It’ll only cost, say, 1/100000th of a penny. You’ll save millions” Or something like that.","And you’re right. So a lot of companies have tried to get into this field, which is technically known as Bill Presentment. One example is (guess who) Microsoft. Their solution, TransPoint, looks like this: it’s a web site. You go there, and it shows you your bills. You pay them.","So, now, if you get your bills on this Microsoft system, you have to visit the web page every few days to see if any bills have arrived so you don’t miss them. If you get, say, 10 bills a month, this might not be too big a hassle. Therein lies the other problem: there are only a small handful of merchants that will bill you over this system. So for all your other bills, you’ll have to go elsewhere.","End result? It’s not worth it. I would be surprised if 10,000 people are using this system. Now, Microsoft has to go to merchants and say, “bill your customers over our system!” And the merchants will say, “OK! How much will it cost?” And Microsoft will say, “50 cents! But it’s a lot cheaper than $1!” And the merchants will say, “OK. Anything else?” And Microsoft will say, “Oh yes, it will cost you about $250,000 to set up the software, connect our systems to your systems, and get everything working.”","And since Microsoft has so few dang users on this system, it’s hard to imagine why anyone would pay $250,000 to save 50 cents on 37 users. Aha! The chicken and egg problem has reared its ugly head! Customers won’t show up until you have merchants, and merchants won’t show up until you have customers! Eventually, Microsoft is just going to spend their way out of this predicament. For smaller companies, that’s not an option. So what can you do?","Software platforms actually gives us some nice hints as to how to roast your chicken and egg problem. Let’s look a bit at the history of personal computer software platforms in the years since the IBM-PC came out; maybe we’ll discover something!","Most people think that the IBM-PC required PC-DOS. Not true. When the IBM-PC first came out, you had a choice of three operating systems: PC-DOS, XENIX (a wimpy 8 bit version of UNIX published by, and I am not making this up, Microsoft), and something called UCSD P-System, which was, if you can believe this, just like Java: nice, slow, portable bytecodes, about 20 years before Java.","Now, most people have never heard of XENIX or UCSD’s weirdo stuff. You kids today probably think that this is because Microsoft took over the market for dinky operating systems through marketing muscle or something. Absolutely not true; Microsoft was tiny in those days. The company with the marketing muscle was Digital Research, which had a different operating system. So, why was PC-DOS the winner of the three way race?","Before the PC, the only real operating system you could get was CP/M, although the market for CP/M based computers, which cost about $10,000, was too small. They were cranky and expensive and not very user friendly. But those who did buy them, did so to use as word processors, because you could get a pretty good word processor called WordStar for CP/M, and the Apple II just could not do word processing (it didn’t have lower case, to begin with).","Now, here’s a little known fact: even DOS 1.0 was designed with a CP/M backwards compatibility mode built in. Not only did it have its own spiffy new programming interface, known to hard core programmers as INT 21, but it fully supported the old CP/M programming interface. It could almost run CP/M software. In fact, WordStar was ported to DOS by changing one single byte in the code. (Real Programmers can tell you what that byte was, I’ve long since forgotten).","That bears mentioning again. WordStar was ported to DOS by changing one single byte in the code. Let that sink in.","There.","Got it?","DOS was popular because it had software from day one. And it had software because Tim Paterson had thought to include a CP/M compatibility feature in it, because way back in the dark ages somebody was smart about chicken and egg problems.","Fast forward. In the entire history of the PC platform, there have only been two major paradigm shifts that took along almost every PC user: we all switched to Windows 3.x, and then we all switched to Windows 95. Only a tiny number of people ever switched to anything else on the way. Microsoft conspiracy to take over the world? Fine, you’re welcome to think that. I think it’s for another, more interesting reason, which just comes back to the chicken and the egg.","We all switched to Windows 3.x. The important clue in that sentence is the 3. Why didn’t we all switch to Windows 1.0? Or Windows 2.0? Or Windows 286 or Windows 386 which followed? Is it because it takes Microsoft five releases to “get it right”? No.","The actual reason was even more subtle than that, and it has to do with a very arcane hardware features that first showed up on the Intel 80386 chip which Windows 3.0 required.","Feature one: old DOS programs put things on the screen by writing directly to memory locations which corresponded to character cells on the screen. This was the only way to do output fast enough to make your program look good. But Windows ran in graphics mode. On older Intel chips, the Microsoft engineers had no choice but to flip into full screen mode when they were running DOS programs. But on the 80386, they could set up virtual memory blocks and set interrupts so that the operating system was notified whenever a program tried to write to screen memory. Windows could then write the equivalent text into a graphical window on the screen instantly.","Feature two: old DOS programs assumed they had the run of the chip. As a result, they didn’t play well together. But the Intel 80386 had the ability to create “virtual” PCs, each of them acting like a complete 8086, so old PC programs could pretend like they had the computer to themselves, even while other programs were running and, themselves, pretending they had the whole computer to themselves.","So Windows 3.x on Intel 80386s was the first version that could run multiple DOS programs respectably. (Technically, Windows 386 could too, but 80386s were rare and expensive until about the time that Windows 3.0 came out.) Windows 3.0 was the first version that could actually do a reasonable job running all your old software.","Windows 95? No problem. Nice new 32 bit API, but it still ran old 16 bit software perfectly. Microsoft obsessed about this, spending a big chunk of change testing every old program they could find with Windows 95. Jon Ross, who wrote the original version of SimCity for Windows 3.x, told me that he accidentally left a bug in SimCity where he read memory that he had just freed. Yep. It worked fine on Windows 3.x, because the memory never went anywhere. Here’s the amazing part: On beta versions of Windows 95, SimCity wasn’t working in testing. Microsoft tracked down the bug and added specific code to Windows 95 that looks for SimCity. If it finds SimCity running, it runs the memory allocator in a special mode that doesn’t free memory right away. That’s the kind of obsession with backward compatibility that made people willing to upgrade to Windows 95.","You should be starting to get some ideas about how to break the chicken and egg problem: provide a backwards compatibility mode which either delivers a truckload of chickens, or a truckload of eggs, depending on how you look at it, and sit back and rake in the bucks.","Ah. Now back to bill presentment. Remember bill presentment? The chicken-egg problem is that you can only get your Con Ed bills, so you won’t use the service. How can you solve it? Microsoft couldn’t figure it out. PayMyBills.com (and a half dozen other Silicon Valley startups) all figured it out at the same time. You provide a backwards compatibility mode: if the merchant won’t support the system, just get the merchant to mail their damn paper bills to University Avenue, in Palo Alto, where a bunch of actual human beings will open them and scan them in. Now you can get all your bills on their web site. Since every merchant on earth is available on the system, customers are happy to use it, even if it is running in this weird backwards compatibility mode where stupid Visa member banks send the bill electronically to a printer, print it out on paper, stuff it in an envelope, ship it 1500 miles to California, where it is cut open, the stupid flyers harping worthless “free” AM clock radios that actually cost $9.95 are thrown into a landfill somewhere, and the paper bill is scanned back into a computer and stuck up on the web where it should have been sent in the first place. But the stupid backwards compatibility mode will eventually go away, because PayMyBills.com, unlike Microsoft, can actually get customers to use their system, so pretty soon they’ll be able to go to the stupid Visa member banks and say, “hey, I’ve got 93,400 of your customers. Why don’t you save yourselves $93,400 each month with a direct wire connection to me?” And suddenly PayMyBills.com is very profitable while Microsoft is still struggling to sign up their second electric utility, maybe one serving Georgia would be a nice change of pace.","Companies that fail to recognize the Chicken and Egg problem can be thought of as boil the ocean companies: their business plan requires 93,000,000 humans to cooperate with their crazy business scheme before it actually works. One of the most outrageously stupid ideas I ever encountered was called ActiveNames. Their boneheaded idea was that everybody in the world would install a little add-in to their email client which looked up people’s names on their central servers to get the actual email address. Then instead of telling people that your email address is kermit@sesame-street.com, you would tell them that your ActiveName is “spolsky”, and if they want to email you, they need to install this special software. Bzzzzzt. Wrong answer. I can’t even begin to list all the reasons this idea is never going to work.","Conclusion: if you’re in a market with a chicken and egg problem, you better have a backwards-compatibility answer that dissolves the problem, or it’s going to take you a loooong time to get going (like, forever).","There are a lot of other companies that recognized the chicken and egg problem face on and defeated it intelligently. When Transmeta unveiled their new CPU, it was the first time in a long time that a company that was not Intel finally admitted that if you’re a CPU, and you want a zillion people to buy you, you gotta run x86 code. This after Hitachi, Motorola, IBM, MIPS, National Semiconductor, and who knows how many other companies deceived themselves into thinking that they had the right to invent a new instruction set. The Transmeta architecture assumes from day one that any business plan that calls for making a computer that doesn’t run Excel is just not going anywhere."],"isopubdate":"2000-05-24"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said in a statement.","Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) sent a letter to Zuckerberg on Monday demanding that Facebook list every instance in the past 10 years in which a third-party company violated Facebook’s privacy rules while collecting data on users.","Top UK regulator Elizabeth Denham has announced an investigation into the legality of the Facebook data breach. And Antonio Tajani, the head of the European Parliament, said the allegations against Facebook, if true, would mark “an unacceptable violation of our citizens’ privacy rights” and called for the European Parliament to conduct a full investigation.","The political and financial blows to the company began after the New York Times and the UK’s Observer published blockbuster reports over the weekend showing that the analytics firm Cambridge Analytica secretly obtained the personal data of millions of Facebook users. In 2014, the firm worked with Aleksandr Kogan, a scholar at Cambridge University, to administer a personality test through a Facebook app in which users agreed to allow their personal information to be collected.","But it turned out that this app didn’t just scrape the personal data of the roughly 270,000 users who agreed to take the personality quiz. It also scraped info from the friends of people who took it. That, in turn, meant tens of millions of Facebook users had their data collected without their permission or knowledge.","That privacy breach may have had significant political effects. The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016. It’s unclear at the moment if Cambridge Analytica made direct use of the secretly harvested data for Trump’s campaign, but according to the Times, the data was used for “developing techniques that underpinned its work” on the campaign. Cambridge Analytica also worked with the British political operation that successfully campaigned for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 “Brexit” referendum.","The possibility that millions of people’s personal data could’ve been used to influence such important political events has laid bare how consequential data breaches of this scale can be. And it could strengthen arguments saying that Facebook can’t be trusted to protect user privacy all by itself.","Facebook failed to crack down on Cambridge Analytica’s data mining","Cambridge Analytica specializes in what’s called “psychographic” profiling, meaning it uses data collected online to create personality profiles for voters. It then takes that information and targets individuals with specifically tailored political advertising. Access to the personal data of millions of Facebook users would be hugely valuable to the firm.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on,” Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee who went public about the data breach, told the Observer.","Facebook found out about Cambridge Analytica’s breach in 2015, but it didn’t notify users who had their data taken without their permission. And it didn’t take particularly strong measures to correct the leak, which is one of the largest in the company’s history.","Facebook lawyers sent a letter to Cambridge Analytica in August 2016 asking them to destroy any data they held that they had sucked up from Facebook without permission, but Facebook never followed up or made any attempts to confirm that Cambridge had actually done so with investigations. Only on Monday, years after learning of the breach, and days after the emergence of these explosive reports, did Facebook announce that it would conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica to see if it actually got rid of the data.","Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it did not hold on to the data that was extracted without consent and that it did not use it for political operations. But copies of the data extracted by Cambridge Analytica exist to this day, according to the Times, whose reporters had access to raw data from the breach.","Cambridge Analytica had big ties with Trumpworld: Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire and conservative political donor, owns the data firm, and Steve Bannon — the man who would become Trump’s campaign manager in 2016 — was a vice president there at the time of the breach.","Governments want to hold Facebook accountable","Now regulators and policymakers in the US and abroad are furious with Facebook and calling for investigations into just what happened.","Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told the Washington Post that Zuckerberg and other tech executives need to publicly answer about what went wrong.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said.","Two former Federal Trade Commission employees told the Washington Post that Facebook could be fined for billions of dollars for violating a 2011 agreement it formed with the FTC over user privacy. Wyden’s letter to Zuckerberg asks him for a copy of every Facebook privacy assessment written since that 2011 agreement.","Republicans have also suggested that they’re open hearings.","“People have to look into it. Whether or not it broke the law, absolutely, the privacy of the American consumer, the American individual, should be protected,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said on CNN on Sunday.","In the US, the public backlash against Facebook could provide a boost for bipartisan legislation such as the Honest Ads Act, which calls for the government to regulate online political advertising the same way it does television, radio, and print advertising. It would require tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Twitter to keep data on anyone who spends more than $500 in political advertising on their platform. Among other things, the companies would be expected to keep copies of the advertisements and information about the organizations that purchased them.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), one of the sponsors of the bill, said in a statement on Saturday. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Over in the UK, Facebook faces mounting pressure as well. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesperson called the allegations “very concerning” and backed Denham’s call for an investigation. And British MP Damian Collins said he would call Zuckerberg and the head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, to testify before Parliament."],"isopubdate":"2004-01-02"}

The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand.","Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network.","He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them.","“Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it.","“Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.”","Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland.","(NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.)","The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges.","The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results).","And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value — and led to a bunch of lawsuits.","“We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on.","“Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.”","He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account.","So, er, ouch.","In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner himself as, er, hostile to privacy…","A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement:","We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further.","This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions.","Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!).","The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning.","Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook.","Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period.","Downloaded FB data also gives you insight into whom else has data on you (used to run custom audiences). Have never engaged with 75% of these… pic.twitter.com/dQPjIcI8CW","“I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.”","Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot.","But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users.","“They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.”","“Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large.","“It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?”","“They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks. If you think about how antitrust laws work, that’s the starting point for those laws. So it’s kind of mindboggling that they don’t see their argumentation, how it’s going to hurt them at some point.”","from Social – TechCrunch https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/facebook-just-lost-another-user-new-zealands-privacy-commissioner/","Reactions:","Google+ Followers","Popular Posts","Indian telecom operator Reliance Jio is in talks with Xiaomi to bring the Xiaomi Smart TVs in India along with the JioFiber bundle.

In the aftermath of Donald Trump's victory, a legend is being built around London-based Cambridge Analytica, which advised Trump's campaign using \"big data\" -- one of the most magical phrases in tech.","That legend should be taken with a grain of salt, though. Trump didn't really win because he ran a smarter, more tech-savvy campaign than Hillary Clinton.","On Nov. 3, Jim Messina, who managed President Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, published an op-ed piece in The New York Times that concluded, \"As we move into the final days of the 2016 election cycle, the smart money is on the campaigns -- like Mrs. Clinton's -- that are leveraging the power of data to find every last vote they can.\" The Trump campaign, Messina claimed, wasn't doing that, having learned no lessons from Obama's success.","Messina also held that \"big data\" was an outdated concept and the future of political campaigning depended on what he termed \"little data\": \"Huge data sets are often less helpful in understanding an electorate than one or two key data points — for instance, what issue is most important to a particular undecided voter.\" Buzzwords are treacherous, though; getting to Messina's \"little data\" -- ideally, targeting messages to every individual -- is exactly the point of \"big data\" research. And, just like Clinton, Trump paid for the assistance.","Senator Ted Cruz was the first Republican presidential candidate to hire Cambridge Analytica, whose approach is based on a combination of data collection -- from social networks and any big database it can get its hands on -- and psychometry, an approach that maps personality based on the so-called OCEAN criteria: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. This is \"little data\" concentrated to a pinpoint: The researchers attempt to figure out the psychological profile of every voter who could be susceptible to a campaign's message. Then, they advise the campaign on microtargeting the messages by pushing, for example, a candidate's outsider credentials to a low-conscientiousness individual or his solid service record to a high-conscientiousness one.","I heard Cruz's staffers brag about their data-driven campaign in Iowa, where Cruz won the primary. They smugly explained that they knew where to send each postcard, whom to call, on which doors to knock. Then I heard distraught voters on local conservative talk radio complain about a flyer Cruz sent out. It looked like a government document and exhorted Iowans to caucus to \"improve your score\" as voters. One former Cruz supporter even wept about what she described as a crude attempt to dupe her. All the data gathering and psychological profiling didn't keep Cruz from a blooper that Trump immediately exploited.","Then, of course, Cruz fell hopelessly behind Trump. I doubt Cambridge Analytica would have found its way to advising the Trump campaign had Steve Bannon not been on its board of directors. In October, however, both Bannon and the company were on board, and Bloomberg News reported that Cambridge Analytica's data scientists were looking for voters who could save the election for Trump or lose it for Clinton. Both groups were bombarded with ads on social networks: Enthusiastic Trump supporters got ones that would get them even more fired up, and reluctant Clinton backers ones that would reduce their motivation to vote. For example, the Trump campaign showed black voters a clip of Clinton's \"superpredator\" remark.","Again, I would have believed in the efficiency of these shamanic manipulations had I not been the recipient of numerous e-mail messages from the Trump campaign that designated me as a \"Big League Supporter\" and doggedly asked for contributions and moral support, though I am disqualified as a Russian citizen. Whatever contact lists Trump's data team had, it didn't even match them against open social network data. Cambridge Analytica's microtargeting was obviously failing in my case. Even though I'd given my e-mail address to the campaigns of Bernie Sanders's and Clinton, too, as I registered for their rallies, they didn't senselessly bombard me with messages as Trump did.","Now, Cambridge Analytica is in great demand. Media outlets tout it as the great Trump-maker and rarely fail to mention its involvement in the Brexit campaign. A story in the Swiss weekly Das Magazin that describes the company as the dark mastermind behind the Trump win is making the rounds on German-speaking social networks, and I'm pretty sure Cambridge will make lots of money off European populists who dream of Trump's success. The days when Clinton was supposed to be riding a big data machine to victory are forgotten.","Had she won, Clinton's head of analytics, Elan Kriegel, would be where Cambridge Analytica is now. But in a contest of sorcerers, the loser is never truly magical.","Michal Kosinski, a Stanford professor, was one of a small group of researchers that pioneered the marriage between psychometry and big data. I asked him whether he believed big data had won the day for Trump.","\"Obviously, it is not big data analytics that wins the election,\" he wrote back. \"Candidates do. We don't know how much his victory was helped by big data analytics.\"","You won't hear this blunt message from companies that peddle Kosinski's methods to politicians. What they're selling is not exactly snake oil, though it can work as a placebo for panicky candidates who are down in the polls with weeks to go before Election Day. Data science and its applications to psychology are promising fields that, as Kosinski notes, tread a thin ethical line because of their treatment of private data. But just like artificial intelligence or, say, the blockchain, they aren't killer apps that can ensure a political victory or business success. During the U.S. election campaign, I watched Cruz campaign tirelessly in Iowa, making up to seven stops a day in unheated barns and tiny diners. I watched Trump improve his campaigning technique and crisscross the country with a message that wasn't microtargeted but that resonated powerfully with many people I met.","I also watched Clinton fail to connect, even though her campaign made use of data analytics before Trump got into that game. There is no scientific cure for this kind of thing, and no victory elixir.","This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.","To contact the author of this story: Leonid Bershidsky at lbershidsky@bloomberg.net."],"isopubdate":""}

The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling firm funded by right-wing donors and used by the Trump campaign, acquired personal information about 50 million unwitting Facebook users in 2014 by creating a data-harvesting personality quiz app that a Cambridge Analytica associate pretended to be using for academic purposes. \"Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove,\" the Times reported.","Facebook preempted the reporting by suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its app developer — as well as the account of Christopher Wiley, the whistleblower who alerted reporters to the scope of Cambridge Analytica's data-scraping operation. The Times' story, and a contemporaneous story in the Observer (a sister publication to the Guardian), led to calls from British and American lawmakers for Facebook to explain its user protections.","Is this a turning point for Facebook — or for would-be regulators of the social media giant? Or is it just a reflection of the way our data routinely gets exploited in the social media era? Here's what analysts are saying.","This Scandal Is Proof That Facebook Cannot Be Trusted To Protect Users On Its Own","John Thornhill sounds the alarm about Cambridge Analytica's abuse of Facebook users' private information and calls for stronger regulation of social media companies like Facebook.","[T]hese companies have been built to maximise profits rather than optimise social good. Their business is to encourage advertising-generating clicks rather than democracy-enhancing content.","If market forces will never compel these companies to reorient their goals, then governments can be expected to do so for them, particularly in Europe. The German government has already implemented a law slapping heavy fines on platforms that fail to take down illegal content sufficiently quickly. In May, the EU's 28 member countries will adopt the General Data Protection Regulation, constraining the exploitation of personal data. The nuclear option would be to reclassify such platforms as publishers, making them as responsible for the content they host as newspapers or broadcasters.","Facebook Needs To Abandon Its Self-Justifying Impulses And Invite More Critics Into The Company","TechCrunch's Josh Constine criticizes Facebook's defensive response to the scandal and says that the company must change its internal culture if it wants to prevent more and more of these privacy scandals from eroding its user base and necessitating stronger governmental oversight.","Facebook is going to lengths to fight the news cycle surrounding its controversies instead of owning up early and getting to work. Facebook knew about Cambridge Analytica’s data policy violations since at least August 2016, but did nothing but send a legal notice to delete the information. It only suspended the Facebook accounts of Cambridge Analytica and other guilty parties and announced the move this week in hopes of muting forthcoming New York Times and Guardian articles about the issue (articles which it also tried to prevent from running via legal threats.) And since, representatives of the company have quibbled with reporters over Twitter, describing the data misuse as a “breach” instead of explaining why it didn't inform the public about it for years...","Facebook still seems to lack or ignore the cynics and diverse voices who might foresee how its products could be perverted or were conceptualized foolishly in the first place. Having more minorities and contrarians on the teams that conceive its products could nip troubles in the bud before they blossom.","Cambridge Analytica's Tactics May Be Troubling, But They're Hardly Unusual","Data security expert Kalev Leetaru, writing in Forbes, writes that Cambridge Analytica's alleged data-mining operation is par for the course for academic and private researchers. Leetaru summarizes a number of studies over the years that have used Facebook users' information without their informed consent and argues that what's changed isn't researchers' techniques but the public's awareness of and concern about potential privacy violations.","Not a day goes by that I don't see a request on an academic mailing list from a university researcher looking to extract a large volume of material from Facebook or announcing a new tool to make bulk extraction of user information from the platform easier. Any change the platform makes to restrict bulk access to its data is met with cries of foul. On the sidelines of any academic social sciences conference can be found any number of academics offering to ship bulk extracted Facebook data to fellow researchers.","Moreover, even when social media platforms become aware of explicit violations of their terms of service by researchers, it is unclear what consequences, if any, those researchers face.","Facebook Needs To Work With Researchers To Increase Accountability For Data Analysts","Technology ethicists Jacob Metcalf and Casey Fiesler argue that the solution to violations of the trust between Facebook and its users isn't to tamp down on research using data from social media platforms but to open up transparent channels between researchers and platforms and to give users a more informed say over how their data is used.","We don't wish to reduce the amount of access researchers have to platforms. Quite the opposite. Increased access is necessary to build the infrastructures and norms of ethical research in this new frontier of science. Genuinely academic research shouldn't need to rely on manipulative viral quizzes to study these technologies at the heart of society. We should have a portal that allows registered researchers to query anonymized data from users who have consented to have their data offered to us, without ever needing the data to leave Facebook's own servers. This would open up doors for more research while also giving users more control over who has access to their data. Hopefully the lesson that the major platforms take from this scandal is that lack of open dialog about ethical research practices is precisely why they are exposed to the consequences of unethical research practices by third parties.","When It Comes To Micro-Targeted Political Advertising, The Cat's Out Of The Bag","The Atlantic's Alexis C. Madrigal spells out the danger of Cambridge Analytica's data-harvesting operation. It's not just that they have Americans' private data, it's that they might now have the means to show targeted political advertising to Americans based on their Facebook profiles. (And Facebook still lets advertisers target users based on just about any imaginable attribute.)","It's not just that the data escaped, but that Cambridge Analytica almost certainly learned everything they could from it. As stated in The Guardian, the contract between GSR and Strategic Communications Laboratories states, specifically, \"The ultimate product of the training set is creating a 'gold standard' of understanding personality from Facebook profile information.\"","It's important to dwell on this. It's not that this research was supposed to identify every U.S. voter just from this data, but rather to develop a method for sorting people based on Facebook's profiles. Wylie believes that the data was crucial in building Cambridge Analytica's models. It certainly seems possible that once the \"training set\" had been used to learn how to psychologically profile people, this specific data itself was no longer necessary.","Showers are a respite from the world, offering comfort and privacy, and we'd prefer them not be agonizingly cold unless there are verified health benefits we'll miss out on if we don't crank down the hot water.","monday.com has built a team management tool that boosts productivity and collaboration, brings transparency to teams of any size, and connects people to processes.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/23/free-speech-suit-aims-prevent-twitter-blocking-users-based-political-views/","title":"'Free Speech' Suit Aims to End Twitter's Political Censorship | Breitbart","text":["‘Free Speech’ Suit Aims to End Twitter’s Political Censorship","A group of free-speech lawyers filed the most serious legal challenge yet to Twitter’s censorship policies Tuesday in San Francisco County Superior Court, seeking a ruling preventing Twitter from banning users purely on the basis of their views and political associations.","The 29-page complaint contends that, under a California legal doctrine that recognizes some private facilities as “public forums,” Twitter may not discriminate against speech on their platform based purely on viewpoint. If successful, it would be the first extension of that doctrine to internet social media platforms and could transform the way free speech is treated online. The suit became all the more relevant Wednesday as Twitter stood accused of locking out thousands of conservatives under the guise of cracking down on “Russian bots.”","The genesis of the suit is Twitter’s November 2017 announcement that they would start banning and sanctioning users based on their offline behavior and associations. On December 18, 2017, Twitter, five years after their top British executive described the company as “the free speech wing of the free speech party,” made good on this threat, “purging” hundreds of mostly right-wing users. Twitter’s new policy refers to association with “violent extremist groups,” and a company blog post claimed, “If an account’s profile information includes a violent threat or multiple slurs, epithets, racist or sexist tropes, incites fear, or reduces someone to less than human, it will be permanently suspended.”","One of those purged is Jared Taylor, founder and editor of “American Renaissance,” a fringe-right journal on race and immigration. He is frequently described as an “extremist” and a “white supremacist” by left-wing groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the latter of which sits on Twitter’s “Trust and Safety Council,” the largely leftist group of activists and non-profits Twitter assembled in 2016 to help decide which speech to censor.","Taylor is a graduate of Yale University and Paris’s Sciences Po, the former West Coast editor of PC Magazine, and author of several books. He describes himself as a “white advocate” or “race realist” and condemns Nazism and antisemitism.","According to the complaint, in his more than six years on Twitter, Taylor never made threats, harassed anyone, or otherwise came under scrutiny for his behavior on the platform. Even the SPLC notes Taylor “scrupulously avoided racist epithets [and] employed the language of academic journals” in his writings, and Taylor once wrote an article urging people to be more civil on Twitter.","As the complaint puts it:","Mr. Taylor has always expressed his views with respect and civility towards those who disagree. He has never engaged in vituperation or name-calling, on Twitter or elsewhere.","Neither Mr. Taylor nor American Renaissance has ever promoted or advocated violence, on Twitter or anywhere else. Indeed, they have urged their followers to maintain a dignified and respectful tone towards those who disagree with them. Neither Mr. Taylor nor American Renaissance is affiliated with any groups that promote or practice violence.","At no time did either Mr. Taylor’s or American Renaissance’s accounts engage in “trolling,” insults, or harassment, nor did they ever encourage anyone else to do such thing","Yet both Taylor’s personal account and that of American Renaissance were permanently banned. The only explanation Twitter gave was that the accounts were “affiliated with a violent extremist group.” Twitter refused to offer Taylor any further details including to which “violent extremist group” he was affiliated.","Representing Taylor in his effort to be reinstated to Twitter are Michigan State University Law professor Dr. Adam Candeub and Washington, DC, attorney Noah Peters, with Nevada free speech lawyer Marc Rondazza acting as local counsel. Peters spoke with Breitbart News about his complaint.","“If you’re the functional equivalent of a traditional public forum … even the private company that owns it can’t prohibit common expressive activities completely … they can’t selectively kick people out and allow certain people to speak and not others,” Peters explained of California’s unique privately owned public forum doctrine.","This “Pruneyard Doctrine” grows out of a 1979 California Supreme Court interpretation of the California Constitution’s version of the First Amendment, Robin v. Pruneyard Shopping Center, that held private owners could not prevent speech on their property when it functions like a traditional public venue for speech. “The classic examples are sidewalks, parks, and, in the case of Pruneyard, a shopping mall, a railroad terminal, probably an airport terminal, but that hasn’t been squarely decided,” Peters explained.","The crux of their lawsuit is that, in the 21st Century, social media platforms are the most natural “public forums” in which people exchange ideas, and that the Pruneyard Doctrine ought to be extended to prevent viewpoint discrimination and arbitrary restrictions on speech on these privately owned websites. Peters explained to Breitbart News the 1970s California Supreme Court’s reasoning in creating the doctrine. It focused on the importance of public drives for signatures to the referendum process in California, worrying that if the privately owned public places where people congregate were closed off to flyering and signature collectors, it could do serious harm to the functioning of the political system.","Peters put it as follows:","All of those concerns are much more amplified on Twitter. It’s become the premiere forum for politicians and government agencies to communicate with people. People are holding constituent meetings, town halls – and Twitter is encouraging this. It also provides an unprecedented level of access to politicians, direct access to journalists … it would be very difficult to become a public figure or to engage in political debate if you’re not on Twitter.","Every candidate for public office – virtually – has a Twitter. These are circumstances that were unknown to the Pruneyard court back in 1979, but this is what they were aiming at on steroids. Twitter is the modern public square.","As the complaint points out, the U.S. Supreme Court called internet social media the “modern public square” last year in an 8-0 decision holding a law that made it a felony for sex offenders to use social media after their release violated the First Amendment.","Breitbart News asked Peters about the likely objection from laissez faire types that Twitter is a private company and should be able to do as it likes with its platform. “This affects interests that are so much larger than property rights – the ability to participate meaningfully in Democracy, to be able to speak without censorship – which are really fundamental basic rights,” he replied.","Peters was quick to draw a distinction between so-called “time-place-manner” restrictions on speech, which he freely admits Twitter has a right to enforce, and viewpoint discrimination, which his suit is challenging. “In this lawsuit we don’t say that free expression means you have the right to harass and threaten people, and to be disrespectful, or to use obscene language, or to post obscene things,” he tells Breitbart News. “What they can’t do – and what’s really inimical to free speech – is kicking people off because of their perceived off-platform affiliations and because of their viewpoints.”","Breitbart News asked why Taylor, a man often reviled as a racist, would serve as the test case. “The issue in the lawsuit is not whether Taylor himself’s views are right or wrong, or really anything to do with his views. The issue here is the larger principle of internet censorship and internet free speech,” Peters replied.","“In every First Amendment case, the plaintiff – the person who’s complaining – is an unpopular figure. You have communists, draft-dodgers, Jehovah’s Witnesses, more recently you had Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church,” Peters said, referencing the plaintiffs in the most famous free speech cases of the last 100 years. “Even every authoritarian country, you can always be praising whoever’s in charge. You can always write things that flatter their policies. That doesn’t mean you have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech only matters when it protects viewpoints that we don’t like, that are controversial.”","Censorship does not start with silencing mainstream figures, Peters argues, but those on fringes:","Twitter is not going to make Donald Trump the test case. They’re not going to make Chuck Schumer the test case. They’re not going to make someone who’s popular the test case. It never works that way. It’s always people who are on the fringes, who are widely hated, who are the ones who need the protection of the First Amendment. Jared Taylor’s views are controversial. That’s exactly why we have to make sure he has the right to express those views.","“The guiding principle of our First Amendment jurisprudence is that we protect the thought we hate,” Peters continued, paraphrasing Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the jurist who more than any other cemented our modern understanding of free speech.","The lawsuit also alleges Twitter is violating California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination on the basis of political beliefs and brings a breach of contract claim on the basis of advertising purchases Taylor made with Twitter to build his follower base only to be banned without compensation.","Twitter’s recent controversies, allegedly punishing more mainstream conservatives, makes Peters’s contention that what starts with Taylor doesn’t end with him look prescient. Wednesday’s #TwitterLockout is only the latest in a long time of scandals involving Twitter’s disfavoring of right-leaning speech. A former Twitter employee told Breitbart News, “It wasn’t a mistake. They defined Trump supporters as bots. The only reason they are backpedaling is [because] they got caught.”","Recent undercover reporting appears to confirm years of complaints from conservatives about mistreatment, including “shadow-banning” and unfair suspension because of liberal bias at the Silicon Valley giant. From this, it can be inferred that if Taylor’s lawsuit reaches discovery and his lawyers are allowed to obtain internal Twitter documents on his banning, it may transform our understanding of how Twitter disfavors the Right online.","If Taylor prevails in the California court system and successfully expands the Pruneyard Doctrine to Silicon Valley’s social media companies, it could entirely upend the meaning of free speech on the internet and give the — mostly conservative — voices that feel they are being silenced a cause of action against the overwhelmingly leftist and increasingly intolerant big tech.","Breitbart News contacted a Twitter representative for a comment on Candeub, Randazza, and Peters’s lawsuit but received no reply.","The case is Taylor v. Twitter, CGC-18-564460 in San Francisco County Superior Court."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-23"}

But Cambridge Analytica's harvesting of more than 50 million Americans' personal information without their knowledge or consent is really just a byproduct of the larger disease.","Facebook says that it is “outraged” over the brewing scandal and that it “will take whatever steps are required” to prevent a similar incident from happening again. But why should anyone trust them? Their business model, as well as countless other online companies', is to control and then sell to advertisers microtargeted connections to the most massive collection of personal data in human history, encompassing literally billions of people.","The more that people understand how Facebook actually works, the less they’ll like it.","That it why Facebook — along with Google, Verizon, and other tech giants — is at this very moment vigorously trying to stop a California ballot initiative that would go a long way in allowing users to protect themselves from falling prey to the exact kind of unknowing data collection about which Facebook says it is so upset.","The LA Times reported on Tuesday that Facebook is plowing a $200,000 into a political action committee whose goal is to prevent California residents from voting on a measure that would bring much needed transparency to what data tech companies collect and how that data can be used. As the LA Times described it, the proposed ballot measure \"would require companies to disclose what personal information from Californians they collect, buy or share [and] allow many consumers to 'opt out' from those practices.\"","The reason that the proponents of the ballot initiative feel it's necessary is that Facebook knows everything about you — more than even your closest friends and family members — and not just the information that you may choose to post to your personal profile. They know many of the websites you visit, all the sites you are forced to sign into using your Facebook information, the drafts of posts you delete, what music you listen to and where you are at all times of the day when the app is open. And there's no simple way to find out what all they know, with whom they share it or how to change or stop it.","The sheer volume of information they have on you, as well as your limited ability to stop them from collecting it, is why 89% of all new advertising income is going to Facebook and Google.","To protect that business model, Facebook in some cases actively attempts prevent users from knowing exactly all the data it has on you and how they gather that data. That’s why it took a years-long legal fight in Europe to force them to allow users to download an archive of your profile information. It’s why Facebook refuses to disclose how its friend recommending system works, despite the fact that it outs people all the time who would prefer to keep their identity siloed and private. It’s partly why Facebook refuses to release all the political ads bought by Russian actors and countless others.","It’s not just about protecting “trade secrets.” The more that people understand how Facebook actually works, the less they’ll like it. This is why we often have to rely on leaks to the press to understand how Facebook actually works.","This tension between the need for transparency and maximizing profits has reportedly played out internally at Facebook. Facebook’s chief of security, Alex Stamos, will allegedly be leaving the company later this year over disputes with the policy and legal team over transparency around the Russia ads. The New York Times reported that “The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives.”","Their business model is to control and then sell to advertisers microtargeted connections to the most massive collection of personal data in human history.","The organizers of the important California ballot initiative are calling on Facebook to drop its opposition to the measure in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica, but you can bet they that won’t. With its massive population, California laws are a bellwether for the rest of the country and, if it passes, it’s likely that Facebook would have to comply nationwide, or that other states would soon follow.","Facebook can talk all it wants about how upset they are that its firehose of personal data was misused, but until they provide users the tools to truly control their own data, you can expect something similar to happen again.","Trevor Timm is the executive director of Freedom of the Press Foundation. His writing has also recently appeared in the New York Times, the Guardian, USA Today and the Columbia Journalism Review.","CORRECTION (March 22, 2018 10:45 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the amount that Facebook has donated to a political action committee opposing the privacy ballot initiative.

It made it clear that most senior and mid-level positions involving strategy, planning, fundraising or campaigning needed to be filled by US citizens.","“Any decision maker must be a US citizen or green card holder,” the memo, seen by the Observer, warned. It also provided a brief legal history of cases involving foreign involvement in election campaigns, drawn up by a lawyer at the firm founded by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.","“To the extent you are aware of foreign nationals providing services, including polling and marketing, it would appear that unless it is being done through US citizens, or foreign nationals with green cards, the activity would violate the law.”","It was clear that as a company largely run and staffed by Britons and Canadians, apart from Bannon and Mercer at the top, Cambridge Analytica – which was to go on to work on Donald’s Trump presidential election campaign – had a looming problem.","“The prohibition against foreign nationals managing campaigns, including making direct or indirect decisions regarding the expenditure of campaign dollars, will have a significant impact on how Cambridge hires staff and operates in the short term,” the memo stated.","It specifically called for Nix to step down from work on US elections. “In order for Cambridge to engage in such activities, Mr Nix would first have to be recused from substantive management of any such clients involved in US elections,” it said.","Employees working for Cambridge Analytica in the US at the time claimed that rather than tackling the problem, management appeared to ignore it.","“Mercer’s lawyer told a fairly stunned group meeting that it wasn’t allowed,” said one non-American employee who was based in the US at the time. “I’m not sure what, if anything, CA did to act on that knowledge.”","Two employees confirmed that they were still answering ultimately to Nix throughout the mid-term election campaigns that ended in November 2014. In total, more than a dozen foreigners, including Britons and Canadians, filled strategic roles in campaigns across the US.","“We were really speaking directly to the voters in a number of states,” said one former employee, who served on a team with several people who were not US citizens or green card holders.","It is understood that some were working on tourist visas. Another ex-employee claimed that they had been provided with letters to give to US border control officials where needed, stating that they would not be working there.","Robert Mercer, the owner of Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images","“One colleague kept raising these issues, so they gave us a piece of paper to give to immigration to say we weren’t actually working,” the second former employee said. They added that the company appeared to have taken advantage of its mostly young workforce. “It was getting a chance to travel, and to work on campaigns. Having a lot of autonomy, an adventure. When you are young and get that sort of opportunity, you take it rather than thinking about the details or consequences.”","There were no briefings on the kind of work that non-US citizens should avoid, or warnings about the legal risks. “CA was sloppy and didn’t care about its staff,” said the first employee.","Cambridge Analytica said that the company “adheres to FEC [Federal Election Commission] regulations” and that Nix had never been in charge of work on any US election campaigns.","“He has never had a strategic or operational role on any election campaigns undertaken in the US,” a spokesman said, adding that “all CA personnel in strategic roles were US nationals or green card holders and these strategic roles provided all direction to non-strategic personnel”.","The legal memo also warned Cambridge Analytica that it needed to carefully hide behind a firewall any work it did in a single state or election for a particular candidate and for any of the so-called super-PACs (political action committees) supporting the campaign.","These committees can spend unlimited funds but cannot coordinate with individual candidates.","Levy warned that the company would need “to separate working teams that are engaged in substantive work for two or more entities that are not permitted to coordinate their activities”.","The nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, which represents the public interest, has accused Cambridge Analytica over allegations of illegal coordination of this nature.","It has filed evidence with the FEC alleging that the super-PAC Make America Number 1 made illegal contributions to Trump’s campaign, “engaging in unlawful coordinated spending by using the common vendor Cambridge Analytica”.","Cambridge Analytica denied there had been any illegal coordination, saying it had a firewall policy in place, signed by all staff and strictly enforced.","“Where firewalls exist staff are physically separated; use separate databases and servers; and are prevented from communicating with each other,” a spokesman said.","“The accusations of the Campaign Legal Center are based on conjecture, tabloid stories, and hearsay that attempted to mischaracterise FEC filings where Cambridge Analytica publicly declared our non-coordinated work for different entities.”","Bannon, Mercer and Nix did not respond to requests for comment on the legal memo or their operating structure during the 2016 presidential election.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

But to get there he’ll have to battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who exploit and hijack groups to make money or sow chaos.","One week after the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, those searching on Facebook for information about the upcoming March for Our Lives were likely to be shown an active group with more than 50,000 members.","Called “March for Our Lives 2018 Official,” it appeared to be one of the best places to get details about the event and connect with others interested in gun control. But those who joined the group soon found themselves puzzled. The admins often posted pro-gun information and unrelated memes and mocked those who posted about gun control.","“I'm a retired federal law enforcement special agent. There is and never has been any reason for a civilian to have a high-capacity high velocity weapon,” posted one member on Feb. 20.","“Shutup fed and stop trying to spread your NWO BS,” was the top reply, which came from one of the group’s admins. (NWO is a reference to the “new world order” conspiracy theory.)","A few days later the group’s name was changed to “Kim Jong Un Fan Club,” and members continued to wonder what was going on.","The simple answer is they were being trolled. The more complicated one is that while Facebook groups may offer a positive experience for millions of people around the world, they have also become a global honeypot of spam, fake news, conspiracies, health misinformation, harassment, hacking, trolling, scams, and other threats to users, according to reporting by BuzzFeed News, findings from researchers, and the recent indictment of 13 Russians for their alleged efforts to interfere in the US election.","“This vision could backfire terribly: an increase in the weight of ‘groups’ means reinforcement of Facebook’s worst features — cognitive bubbles — where users are kept in silos fueled by a torrent of fake news and extremism,” wrote Frederic Filloux, coauthor of the influential weekly media commentary newsletter Monday Note.","“Propagandists and spammers need to amass an audience, and groups serve that up on a platter. There’s no need to run an ad campaign to find people receptive to your message if you can simply join relevant groups and start posting,” she said.","To her point, the recent indictment of the 13 Russians repeatedly cited Facebook groups as a focus of workers at the Internet Research Agency.","“By 2016, the size of many organization-controlled groups had grown to hundreds of thousands of online followers,” the indictment said.","One part of the Russian effort on Facebook left unmentioned in the Mueller indictment — and that has not previously been reported — is that Facebook’s group recommendation system encouraged fans of troll-run pages such as Blactivist and Heart of Texas to organize themselves into groups based on their shared affinity for a page. To this day there remain many groups with automatically generated names such as “Friends Who Like Blacktivist” or “Friends Who Like Heart of Texas.” These groups appear to be small and inactive, but the fact remains that Facebook prompted Americans to organize into fan groups of Russian troll pages.","There’s no question that groups offer value to many Facebook users. They keep friends and former classmates close, and played a key role in helping organize the West Virginia teachers’ strike. They are the basis for a thriving global community of buy, sell, and barter networks. Groups were used to raise money for victims of the Las Vegas shooting, and help provide support to, and prevent suicide among, US military personnel. Facebook groups can restrict membership by being designated “secret” or “closed,” and as a result people often share deeply personal information and experiences because they feel protected from the prying eyes of search engines and the public at large.","That’s the case for Female IN, a secret Facebook group that today boasts a membership of more than 1.5 million women around the world. It was created by Lola Omolola, a Nigerian-born journalist now living in Chicago. She started it after more than 250 schoolgirls were kidnapped by a terrorist group in Nigeria. Many of the women in the group live in, or are originally from, African countries. But Omolola said it has grown to include women from other parts of the world.","Secret groups like FIN are completely invisible to anyone who is not a member, and Facebook users can only join if they are invited by a current member. This is different from closed groups, which can be found via search, show up on user profiles, and enable anyone to request to be added to the group.","“We discuss everything from everyday day stuff like your children, your healthcare, and your individual interactions with people. We go from there to talking about domestic violence. People are sharing in real time what happens at their homes,” Omolola told BuzzFeed News in an interview facilitated by Facebook’s PR team. “Generally we are very actively and thoughtfully healing a population of women who are used to being silenced, and whose voices have never really historically mean that much.”","But even a group that Facebook itself points to as an example of the product’s value has to wage a battle against bad actors. Omolola and other FIN admins work constantly to keep men and spammers out of the group. They have to warn members about imposter FIN groups on Facebook that try to leverage her group’s success and brand among women. A post to the public FIN Facebook page from last fall warned women of a “FAKE FIN run by A MAN!!!”","“Some people try to use the [FIN] name to get a lot of people to their groups,” Omolola said. “We have contacted Facebook and Facebook knows about it, and are working on ways to protect us.”","Omolola says she working on trademarking the group’s name so she can ask Facebook can enforce her trademark and take imposter groups down faster. Right now, it’s mostly up to her and her members to go into fake FIN groups and warn people that it’s a scam.","Jennifer Dulski, the head of groups and community at Facebook, told BuzzFeed News that there is now a dedicated “integrity” team for groups, which includes people who specialize in security, product, machine learning, and content moderation. She pointed to new tools launched last year that help admins screen and easily remove members, and that lets admins clearly state the rules of a given group on its About page. (Omolola said these new features are all big time savers.)","“There is some negative content and behavior happening on Facebook, including in groups, and we take that really seriously,” Dulski said.","She emphasized that the the experience for most users is positive.","“It’s amazing to see what is actually happening in Facebook groups, and the vast majority of of activity and content in these groups is not only positive but also meaningful for the people involved in them.”","DiResta sees a parallel, suggesting groups are at the same stage pages and the News Feed were prior to Facebook’s 2016 wake-up call about fake news: rife with manipulation and lacking proper oversight.","“We need to avoid a repeat of the kind of persuasive manipulation we saw on pages, so Facebook needs to be pay attention to these issues as they continue to increase their emphasis on groups,” DiResta said.","That emphasis on groups is now a cornerstone of Zuckerberg’s vision for the company and product. Last summer he announced an ambitious goal to drastically increase the number of Facebook users in “meaningful” groups from 100 to 1 billion.","“If we can do this, it will not only turn around the whole decline in community membership we've seen for decades, it will start to strengthen our social fabric and bring the world closer together,” he said in a speech at Facebook’s first Community Summit last summer.","But to get to a billion, Facebook will have to acknowledge and battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who constantly exploit, take over, and buy and sell groups in order to make money or sow chaos. It will also have to confront the fact that its own recommendation engine at times pushes users into conspiracy theorist groups, or into those geared toward trolling, harassment, or illicit online activity.","The global exploitation of groups","As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, members of a Facebook group called Republicans Suck suddenly experienced an influx of new members who spammed the group with links to questionable stories on websites they’d never heard of.","Bobby Ison, a Kentucky man who was member of the group, told BuzzFeed News that he noticed the administrators and moderators of the group began to change and “some of them were obvious foreign accounts. Eastern European countries. Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia.”","Ison said he and others learned that the Facebook account of one of the group’s original admins had been hacked. With control of the admin’s Facebook profile, the hackers were then able to add whoever they wanted as admins, and remove the group’s original leaders.","“When they got his [account], they booted the other admins, and moved more of theirs in,” Ison said. “It was rather sad to witness.” (The admin whose account Ison said was hacked did not respond to inquiries from BuzzFeed News.)","Eventually, former admins and members fled to start a new, closed group called","“As some of you know, the old REPUBLICANS SUCK has been hacked and taken over by hackers and trolls, which is something that is happening in several groups,” reads the pinned message for the group from one of its administrators.","Ison said the old group’s new overseas admins stepped up their spamming efforts in order to drive traffic from the group to their sites, presumably so they could earn ad revenue.","“It turned into a horrible page after they finally took over. Posting some of the most outlandish stories I've seen,” he said.","BuzzFeed News spoke via Facebook Messenger with one of the profiles currently listed as an admin of the group. That account has previously posted online about a Ford van for sale in Macedonia and written posts in Macedonian. Many of the account’s earliest posts in groups were for online moneymaking schemes. The person running the account said they were only added as an admin of the group two months earlier and didn't know anything about the group takeover last year.","“For the first time I hear from you that this group is stolen,” they wrote. They said they are not profiting in any way from the group. (BuzzFeed News could not confirm whether the profile’s name is linked to a real person.)","“We have no interest, we have no profit, we do not do with advertisements,” they said, and offered to make a BuzzFeed News reporter an admin of the group as a sign of goodwill.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups.\"","BuzzFeed News previously documented how political Facebook groups were exploited to spread political fake news to Americans during the 2016 election and beyond. An article published on Election Day revealed that Macedonian spammers used fake profiles to spam Trump and Bernie Sanders groups to generate engagement for their often false pro-Trump stories.","The tactic of spamming groups is by no means restricted to US politics or those targeting US audiences.","Rappler, an independent news website in the Philippines, last month published a story about a seemingly fake Facebook profile that spammed groups with links to websites that carried positive news about President Rodrigo Duterte. At one point the profile took over a fan group for a South Korean actor and changed its name to “President Duterte Supporters.”","Rappler found that the account posted hundreds of links to pro-Duterte news in Facebook groups since last summer. “She had also posted 307 times in various groups linking to a website called ‘Philippine Republic News’ which carries fake stories such as Oprah's support for President Duterte,” the story said.","A report on troll farms and fake news in the Philippines by two researchers included a case study showing that paid trolls tasked with helping win an election “came up with fake profiles and populated a Facebook group dedicated to the city they were trying to win.”","Facebook groups are also an engine of misinformation in Myanmar. Thura, a worker with a Myanmar social media research organisation, told BuzzFeed News by email that “Facebook groups are being used widely to spread hatred.” (BuzzFeed News agreed to conceal his identity due to security and safety concerns related to the work he does in Myanmar.)","Thura said people are using groups to spread hate and misinformation because they’re aware that less of the content posted to pages will reach the News Feed. So they focus on groups as a cheaper and more reliable way to reach people.","“Since Facebook pages do not normally go into News Feed unless they pay ads, groups are a good way to raise visibility of some of the fake news,” Thura wrote. “Groups are also a good strategy for [generating] engagement for a post from a page, meaning once a page posts a content, their network share them in several different groups.”","Spamming fake stories into groups is also the preferred tactic of American fake news publishers. Jestin Coler is a California man who ran more than a dozen early fake news sites such as National Report starting in 2013. He exited the fake news game last year and now says he’s focused on trying to use his experience to help battle online misinformation. Coler told BuzzFeed News that spamming groups was, and continues to be, a key traffic strategy for fake stories — and it’s still not being dealt with by Facebook.","“Joining Facebook groups that are related to the content being promoted, then spamming links throughout those groups using various aliases, is quite effective,” he said. “Members of the group then essentially become ‘bots’ and often share content to their network (outside of the group) creating a more organic-looking campaign.”","Coler said it was standard practice to identify specific Facebook groups related to the topic of a fake story and then join them all at once to enable link spamming.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups,” he said.","His lack of knowledge of American pop culture also caused him to share the link in a group dedicated to the TV show It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He apparently thought it was a group focused on the city. (He did not reply to requests for comment at the time.) One town in Kosovo is also home to a network of groups that spread fake news to Americans, according to a recent report by Media Matters.","Facebook’s intention to give even more visibility to group content in the News Feed will now make this tactic even more appealing. It could also result in more takeovers of groups. There’s evidence this is already happening.","Two weeks after Facebook announced its latest News Feed algorithm changes, former admins and members of “Mystic Fire Native Heart,” a group with tens of thousands of members, began posting to warn that it had been taken over by hackers from Eastern Europe.","Keyword squatting and targeted harassment","Another tactic that could become more frequent with the elevation of groups by Facebook is what researcher Joan Donovan calls “keyword squatting.” The group that changed its name to “March for Our Lives 2018 Official” in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is a perfect example. That group has over time gained tens of thousands of members thanks to the admins changing its title to different topical names that are likely to attract new members.","When Stephen Hawking died last week the group changed its name to “RIP STEPHEN HAWKING 2018” and as a result showed up as a top three result in a groups search for “stephen hawking.”","Facebook","“This is a feature that they have learned to leverage and you can imagine if they have learned to do it there are hundreds if not thousands of other groups changing the keyword weekly in order to get attention,” said Donovan, who leads the media manipulation project for the research institute Data & Society. (Facebook declined to comment on that group’s tactics.)","Thura said keyword squatting is a common tactic in Myanmar, too. People will start a Facebook group with a topic that has broad appeal and is not connected to news. Then, once it’s gained enough members, the admins switch its name and start sharing false stories.","“The strategy they used often is that they start with a different name and then once they have a large amount of users, they change it to a different name such as ‘Let’s Share News’ group,” Thura said.","Dulski, who oversees groups at Facebook, said the company has invested in new tools to enable group members to report content that may violate the terms of service, or a group’s specific rules.","“One is tool for members to report posts that might be violating the rules, and they can report this to the admins of the group and to Facebook,” she said. “This allows admins to quickly and easily review and keep bad content from appearing.”","In cases of hate speech or offensive content, Dilski said Facebook uses machine learning to automatically flag posts that may be violating the terms of service, regardless of whether people report it or not.","Thura said he and other have found it’s often pointless to flag content or complain to group admins about fake news since they’re often the ones spreading it.","There are in fact groups that exist solely to engage in activities that violate Facebook’s terms of service. One group, Republic of Kekistan, amassed more than 30,000 members before being removed by Facebook earlier this year. BuzzFeed News joined the group last year and watched as members coordinated online harassment campaigns, most of which were targeted at trans women and left-leaning Facebook pages. The group was also home to hate speech, such as a post where one member posted a photo of a handgun and asked, \"What kind of Muslim repellant do y'all carry?\"","Facebook","The process for planning raids was simple: One group member shared a link to a piece of content they didn’t agree with and added the word “raid” to signal like-minded members to flood the comments of the content in question with nasty, often hate-filled messages and other types of trolling. Some calls for raids went unnoticed by the rest of the group, but others funneled dozens of hateful comments to unsuspecting victims.","At one point, a post in the group asked members to “raid the comments” of a fundraising post for the family of Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed during the Charlottesville demonstrations last year. Another post encouraged members to post laughing reactions to a Facebook post about a trans teen who committed suicide (The group’s description page at one point warned members, “No raid posts allowed. The safety of the nation must be guarded against retaliatory attacks.” But it appeared that policy was enforced loosely, if at all.)","BuzzFeed News","Planning coordinated online attacks is against Facebook policy, but members of Republic of Kekistan seemingly stayed under Facebook’s radar and went unpunished for months. Sophie Labelle, a cartoonist from Montreal and a trans woman, was targeted last May. Labelle writes a web comic called Assigned Male and is the author of several comic books about being trans. Labelle told BuzzFeed News she’s used to the online harassment that comes with being a trans public figure, but this was an extreme case.","Trolls posted her home address online and she had to move. Labelle said her roommate, who’s also trans, felt threatened too. The trolls also targeted a bookstore hosting her launch and as a result it was canceled. (That raid worked out in Labelle's favor: the added attention helped her book sell out its first printing.)","“I feel pretty powerless. It’s kind of a given that when you show support to me it makes you a target,” she said.","Labelle said there are conspiracy theories about her online and even her readers are sometimes targeted if they leave a comment on one of her social media posts.","Labelle suspects Republic of Kekistan was behind the May harassment, but she does not know for sure. As payback, her supporters decided to band together to coordinate mass-reporting of the Facebook group for violating the platform’s terms of service, and Facebook eventually shut it down temporarily that same month. The group reemerged at some point after the ban and was active again as recently as January, according to an online archive. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about when and why Republic of Kekistan was taken offline.","A marketplace of black hat groups services","Groups have become attractive enough for both legitimate and bad actors that there’s now a flourishing online marketplace of apps and services related to exploiting them.","There are multiple software apps that can automate posting links in groups and also automate the process of joining groups and inviting other profiles into them. For a small fee, you can buy new members to make your group seem more popular than it is, pay to spam a link of your choosing in groups with large numbers of members to try to drive traffic, or hire someone to go into a group and capture the email addresses of members in order to enable further spamming and targeting.","All of the aforementioned services violate Facebook’s terms of service, but they are easily found with a simple online search, or by going to a freelancing site such as Fiverr. Many of these services are offered by people based in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India.","“Looking for a Facebook promotion expert to help you post and promote your products, services to millions of real and active Facebook group members ???” read one recent Fiverr ad. “Search no more.I am here to give you full expert service that will promote your ads or links to about 40 million real and active Facebook group members.”","To learn how these providers add hundreds or thousands of members to groups, BuzzFeed News purchased a total of 6,000 members for three groups it set up. One person on Fiverr charged $6 to provide 5,000 members for a group. BuzzFeed News then purchased two more sets of 500 members from different providers that were found by simply searching Google for “buy facebook group members.”","People all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","One company charged $25 to add 500 members that were located in the US or UK. Another charged just $6 for 500 members that were not accounts specifically based in those two countries. In each case the process was the same: After the order was placed BuzzFeed News was contacted by email or Facebook and told to make a specific Facebook profile an administrator of the group. Once done, the administrator began quickly adding other Facebook accounts to the group. Suddenly these newly created groups appeared more popular than they were, and were likely to show up higher in search results on Facebook.","The profiles added to the groups appeared to belong to real people, though a sampling of some of them found they were inactive for a year or two. The orders that did not specify US and UK profiles saw accounts added primarily from Bangladesh and India.","A man in Pakistan who helped fulfil one of the orders told BuzzFeed News in a Facebook Messenger chat that he could easily add large numbers of profiles to any group in a short amount of time.","“I do even 500,000 members in single group easily,” he said.","He said the accounts he adds to a group belong to real people. The key is that he controls many Facebook accounts that he uses to friend real people. Once two accounts are friends, Facebook easily allows one profile to add the other into a public group without requiring their permission. (In the case of closed and secret groups, the invited profile must accept the request.)","The result is that people all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","The man told BuzzFeed News he uses a computer programming script to automatically add members in batches of 500 to 700. If he does more than that at a time he risks being banned by Facebook. But that limit appears to do little to deter those selling group members. (Once he saw that the BuzzFeed News reporter had a verified Facebook profile he offered to pay to get profiles he controls verified.)","Facebook","Facebook groups themselves are also places to purchase black-hat online marketing services. BuzzFeed News joined a group dedicated to Google’s AdSense advertising network and saw a post from an admin that listed his services. One item for sale? Facebook groups.","“I have facebook trade and sell groups for sale 20k to 40k members,” he wrote.","Radicalization by the recommendation engine","DiResta, the security researcher, first saw the risks of groups in 2015 while researching health conspiracy content and communities on social networks. She joined anti-vaccine parenting groups on Facebook and watched as well-meaning parents became increasingly radicalized in their views of Western medicine. She also saw false and misleading links spread quickly within groups.","DiResta also documented how group members coordinated the sharing of specific links on Twitter and other platforms to create the impression of an outpouring of support for a specific point of view. “They didn’t have bots but they were effectively replicating the function of bots,” DiResta said. “They were using these groups to coordinate and spread these messages.”","Facebook’s recommendation system also began its own process of algorithmic radicalization. DiResta noticed that as her account became more involved in anti-vax groups Facebook shifted the kind of groups it recommended to her. She was soon being shown groups about chemtrails, fluoride conspiracies, and flat Earth. As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, Facebook suggested she join groups dedicated to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. DiResta calls it “radicalization via the recommendation engine.”","She provided two screenshots to BuzzFeed News, both taken in December 2016, that show Pizzagate group recommendations for her profile. The largest group being pitched had more than 12,000 members at the time.","Similarly, after BuzzFeed News joined the group dedicated to gaming and cheating AdSense, Facebook’s recommendation engine surfaced a list of groups dedicated to the same topics, as if to say, “We see you enjoy ad and click fraud. Try these groups to learn more.”","Facebook also uses data about groups membership to recommend new friends. At the same time that the groups recommendation engine can push people further to the fringe, Facebook will suggest new friends who reinforce these perspectives.","Another concern for DiResta is how secret groups are used to further the radicalization process. When she was researching the anti-vax community she found it was easy to join open and closed groups. But she soon discovered that people used secret groups to exchange the most sensitive information and even engage in illegal activity.","“People would go into a group and say, ‘Hey, I need to get a medical exemption [for vaccines] for my kid’ and someone would say, ‘Hang on, I’ll DM you.’ Then gradually they recruit you into a secret group,” she said. “There was a whole underground network of information sharing around which doctors to go to in order to get fraudulent medical exemptions.”","DiResta said Facebook must find a way to strike a balance between letting people search for and talk about the topics they want without actively radicalizing or polarizing them.","“People have a right to search for Pizzagate and join Pizzagate groups, yes,” she said. “But for Facebook to be continuously, proactively surfacing these types of groups to people, that I think is where the ethics of the recommender system is insufficiently developed right now.”","“At a minimum, it needs to be studying how often people respond to these suggestions, and how groups may be impacting polarization,” she said. “Only Facebook has this data.”","Tellingly, even those who are happily engaging in conspiracy theory groups on Facebook also express frustration with how the product is being exploited. Last month a member of the PizzagateUncompromised group (7,500 members) posted a warning.","Facebook","“The groups Exposing the Rothschilds and Pizzagate Exposed were hijacked,” he wrote.","It happened the same way that “Republicans Suck” and “Mystic Fire Native Heart” were taken over.","“It happens in a lot of groups,” replied one person. “Time to look for some good alternatives to FB imo.” ●","Craig Silverman is a media editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in Toronto."],"isopubdate":""}

We hope you understand, and consider subscribing for unlimited online access.","How Obama’s Team Used Big Data to Rally Voters","How President Obama’s campaign used big data to rally individual voters.","The Obama 2012 campaign used data analytics and the experimental method to assemble a winning coalition vote by vote. In doing so, it overturned the long dominance of TV advertising in U.S. politics and created something new in the world: a national campaign run like a local ward election, where the interests of individual voters were known and addressed.","Two years after Barack Obama’s election as president, Democrats suffered their worst defeat in decades. The congressional majorities that had given Obama his legislative successes, reforming the health-insurance and financial markets, were swept away in the midterm elections; control of the House flipped and the Democrats’ lead in the Senate shrank to an ungovernably slim margin. Pundits struggled to explain the rise of the Tea Party. Voters’ disappointment with the Obama agenda was evident as independents broke right and Democrats stayed home. In 2010, the Democratic National Committee failed its first test of the Obama era: it had not kept the Obama coalition together.","But for Democrats, there was bleak consolation in all this: Dan Wagner had seen it coming. When Wagner was hired as the DNC’s targeting director, in January of 2009, he became responsible for collecting voter information and analyzing it to help the committee approach individual voters by direct mail and phone. But he appreciated that the raw material he was feeding into his statistical models amounted to a series of surveys on voters’ attitudes and preferences. He asked the DNC’s technology department to develop software that could turn that information into tables, and he called the result Survey Manager.","That fall, when a special election was held to fill an open congressional seat in upstate New York, Wagner successfully predicted the final margin within 150 votes—well before Election Day. Months later, pollsters projected that Martha Coakley was certain to win another special election, to fill the Massachusetts Senate seat left empty by the death of Ted Kennedy. But Wagner’s Survey Manager correctly predicted that the Republican Scott Brown was likely to prevail in the strongly Democratic state. “It’s one thing to be right when you’re going to win,” says Jeremy Bird, who served as national deputy director of Organizing for America, the Obama campaign in abeyance, housed at the DNC. “It’s another thing to be right when you’re going to lose.”","It is yet another thing to be right five months before you’re going to lose. As the 2010 midterms approached, Wagner built statistical models for selected Senate races and 74 congressional districts. Starting in June, he began predicting the elections’ outcomes, forecasting the margins of victory with what turned out to be improbable accuracy. But he hadn’t gotten there with traditional polls. He had counted votes one by one. His first clue that the party was in trouble came from thousands of individual survey calls matched to rich statistical profiles in the DNC’s databases. Core Democratic voters were telling the DNC’s callers that they were much less likely to vote than statistical probability suggested. Wagner could also calculate how much the Democrats’ mobilization programs would do to increase turnout among supporters, and in most races he knew it wouldn’t be enough to cover the gap revealing itself in Survey Manager’s tables.","His congressional predictions were off by an average of only 2.5 percent. “That was a proof point for a lot of people who don’t understand the math behind it but understand the value of what that math produces,” says Mitch Stewart, Organizing for America’s director. “Once that first special [election] happened, his word was the gold standard at the DNC.”","The significance of Wagner’s achievement went far beyond his ability to declare winners months before Election Day. His approach amounted to a decisive break with 20th-century tools for tracking public opinion, which revolved around quarantining small samples that could be treated as representative of the whole. Wagner had emerged from a cadre of analysts who thought of voters as individuals and worked to aggregate projections about their opinions and behavior until they revealed a composite picture of everyone. His techniques marked the fulfillment of a new way of thinking, a decade in the making, in which voters were no longer trapped in old political geographies or tethered to traditional demographic categories, such as age or gender, depending on which attributes pollsters asked about or how consumer marketers classified them for commercial purposes. Instead, the electorate could be seen as a collection of individual citizens who could each be measured and assessed on their own terms. Now it was up to a candidate who wanted to lead those people to build a campaign that would interact with them the same way.","Dan Wagner, the chief analytics officer for Obama 2012, led the campaign’s “Cave” of data scientists.","After the voters returned Obama to office for a second term, his campaign became celebrated for its use of technology—much of it developed by an unusual team of coders and engineers—that redefined how individuals could use the Web, social media, and smartphones to participate in the political process. A mobile app allowed a canvasser to download and return walk sheets without ever entering a campaign office; a Web platform called Dashboard gamified volunteer activity by ranking the most active supporters; and “targeted sharing” protocols mined an Obama backer’s Facebook network in search of friends the campaign wanted to register, mobilize, or persuade.","But underneath all that were scores describing particular voters: a new political currency that predicted the behavior of individual humans. The campaign didn’t just know who you were; it knew exactly how it could turn you into the type of person it wanted you to be.","The Scores","Four years earlier, Dan Wagner had been working at a Chicago economic consultancy, using forecasting skills developed studying econometrics at the University of Chicago, when he fell for Barack Obama and decided he wanted to work on his home-state senator’s 2008 presidential campaign. Wagner, then 24, was soon in Des Moines, handling data entry for the state voter file that guided Obama to his crucial victory in the Iowa caucuses. He bounced from state to state through the long primary calendar, growing familiar with voter data and the ways of using statistical models to intelligently sort the electorate. For the general election, he was named lead targeter for the Great Lakes/Ohio River Valley region, the most intense battleground in the country.","After Obama’s victory, many of his top advisors decamped to Washington to make preparations for governing. Wagner was told to stay behind and serve on a post-election task force that would review a campaign that had looked, to the outside world, technically flawless.","In the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s targeters had assigned every voter in the country a pair of scores based on the probability that the individual would perform two distinct actions that mattered to the campaign: casting a ballot and supporting Obama. These scores were derived from an unprecedented volume of ongoing survey work. For each battleground state every week, the campaign’s call centers conducted 5,000 to 10,000 so-called short-form interviews that quickly gauged a voter’s preferences, and 1,000 interviews in a long-form version that was more like a traditional poll. To derive individual-level predictions, algorithms trawled for patterns between these opinions and the data points the campaign had assembled for every voter—as many as one thousand variables each, drawn from voter registration records, consumer data warehouses, and past campaign contacts.","This innovation was most valued in the field. There, an almost perfect cycle of microtargeting models directed volunteers to scripted conversations with specific voters at the door or over the phone. Each of those interactions produced data that streamed back into Obama’s servers to refine the models pointing volunteers toward the next door worth a knock. The efficiency and scale of that process put the Democrats well ahead when it came to profiling voters. John McCain’s campaign had, in most states, run its statistical model just once, assigning each voter to one of its microtargeting segments in the summer. McCain’s advisors were unable to recalculate the probability that those voters would support their candidate as the dynamics of the race changed. Obama’s scores, on the other hand, adjusted weekly, responding to new events like Sarah Palin’s vice-presidential nomination or the collapse of Lehman Brothers.","Within the campaign, however, the Obama data operations were understood to have shortcomings. As was typical in political information infrastructure, knowledge about people was stored separately from data about the campaign’s interactions with them, mostly because the databases built for those purposes had been developed by different consultants who had no interest in making their systems work together.","But the task force knew the next campaign wasn’t stuck with that situation. Obama would run his final race not as an insurgent against a party establishment, but as the establishment itself. For four years, the task force members knew, their team would control the Democratic Party’s apparatus. Their demands, not the offerings of consultants and vendors, would shape the marketplace. Their report recommended developing a “constituent relationship management system” that would allow staff across the campaign to look up individuals not just as voters or volunteers or donors or website users but as citizens in full. “We realized there was a problem with how our data and infrastructure interacted with the rest of the campaign, and we ought to be able to offer it to all parts of the campaign,” says Chris Wegrzyn, a database applications developer who served on the task force.","Wegrzyn became the DNC’s lead targeting developer and oversaw a series of costly acquisitions, all intended to free the party from the traditional dependence on outside vendors. The committee installed a Siemens Enterprise System phone-dialing unit that could put out 1.2 million calls a day to survey voters’ opinions. Later, party leaders signed off on a $280,000 license to use Vertica software from Hewlett-Packard that allowed their servers to access not only the party’s 180-million-person voter file but all the data about volunteers, donors, and those who had interacted with Obama online.","Many of those who went to Washington after the 2008 election in order to further the president’s political agenda returned to Chicago in the spring of 2011 to work on his reëlection. The chastening losses they had experienced in Washington separated them from those who had known only the ecstasies of 2008. “People who did ‘08, but didn’t do ‘10, and came back in ‘11 or ‘12—they had the hardest culture clash,” says Jeremy Bird, who became national field director on the reëlection campaign. But those who went to Washington and returned to Chicago developed a particular appreciation for Wagner’s methods of working with the electorate at an atomic level. It was a way of thinking that perfectly aligned with their ­simple theory of what it would take to win the president reëlection: get everyone who had voted for him in 2008 to do it again. At the same time, they knew they would need to succeed at registering and mobilizing new voters, especially in some of the fastest-growing demographic categories, to make up for any 2008 voters who did defect.","Obama’s campaign began the election year confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House. They may have cast those votes by secret ballot, but Obama’s analysts could look at the Democrats’ vote totals in each precinct and identify the people most likely to have backed him. Pundits talked in the abstract about reassembling Obama’s 2008 coalition. But within the campaign, the goal was literal. They would reassemble the coalition, one by one, through personal contacts.","The Experiments","When Jim Messina arrived in Chicago as Obama’s newly minted campaign manager in January of 2011, he imposed a mandate on his recruits: they were to make decisions based on measurable data. But that didn’t mean quite what it had four years before. The 2008 campaign had been “data-driven,” as people liked to say. This reflected a principled imperative to challenge the political establishment with an empirical approach to electioneering, and it was greatly influenced by David Plouffe, the 2008 campaign manager, who loved metrics, spreadsheets, and performance reports. Plouffe wanted to know: How many of a field office’s volunteer shifts had been filled last weekend? How much money did that ad campaign bring in?","But for all its reliance on data, the 2008 Obama campaign had remained insulated from the most important methodological innovation in 21st-century politics. In 1998, Yale professors Don Green and Alan Gerber conducted the first randomized controlled trial in modern political science, assigning New Haven voters to receive nonpartisan election reminders by mail, phone, or in-person visit from a canvasser and measuring which group saw the greatest increase in turnout. The subsequent wave of field experiments by Green, Gerber, and their followers focused on mobilization, testing competing modes of contact and get-out-the-vote language to see which were most successful.","The first Obama campaign used the findings of such tests to tweak call scripts and canvassing protocols, but it never fully embraced the experimental revolution itself. After Dan Wagner moved to the DNC, the party decided it would start conducting its own experiments. He hoped the committee could become “a driver of research for the Democratic Party.”","To that end, he hired the Analyst Institute, a Washington-based consortium founded under the AFL-CIO’s leadership in 2006 to coördinate field research projects across the electioneering left and distribute the findings among allies. Much of the experimental world’s research had focused on voter registration, because that was easy to measure. The breakthrough was that registration no longer had to be approached passively; organizers did not have to simply wait for the unenrolled to emerge from anonymity, sign a form, and, they hoped, vote. New techniques made it possible to intelligently profile nonvoters: commercial data warehouses sold lists of all voting-age adults, and comparing those lists with registration rolls revealed eligible candidates, each attached to a home address to which an application could be mailed. Applying microtargeting models identified which nonregistrants were most likely to be Democrats and which ones Republicans.","The Obama campaign embedded social scientists from the Analyst Institute among its staff. Party officials knew that adding new Democratic voters to the registration rolls was a crucial element in their strategy for 2012. But already the campaign had ambitions beyond merely modifying nonparticipating citizens’ behavior through registration and mobilization. It wanted to take on the most vexing problem in politics: changing voters’ minds.","The expansion of individual-level data had made possible the kind of testing that could help do that. Experimenters had typically calculated the average effect of their interventions across the entire population. But as campaigns developed deep portraits of the voters in their databases, it became possible to measure the attributes of the people who were actually moved by an experiment’s impact. A series of tests in 2006 by the women’s group Emily’s List had illustrated the potential of conducting controlled trials with microtargeting databases. When the group sent direct mail in favor of Democratic gubernatorial candidates, it barely budged those whose scores placed them in the middle of the partisan spectrum; it had a far greater impact upon those who had been profiled as soft (or nonideological) Republicans.","That test, and others that followed, demonstrated the limitations of traditional targeting. Such techniques rested on a series of long-standing assumptions—for instance, that middle-of-the-roaders were the most persuadable and that infrequent voters were the likeliest to be captured in a get-out-the-vote drive. But the experiments introduced new uncertainty. People who were identified as having a 50 percent likelihood of voting for a Democrat might in fact be torn between the two parties, or they might look like centrists only because no data attached to their records pushed a partisan prediction in one direction or another. “The scores in the middle are the people we know less about,” says Chris Wyant, a 2008 field organizer who became the campaign’s general election director in Ohio four years later. “The extent to which we were guessing about persuasion was not lost on any of us.”","One way the campaign sought to identify the ripest targets was through a series of what the Analyst Institute called “experiment-informed programs,” or EIPs, designed to measure how effective different types of messages were at moving public opinion.","The traditional way of doing this had been to audition themes and language in focus groups and then test the winning material in polls to see which categories of voters responded positively to each approach. Any insights were distorted by the artificial settings and by the tiny samples of demographic subgroups in traditional polls. “You’re making significant resource decisions based on 160 people?” asks Mitch Stewart, director of the Democratic campaign group Organizing for America. “Isn’t that nuts? And people have been doing that for decades!”","An experimental program would use those steps to develop a range of prospective messages that could be subjected to empirical testing in the real world. Experimenters would randomly assign voters to receive varied sequences of direct mail—four pieces on the same policy theme, each making a slightly different case for Obama—and then use ongoing survey calls to isolate the attributes of those whose opinions changed as a result.","In March, the campaign used this technique to test various ways of promoting the administration’s health-care policies. One series of mailers described Obama’s regulatory reforms; another advised voters that they were now entitled to free regular check-ups and ought to schedule one. The experiment revealed how much voter response differed by age, especially among women. Older women thought more highly of the policies when they received reminders about preventive care; younger women liked them more when they were told about contraceptive coverage and new rules that prohibited insurance companies from charging women more.","When Paul Ryan was named to the Republican ticket in August, Obama’s advisors rushed out an EIP that compared different lines of attack about Medicare. The results were surprising. “The electorate [had seemed] very inelastic,” says Terry Walsh, who coördinated the campaign’s polling and paid-media spending. “In fact, when we did the Medicare EIPs, we got positive movement that was very heartening, because it was at a time when we were not seeing a lot of movement in the electorate.” But that movement came from quarters where a traditional campaign would never have gone hunting for minds it could change. The Obama team found that voters between 45 and 65 were more likely to change their views about the candidates after hearing Obama’s Medicare arguments than those over 65, who were currently eligible for the program.","A similar strategy of targeting an unexpected population emerged from a July EIP testing Obama’s messages aimed at women. The voters most responsive to the campaign’s arguments about equal-pay measures and women’s health, it found, were those whose likelihood of supporting the president was scored at merely 20 and 40 percent. Those scores suggested that they probably shared Republican attitudes; but here was one thing that could pull them to Obama. As a result, when Obama unveiled a direct-mail track addressing only women’s issues, it wasn’t to shore up interest among core parts of the Democratic coalition, but to reach over for conservatives who were at odds with their party on gender concerns. “The whole goal of the women’s track was to pick off votes for Romney,” says Walsh. “We were able to persuade people who fell low on candidate support scores if we gave them a specific message.”","At the same time, Obama’s campaign was pursuing a second, even more audacious adventure in persuasion: one-on-one interaction. Traditionally, campaigns have restricted their persuasion efforts to channels like mass media or direct mail, where they can control presentation, language, and targeting. Sending volunteers to persuade voters would mean forcing them to interact with opponents, or with voters who were undecided because they were alienated from politics on delicate issues like abortion. Campaigns have typically resisted relinquishing control of ground-level interactions with voters to risk such potentially combustible situations; they felt they didn’t know enough about their supporters or volunteers. “You can have a negative impact,” says Jeremy Bird, who served as national deputy director of Organizing for America. “You can hurt your candidate.”","In February, however, Obama volunteers attempted 500,000 conversations with the goal of winning new supporters. Voters who’d been randomly selected from a group identified as persuadable were polled after a phone conversation that began with a volunteer reading from a script. “We definitely find certain people moved more than other people,” says Bird. Analysts identified their attributes and made them the core of a persuasion model that predicted, on a scale of 0 to 10, the likelihood that a voter could be pulled in Obama’s direction after a single volunteer interaction. The experiment also taught Obama’s field department about its volunteers. Those in California, which had always had an exceptionally mature volunteer organization for a non-­battleground state, turned out to be especially persuasive: voters called by Californians, no matter what state they were in themselves, were more likely to become Obama supporters.","Alex Lundry created Mitt Romney’s data science unit. It was less than one-tenth the size of Obama’s analytics team.","With these findings in hand, Obama’s strategists grew confident that they were no longer restricted to advertising as a channel for persuasion. They began sending trained volunteers to knock on doors or make phone calls with the objective of changing minds.","That dramatic shift in the culture of electioneering was felt on the streets, but it was possible only because of advances in analytics. Chris Wegrzyn, a database applications developer, developed a program code-named Airwolf that matched county and state lists of people who had requested mail ballots with the campaign’s list of e-mail addresses. Likely Obama supporters would get regular reminders from their local field organizers, asking them to return their ballots, and, once they had, a message thanking them and proposing other ways to be involved in the campaign. The local organizer would receive daily lists of the voters on his or her turf who had outstanding ballots so that the campaign could follow up with personal contact by phone or at the doorstep. “It is a fundamental way of tying together the online and offline worlds,” says Wagner.","Wagner, however, was turning his attention beyond the field. By June of 2011, he was chief analytics officer for the campaign and had begun making the rounds of the other units at headquarters, from fund-raising to communications, offering to help “solve their problems with data.” He imagined the analytics department—now a 54-person staff, housed in a windowless office known as the Cave—as an “in-house consultancy” with other parts of the campaign as its clients. “There’s a process of helping people learn about the tools so they can be a participant in the process,” he says. “We essentially built products for each of those various departments that were paired up with a massive database we had.”","The Flow","As job notices seeking specialists in text analytics, computational advertising, and online experiments came out of the incumbent’s campaign, Mitt Romney’s advisors at the Republicans’ headquarters in Boston’s North End watched with a combination of awe and perplexity. Throughout the primaries, Romney had appeared to be the only Republican running a 21st-century campaign, methodically banking early votes in states like Florida and Ohio before his disorganized opponents could establish operations there.","But the Republican winner’s relative sophistication in the primaries belied a poverty of expertise compared with the Obama campaign. Since his first campaign for governor of Massachusetts, in 2002, Romney had relied upon ­TargetPoint Consulting, a Virginia firm that was then a pioneer in linking information from consumer data warehouses to voter registration records and using it to develop individual-level predictive models. It was TargetPoint’s CEO, Alexander Gage, who had coined the term “microtargeting” to describe the process, which he modeled on the corporate world’s approach to customer relationship management.","Such techniques had offered George W. Bush’s reëlection campaign a significant edge in targeting, but Republicans had done little to institutionalize that advantage in the years since. By 2006, Democrats had not only matched Republicans in adopting commercial marketing techniques; they had moved ahead by integrating methods developed in the social sciences.","Romney’s advisors knew that Obama was building innovative internal data analytics departments, but they didn’t feel a need to match those activities. “I don’t think we thought, relative to the marketplace, we could be the best at data in-house all the time,” Romney’s digital director, Zac Moffatt, said in July. “Our idea is to find the best firms to work with us.” As a result, Romney remained dependent on TargetPoint to develop voter segments, often just once, and then deliver them to the campaign’s databases. That was the structure Obama had abandoned after winning the nomination in 2008.","In May a TargetPoint vice president, Alex Lundry, took leave from his post at the firm to assemble a data science unit within Romney’s headquarters. To round out his team, Lundry brought in Tom Wood, a University of Chicago postdoctoral student in political science, and Brent McGoldrick, a veteran of Bush’s 2004 campaign who had left politics for the consulting firm Financial Dynamics (later FTI Consulting), where he helped financial-services, health-care, and energy companies communicate better. But Romney’s data science team was less than one-tenth the size of Obama’s analytics department. Without a large in-house staff to handle the massive national data sets that made it possible to test and track citizens, Romney’s data scientists never tried to deepen their understanding of individual behavior. Instead, they fixated on trying to unlock one big, persistent mystery, which Lundry framed this way: “How can we get a sense of whether this advertising is working?”","“You usually get GRPs and tracking polls,” he says, referring to the gross ratings points that are the basic unit of measuring television buys. “There’s a very large causal leap you have to make from one to the other.”","Lundry decided to focus on more manageable ways of measuring what he called the information flow. His team converted topics of political communication into discrete units they called “entities.” They initially classified 200 of them, including issues like the auto industry bailout, controversies like the one surrounding federal funding for the solar-power company Solyndra, and catchphrases like “the war on women.” When a new concept (such as Obama’s offhand remark, during a speech about our common dependence on infrastructure, that “you didn’t build that”) emerged as part of the election-year lexicon, the analysts added it to the list. They tracked each entity on the National Dialogue Monitor, TargetPoint’s system for measuring the frequency and tone with which certain topics are mentioned across all media. TargetPoint also integrated content collected from newspaper websites and closed-caption transcripts of broadcast programs. Lundry’s team aimed to examine how every entity fared over time in each of two categories: the informal sphere of social media, especially Twitter, and the journalistic product that campaigns call earned press coverage.","Ultimately, Lundry wanted to assess the impact that each type of public attention had on what mattered most to them: Romney’s position in the horse race. He turned to vector autoregression models, which equities traders use to isolate the influence of single variables on market movements. In this case, Lundry’s team looked for patterns in the relationship between the National Dialogue Monitor’s data and Romney’s numbers in Gallup’s daily tracking polls. By the end of July, they thought they had identified a three-step process they called “Wood’s Triangle.”","Within three or four days of a new entity’s entry into the conversation, either through paid ads or through the news cycle, it was possible to make a well-informed hypothesis about whether the topic was likely to win media attention by tracking whether it generated Twitter chatter. That informal conversation among political-class elites typically led to traditional print or broadcast press coverage one to two days later, and that, in turn, might have an impact on the horse race. “We saw this process over and over again,” says Lundry.","They began to think of ads as a “shock to the system”—a way to either introduce a new topic or restore focus on an area in which elite interest had faded. If an entity didn’t gain its own energy—as when the Republicans charged over the summer that the White House had waived the work requirements in the federal welfare rules—Lundry would propose a “re-shock to the system” with another ad on the subject five to seven days later. After 12 to 14 days, Lundry found, an entity had passed through the system and exhausted its ability to alter public opinion—so he would recommend to the campaign’s communications staff that they move on to something new.","Those insights offered campaign officials a theory of information flows, but they provided no guidance in how to allocate campaign resources in order to win the Electoral College. Assuming that Obama had superior ground-level data and analytics, Romney’s campaign tried to leverage its rivals’ strategy to shape its own; if Democrats thought a state or media market was competitive, maybe that was evidence that Republicans should think so too. “We were necessarily reactive, because we were putting together the plane as it took off,” Lundry says. “They had an enormous head start on us.”","Romney’s political department began holding regular meetings to look at where in the country the Obama campaign was focusing resources like ad dollars and the president’s time. The goal was to try to divine the calculations behind those decisions. It was, in essence, the way Microsoft’s Bing approached Google: trying to reverse-engineer the market leader’s code by studying the visible output. “We watch where the president goes,” Dan ­Centinello, the Romney deputy political director who oversaw the meetings, said over the summer.","Obama’s media-buying strategy proved particularly hard to decipher. In early September, as part of his standard review, Lundry noticed that the week after the Democratic convention, Obama had aired 68 ads in Dothan, Alabama, a town near the Florida border. Dothan was one of the country’s smallest media markets, and Alabama one of the safest Republican states. Even though the area was known to savvy ad buyers as one of the places where a media market crosses state lines, Dothan TV stations reached only about 9,000 Florida voters, and around 7,000 of them had voted for John McCain in 2008. “This is a hard-core Republican media market,” Lundry says. “It’s incredibly tiny. But they were advertising there.”","Romney’s advisors might have formed a theory about the broader media environment, but whatever was sending Obama hunting for a small pocket of votes was beyond their measurement. “We could tell,” says McGoldrick, “that there was something in the algorithms that was telling them what to run.”","The March","In the summer of 2011, Carol Davidsen received a message from Dan Wagner. Already the Obama campaign was known for its relentless e-mails beseeching supporters to give their money or time, but this one offered something that intrigued Davidsen: a job. Wagner had sorted the campaign’s list of donors, stretching back to 2008, to find those who described their occupation with terms like “data” and “analytics” and sent them all invitations to apply for work in his new analytics department.","Davidsen was working at Navic Networks, a Microsoft-owned company that wrote code for set-top cable boxes to create a record of a user’s DVR or tuner history, when she heeded Wagner’s call. One year before Election Day, she started work in the campaign’s technology department to serve as product manager for Narwhal. That was the code name, borrowed from a tusked whale, for an ambitious effort to match records from previously unconnected databases so that a user’s online interactions with the campaign could be synchronized. With Narwhal, e-mail blasts asking people to volunteer could take their past donation history into consideration, and the algorithms determining how much a supporter would be asked to contribute could be shaped by knowledge about his or her reaction to previous solicitations. This integration enriched a technique, common in website development, that Obama’s online fund-raising efforts had used to good effect in 2008: the A/B test, in which users are randomly directed to different versions of a thing and their responses are compared. Now analysts could leverage personal data to identify the attributes of those who responded, and use that knowledge to refine subsequent appeals. “You can cite people’s other types of engagement,” says ­Amelia ­Showalter, Obama’s director of digital analytics. “We discovered that there were a lot of things that built goodwill, like signing the president’s birthday card or getting a free bumper sticker, that led them to become more engaged with the campaign in other ways.”","If online communication had been the aspect of the 2008 campaign subjected to the most rigorous empirical examination—it’s easy to randomly assign e-mails in an A/B test and compare click-through rates or donation levels—mass-media strategy was among those that received the least. Television and radio ads had to be purchased by geographic zone, and the available data on who watches which channels or shows, collected by research firms like Nielsen and Scarborough, often included little more than viewer age and gender. That might be good enough to guide buys for Schick or Foot Locker, but it’s of limited value for advertisers looking to define audiences in political terms.","As campaign manager Jim Messina prepared to spend as much as half a billion dollars on mass media for Obama’s reëlection, he set out to reinvent the process for allocating resources across broadcast, cable, satellite, and online channels. “If you think about the universe of possible places for an advertiser, it’s almost infinite,” says Amy Gershkoff, who was hired as the campaign’s media-planning director on the strength of her successful negotiations, while at her firm Changing Targets in 2009, to link the information from cable systems to individual microtargeting profiles. “There are tens of millions of opportunities where a campaign can put its next dollar. You have all this great, robust voter data that doesn’t fit together with the media data. How you knit that together is a challenge.”","By the start of 2012, ­Wagner had deftly wrested command of media planning into his own department. As he expanded the scope of analytics, he defined his purview as “the study and practice of resource optimization for the purpose of improving programs and earning votes more efficiently.” That usually meant calculating, for any campaign activity, the number of votes gained through a given amount of contact at a given cost.","But when it came to buying media, such calculations had been simply impossible, because campaigns were unable to link what they knew about voters to what cable providers knew about their customers. Obama’s advisors decided that the data made available in the private sector had long led political advertisers to ask the wrong questions. Walsh says of the effort to reimagine the media-targeting process: “It was not to get a better understanding of what 35-plus women watch on TV. It was to find out how many of our persuadable voters were watching those dayparts.”","Davidsen, whose previous work had left her intimately familiar with the rich data sets held in set-top boxes, understood that a lot of that data was available in the form of tuner and DVR histories collected by cable providers and then aggregated by research firms. For privacy reasons, however, the information was not available at the individual level. “The hardest thing in media buying right now is the lack of information,” she says.","Davidsen began negotiating to have research firms repackage their data in a form that would permit the campaign to access the individual histories without violating the cable providers’ privacy standards. Under a $350,000 deal she worked out with one company, Rentrak, the campaign provided a list of persuadable voters and their addresses, derived from its microtargeting models, and the company looked for them in the cable providers’ billing files. When a record matched, ­Rentrak would issue it a unique household ID that identified viewing data from a single set-top box but masked any personally identifiable information.","The Obama campaign had created its own television ratings system, a kind of Nielsen in which the only viewers who mattered were those not yet fully committed to a presidential candidate. But Davidsen had to get the information into a practical form by early May, when Obama strategists planned to start running their anti-Romney ads. She oversaw the development of a software platform the Obama staff called the Optimizer, which broke the day into 96 quarter-hour segments and assessed which time slots across 60 channels offered the greatest number of persuadable targets per dollar. (By September, she had unlocked an even richer trove of data: a cable system in Toledo, Ohio, that tracked viewers’ tuner histories by the second.) “The revolution of media buying in this campaign,” says Walsh, “was to turn what was a broadcast medium into something that looks a lot more like a narrowcast medium.”","When the Obama campaign did use television as a mass medium, it was because the Optimizer had concluded it would be a more efficient way of reaching persuadable targets. Sometimes a national cable ad was a better bargain than a large number of local buys in the 66 media markets reaching battleground states. But the occasional national buy also had other benefits. It could boost fund-raising and motivate volunteers in states that weren’t essential to Obama’s Electoral College arithmetic. And, says Davidsen, “it helps hide some of the strategy of your buying.”","Even without that tactic, Obama’s buys perplexed the Romney analysts in Boston. They had invested in their own media-intelligence platform, called Centraforce. It used some of the same aggregated data sources that were feeding into the Optimizer, and at times both seemed to send the campaigns to the same unlikely ad blocks—for example, in reruns on TV Land. But there was a lot more to what Lundry called Obama’s “highly variable” media strategy. Many of the Democrats’ ads were placed in fringe markets, on marginal stations, and at odd times where few political candidates had ever seen value. Romney’s data scientists simply could not decode those decisions without the voter models or persuasion experiments that helped Obama pick out individual targets. “We were never able to figure out the level of advertising and what they were trying to do,” says McGoldrick. “It wasn’t worth reverse-engineering, because what are you going to do?”","The Community","Although the voter opinion tables that emerged from the Cave looked a lot like polls, the analysts who produced them were disinclined to call them polls. The campaign had plenty of those, generated by a public-opinion team of eight outside firms, and new arrivals at the Chicago headquarters were shocked by the variegated breadth of the research that arrived on their desks daily. “We believed in combining the qual, which we did more than any campaign ever, with the quant, which we [also] did more than any other campaign, to make sure all communication for every level of the campaign was informed by what they found,” says David Simas, the director of opinion research.","Simas considered himself the “air-traffic controller” for such research, which was guided by a series of voter diaries that Obama’s team commissioned as it prepared for the reëlection campaign. “We needed to do something almost divorced from politics and get to the way they’re seeing their lives,” he says. The lead pollster, Joel Benenson, had respondents write about their experiences. The entries frequently used the word “disappointment,” which helped explain attitudes toward Obama’s administration but also spoke to a broader dissatisfaction with economic conditions. “That became the foundation for our entire research program,” says Simas.","Obama’s advisors used those diaries to develop messages that contrasted Obama with Romney as a fighter for the middle class. Benenson’s national polls tested language to see which affected voters’ responses in survey experiments and direct questioning. A quartet of polling firms were assigned specific states and asked to figure out which national themes fit best with local concerns. Eventually, Obama’s media advisors created more than 500 ads and tested them before an online sample of viewers selected by focus-group director David Binder.","But the campaign had to play defense, too. When something potentially damaging popped up in the news, like Democratic consultant Hilary Rosen’s declaration that Ann Romney had “never worked a day in her life,” Simas checked in with the Community, a private online bulletin board populated by 100 undecided voters Binder had recruited. Simas would monitor Community conversations to see which news events penetrated voter consciousness. Sometimes he had Binder show its members controversial material—like a video clip of Obama’s “You didn’t build that” comment—and ask if it changed their views of the candidate. “For me, it was a very quick way to draw back and determine whether something was a problem or not a problem,” says Simas.","When Wagner started packaging his department’s research into something that campaign leadership could read like a poll, a pattern became apparent. Obama’s numbers in key battleground states were low in the analytic tables, but Romney’s were too. There were simply more undecided voters in such states—sometimes nearly twice as many as the traditional pollsters found. A basic methodological distinction explained this discrepancy: microtargeting models required interviewing a lot of unlikely voters to give shape to a profile of what a nonvoter looked like, while pollsters tracking the horse race wanted to screen more rigorously for those likely to cast a ballot. The rivalry between the two units trying to measure public opinion grew intense: the analytic polls were a threat to the pollsters’ primacy and, potentially, to their business model. “I spent a lot of time within the campaign explaining to people that the numbers we get from analytics and the numbers we get from external pollsters did not need strictly to be reconciled,” says Walsh. “They were different.”","The scope of the analytic research enabled it to pick up movements too small for traditional polls to perceive. As Simas reviewed Wagner’s analytic tables in mid-October, he was alarmed to see that what had been a Romney lead of one to two points in Green Bay, Wisconsin, had grown into an advantage of between six and nine. Green Bay was the only media market in the state to experience such a shift, and there was no obvious explanation. But it was hard to discount. Whereas a standard 800-person statewide poll might have reached 100 respondents in the Green Bay area, analytics was placing 5,000 calls in Wisconsin in each five-day cycle—and benefiting from tens of thousands of other field contacts—to produce microtargeting scores. Analytics was talking to as many people in the Green Bay media market as traditional pollsters were talking to across Wisconsin every week. “We could have the confidence level to say, ‘This isn’t noise,’” says Simas. So the campaign’s media buyers aired an ad attacking Romney on outsourcing and beseeched Messina to send former president Bill Clinton and Obama himself to rallies there. (In the end, Romney took the county 50.3 to 48.5 percent.)","For the most part, however, the analytic tables demonstrated how stable the electorate was, and how predictable individual voters could be. Polls from the media and academic institutions may have fluctuated by the hour, but drawing on hundreds of data points to judge whether someone was a likely voter proved more reliable than using a seven-question battery like Gallup’s to do the same. “When you see this Pogo stick happening with the public data—the electorate is just not that volatile,” says Mitch Stewart, director of the Democratic campaign group Organizing for America. The analytic data offered a source of calm.","Romney’s advisors were similarly sanguine, but they were losing. They, too, believed it possible to project the composition of the electorate, relying on a method similar to Gallup’s: pollster Neil Newhouse asked respondents how likely they were to cast a ballot. Those who answered that question with a seven or below on a 10-point scale were disregarded as not inclined to vote. But that ignored the experimental methods that made it possible to measure individual behavior and the impact that a campaign itself could have on a citizen’s motivation. As a result, the Republicans failed to account for voters that the Obama campaign could be mobilizing even if they looked to Election Day without enthusiasm or intensity.","On the last day of the race, Wagner and his analytics staff left the Cave and rode the elevator up one floor in the campaign’s Chicago skyscraper to join members of other departments in a boiler room established to help track votes as they came in. Already, for over a month, Obama’s analysts had been counting ballots from states that allowed citizens to vote early. Each day, the campaign overlaid the lists of early voters released by election authorities with its modeling scores to project how many votes they could claim as their own.","By Election Day, Wagner’s analytic tables turned into predictions. Before the polls opened in Ohio, authorities in Hamilton County, the state’s third-largest and home to Cincinnati, released the names of 103,508 voters who had cast early ballots over the previous month. Wagner sorted them by microtargeting projections and found that 58,379 had individual support scores over 50.1—that is, the campaign’s models predicted that they were more likely than not to have voted for Obama. That amounted to 56.4 percent of the county’s votes, or a raw lead of 13,249 votes over Romney. Early ballots were the first to be counted after Ohio’s polls closed, and Obama’s senior staff gathered around screens in the boiler room to see the initial tally. The numbers settled almost exactly where Wagner had said they would: Obama got 56.6 percent of the votes in Hamilton County. In Florida, he was as close to the mark; Obama’s margin was only two-tenths of a percent off. “After those first two numbers, we knew,” says Bird. “It was dead-on.”","When Obama was reëlected, and by a far larger Electoral College margin than most outsiders had anticipated, his staff was exhilarated but not surprised. The next morning, Mitch Stewart sat in the boiler room, alone, monitoring the lagging votes as they came into Obama’s servers from election authorities in Florida, the last state to name a winner. The presidency was no longer at stake; the only thing that still hung in the balance was the accuracy of the analytics department’s predictions.","The Legacy","A few days after the election, as Florida authorities continued to count provisional ballots, a few staff members were directed, as four years before, to remain in Chicago. Their instructions were to produce another post-mortem report summing up the lessons of the past year and a half. The undertaking was called the Legacy Project, a grandiose title inspired by the idea that the innovations of Obama 2012 should be translated not only to the campaign of the next Democratic candidate for president but also to governance. Obama had succeeded in convincing some citizens that a modest adjustment to their behavior would affect, however marginally, the result of an election. Could he make them feel the same way about Congress?","Simas, who had served in the White House before joining the team, marveled at the intimacy of the campaign. Perhaps more than anyone else at headquarters, he appreciated the human aspect of politics. This had been his first presidential election, but before he became a political operative, Simas had been a politician himself, serving on the city council and school board in his hometown of Taunton, Massachusetts. He ran for office by knocking on doors and interacting individually with constituents (or those he hoped would become constituents), trying to track their moods and expectations.","In many respects, analytics had made it possible for the Obama campaign to recapture that style of politics. Though the old guard may have viewed such techniques as a disruptive force in campaigns, they enabled a presidential candidate to view the electorate the way local candidates do: as a collection of people who make up a more perfect union, each of them approachable on his or her terms, their changing levels of support and enthusiasm open to measurement and, thus, to respect. “What that gave us was the ability to run a national presidential campaign the way you’d do a local ward campaign,” Simas says. “You know the people on your block. People have relationships with one another, and you leverage them so you know the way they talk about issues, what they’re discussing at the coffee shop.”","Few events in American life other than a presidential election touch 126 million adults, or even a significant fraction that many, on a single day. Certainly no corporation, no civic institution, and very few government agencies ever do. Obama did so by reducing every American to a series of numbers. Yet those numbers somehow captured the individuality of each voter, and they were not demographic classifications. The scores measured the ability of people to change politics—and to be changed by it.","You've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nThis is your last free article this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read all your free articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nLog in for more, or subscribe now for unlimited online access.\nLog in for two more free articles, or subscribe now\nfor unlimited online access."],"isopubdate":"2016-02-01"}

Silence amid Facebook’s data scandal is not","text":["With news on Friday that Cambridge Analytica was able to harvest the data of millions of Facebook users, the world’s largest social network is now more than three days into one of the biggest privacy scandals in its history (which is saying a lot). Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally lost $6 billion yesterday as Facebook’s cratering stock price led a massive sell-off of tech-sector shares on Wall Street, and members of Congress have written a letter to Zuckerberg demanding answers.","But unlike with past scandals, where Zuckerberg would respond with sweeping manifestos about Facebook’s mission to connect the world, the CEO has yet to publicly address the Cambridge Analytica brouhaha. Instead, that responsibility seems to have fallen to Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Facebook’s vice president of AR/VR, who has been actively jousting with critics on Twitter, intent on driving home the point that Facebook did not–technically–suffer a “data breach.” Yesterday, Boz doubled down on damage control, posting on his personal Facebook page an expanded timeline of events related to the scandal.","Meanwhile, the question of Zuckerberg’s silence is practically becoming its own meme, with the hashtag #WheresZuck making the rounds on Twitter throughout much of the day yesterday.

I would not be surprised if he weighed in before the day is through, but who knows?","Either way, the protracted silence is not a good look.

Until now changing settings had been complex, spread over at least 20 screens, which had frustrated users.","The world's largest social network said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users' anger over how the company uses their data and as lawmakers around the globe called for strong regulation.","\"Last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies and help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,\" Facebook wrote in the blog post on Wednesday.","Facebook's shares were up 1.2 percent at $154 on Wednesday. They are still down almost 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled via a third-party app to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.","The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers - Facebook's lifeblood - and lead to tougher regulation.","Analysts said the revamps Facebook rolled out on Wednesday looked more like tweaks than big changes, making data management more transparent rather than changing the way the company does business.","\"It doesn't seem that the changes that have been proposed are particularly meaningful,\" Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. \"There are several problems and one needs to address operationally what Facebook is doing to provide confidence that personal data is protected.\"","Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers' access to user information.","The changes Facebook announced on Wednesday let users add more layers of protection, control what they share and delete it if they want to, control the ads they see, and manage who sees their posts and profile information.","There is also a new page - Access Your Information - where users can see the information they've shared and manage it.","\"The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg’s promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.","It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers.","They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a \"right to portability\" - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.","Lawmakers in the United States are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users' data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.","He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.","Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing.","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened.","(Reporting by Julia Fioretti; Additional reporting by Laharee Chatterjee and Arjun Panchadar; Writing by Susan Thomas; Editing by James Dalgleish)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Yesterday (March 16), the company announced the suspension of data analytics company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) and its prominent parent political firm Cambridge Analytica—three years after it illegally used the data of up to 50 million users.","According to a note shared by the company, in 2015 Facebook found out that, despite telling its users otherwise, Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan passed user data collected through personality testing app “thisisyourdigitallife” (which touted itself as a personality test used by psychologists) to the political firm Cambridge Analytica—a company owned by Robert Mercer and led by Steve Bannon at the time—and to Christopher Wylie, from a digital service company called Eunoia Technologies.","The 270,000 people who downloaded the app allowed it access not only to their data, but some of their friends’—depending on their settings. However, they did not authorize that their data be shared with other companies, a behavior that is in violation of Facebook platform policies. The revelation comes from reporting by The Observer.","According to Wylie, a whistleblower who detailed the illegal data use, saying the information was used in 2014 to profile individual US voters who were then served Donald Trump ads during the election. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,” Wylie told The Observer, “That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”","After finding out that the breach had happened, Facebook deleted the app, then requested a certification from all involved that the obtained data had been destroyed—but Facebook never followed up on it. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back,” Wylie said.","Only last month, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO and Facebook both told the British parliament the political firm did not harvest any of the social media user data to target election ads during Brexit.","The firm continues to deny the allegations:","Facebook has repeatedly denied that data breaches as the one detailed occurred—and even after finding out, years after the fact, that it had, the company defends its best practices. ”We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook states in the same note that admits their “vigorous enforcement” consisted in taking the word of someone who had already broken their regulation to ensure said information was protected.","Further, the note tries to put the responsibility of controlling such information on the user, but highlighting a the “ways we give people the tools to control their experience.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

It was alleged that the two companies gathered and shared the personal data of around 50 million Facebook users without consent.","The decision to suspend SCL and Cambridge Analytica came one day beforeThe New York Times and The Observer came out with reports detailing how Cambridge Analytica acquired and utilized private information of millions of Facebook users to develop voter profiles that were used to design highly targeted political ads during the last US Presidential Elections.","Cambridge Analytica is partly owned by Richard Mercer, a billionaire who was previously involved in Ted Cruz' 2015 presidential campaign before assisting Donald Trump's presidential bid in 2016. The company was supposedly brought in by Trump's campaign team to assist with its digital operations, which was being headed by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.","Facebook has admitted that the data Cambridge Analytica received came from Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor from the University of Cambridge, who designed an app that gave him permission to access the personal information of the users as well as that of their friends.","According to Facebook, Kogan gained access to the data legitimately and “through the proper channels that governed all developers” on the platform at the time. But afterward, Kogan passed the data he gathered to Cambridge Analytica. This was a clear breach of the social media's regulations.","A former employee of Cambridge apparently said to the Times that the information collected from Facebook became the basis of “its work on President Trump's campaign in 2016.”","Cambridge Analytica's suspension, coupled with The Observer and The New York Times reports, garnered someharsh reactions from lawmakers. Massachusetts' Attorney General Maura Healey has said her office will investigate this situation while several congressmen want Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear and testify before their committees.","It's not just American lawmakers who are unhappy with Zuckerberg and his company. Their British counterparts are also demanding that Zuckerberg or another senior executive talk to them about the alleged data breach and the continued risk to user's personal information.","UK lawmaker Damian Collins said the company's previous representatives gave “false assurance” that Facebook's policies are strong and well-managed.

Firstly, it knowingly scooped the media, never a smart move if you want to make people less suspicious of your actions. Secondly, it was quick to point the finger and not apologise. Several execs took to Twitter when there should have been a corporate clamp down and several even deleted tweets as the news broke. These are signs of a ruffled Facebook, a Facebook doesn't understand its role in the world and that should concern every human on the planet.","In short, Cambridge Analytica did not delete inappropriately shared information that Facebook users gave up willingly through third-party apps years ago. Someone's getting fired but who and how far is still v ery much up for debate. The answer to this question will depend on who knew (Facebook did), when (2015) and what they did about it (not alert users). While many are dubbing what happened as a 'breach', a misuse is a better way of thinking about it (nothing was stolen and Facebook didn't have anything broken into). Buckle in, this puppy has just exploded out of the box and no-one can remember if anyone took it to the toilet before they closed the lid.","Who is at fault? The ones who created it or the ones who exploited it? Fault implies that you are the cause of a situation; Facebook created a system that could be exploited but that doesn't make you fault-free if you choose to exploit it. Based on the evidence so far, fault appears to lay with Cambridge Analytica but are they responsible for the aftermath? N0, that's Facebook's problem. We can't blame all the woes of the world on Facebook. Sometimes it feels like all roads lead to Oz but there are lots of parties at work and things in play. Ultimately, we did this to ourselves.","We (the users) didn't look at the information plopped in front of us, we didn't update our privacy settings and we don't think people like Cambridge Analytica are out to 'get' us. Facebook has closed this gap in their net but the company is still fishing. Facebook remains a data company and if you see it as anything else, you're deluding yourself. What you/we do with this knowledge is the key. Cambridge Analytica won't be the last issue like this that Facebook faces because of the way Facebook is set up and how technology always seems to find a way to be abused. Publically, even though Facebook has done nothing illegal, they now have a huge issue because even if it's not your fault, it's your responsibility. Will this be the straw that breaks the camel's back and pushes the button on the regulation of a system that controls what 2.4 billion people see every day? I'm not sure but one thing is for sure, this latest issue for the Facebook is a big one and they fumbled the ball from the off.","Cambridge Analytica is the latest scandal to rock the world about Facebook but a close look at Facebook shows a deeply anti-competitive nature emerging. Copying of features, buying up of competitors and the introduction of a VPN to report back on user activity across apps making trends, features and behaviours easier to spot show a Facebook that is worried about the future. 'The beast must be protected at all costs' mentality seems to be showing more and more.","Damage-control and legal liability limitation is one thing but increasingly Facebook needs to convince more than law-makers that their product doesn't damage people, they need the users to believe it. A process that starts with taking responsibility when things go wrong and so far Facebook believes it has done that by cutting off access for Cambridge Analytica when what it's really done is thrown a blanket over a blood stain.","Paul runs a technology advisory business called HERE/FORTH.\nFollow him on Twitter @paul__armstrong.

Maybe our country is not ready for that, it’s possible, it’s possible.” Trump said “personally I can’t understand that” about those opposed to such drastic measures.","Some states already charge drug dealers with murder if customers overdose. In Florida, people who provide cocaine, heroin or the powerful opioid fentanyl to a person who dies from using the drug in question can be charged with first-degree murder and sentenced to either life in prison or death.","Drug-induced homicide laws, which emerged in the 1980s, are being used more frequently because of the opioids crisis, according to a November 2017 report by the Drug Policy Alliance. However, there is no evidence that such laws reduce drug use.","On Monday Trump was effectively sending a message to prosecutors to be harsher on drug dealers, who traffic in street drugs like heroin as well as black market prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin, and various versions of the potent narcotic fentanyl. But he did not call specifically for legislation to expand use of the death penalty for federal drug crimes.","The justice department said the federal death penalty is already available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the “drug kingpin” provisions of federal law.","The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, attended the event on Monday and sat next to Melania Trump. The DoJ later issued a statement, saying: “At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.”","Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear federal death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the supreme court.","New Hampshire has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, a fact Trump acknowledged last August when he said: “We have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire – I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den – [it] is coming from the southern border.”","The comment caused offence in the state, with the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan responding: “Instead of insulting people in the throes of addiction, [Trump] needs to work across party lines to actually stem the tide of this crisis.”","Though Trump is visiting to lobby for harsher sentencing for opioid-related crimes, New Hampshire is one of many states now pushing criminal justice reform.","On Monday, the state judiciary announced it would review bail policies, after nationwide criticism of courts that serve as de facto debtor’s prisons for people too poor to pay bail.","In 2012, substance use disorders such as opioid dependence cost New Hampshire $284m in criminal justice costs. More than half of jail and prison costs in the state are attributed to drug abuse, according to a report by the advocacy group New Futures. Nationally, 76% of inmates are believed to have substance use disorders, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.","Trump, who aims to be seen as tough on crime, has repeatedly highlighted his preference for the “ultimate penalty” for drug dealers.","At a Pennsylvania rally this month, Trump told supporters countries like Singapore have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish dealers. He argued that a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail.","“The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,” Trump said in remarks he echoed on Monday.","The president was joined in New Hampshire by the first lady, Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue, particularly as it pertains to her focus on child welfare.","Trump’s plan concerns law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the US. It also includes broadening education and awareness, expanding access to treatment and recovery effortsand government funding for efforts to develop non-addictive painkillers. He also said that the Department of Justice was “looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies.” Leading opioids makers in the US are already engulfed in a flurry of civil litigation brought by cities, counties and states.","Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","Q&A","Why is there an opioid crisis in America?","Almost 100 people are dying every day across America from opioid overdoses – more than car crashes and shootings combined. The majority of these fatalities reveal widespread addiction to powerful prescription painkillers. The crisis unfolded in the mid-90s when the US pharmaceutical industry began marketing legal narcotics, particularly OxyContin, to treat everyday pain. This slow-release opioid was vigorously promoted to doctors and, amid lax regulation and slick sales tactics, people were assured it was safe. But the drug was akin to luxury morphine, doled out like super aspirin, and highly addictive. What resulted was a commercial triumph and a public health tragedy. Belated efforts to rein in distribution fueled a resurgence of heroin and the emergence of a deadly, black market version of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. The crisis is so deep because it affects all races, regions and incomes"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.","Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.","The company, which the New York Times reported was staffed by mostly British workers then, assisted Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign before helping Trump’s.","WHAT DO THEY DO?","Cambridge Analytica markets itself as providing consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.","It does not list its corporate clients but on its website describes them as including a daily newspaper that wanted to know more about its subscribers, a women’s clothing brand that sought research on its customers and a U.S. auto insurer interested in marketing itself.","The company’s website lists five office locations in New York, Washington, London, Brazil and Malaysia.","WHEN DID IT FIRST GET ATTENTION?","After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm’s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a “secret sauce” it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.","Rival consultants and campaign aides, though, expressed doubts about the company’s claims. Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital operations in 2016, said the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica’s data, relying instead on voter data from a Republican National Committee operation.","WHAT IS IT ACCUSED OF?","Cambridge Analytica beginning in 2014 obtained data on 50 million Facebook users via means that deceived both the users and Facebook, the New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday.","The data was harvested by an application developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, the newspapers said. Some 270,000 people downloaded the application and logged in with their Facebook credentials, according to Facebook. The application gathered their data and data about their friends, and then Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, according to both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.","Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it did not initially know Kogan violated Facebook’s terms, and that it deleted the data once it found out in 2015. Kogan could not be reached for comment.","The data, though, was not deleted, the two newspapers reported on Saturday. Cambridge Analytica said that the allegation was not true. Facebook said it was investigating to verify the accuracy of the claim.","WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?","Facebook said it was pressing Cambridge Analytica for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. Facebook has hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help.","While Facebook investigates, the social network said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent SCL, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, from its platform for violating Facebook rules.","Facebook’s probe, though, may have to wait until government authorities complete their investigation. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s office and asked Facebook’s auditors to stand down in the meantime, according to Facebook.","Attorneys general from the U.S. states of Massachusetts and Connecticut have launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the attorney general’s office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

It had help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies, founded by the Trump supporter Peter Thiel.CreditCreditChris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images","As a start-up called Cambridge Analytica sought to harvest the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans in summer 2014, the company received help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies, a top Silicon Valley contractor to American spy agencies and the Pentagon.","It was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge’s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app — a mobile-phone-based personality quiz — to gain access to Facebook users’ friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.","Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach. By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app. The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users — and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so-called psychometric profiles of American voters, setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain.","Image","Mr. Thiel at Trump Tower in Manhattan. He serves on the board at Facebook.CreditEduardo Munoz/Reuters","The revelations pulled Palantir — co-founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel — into the furor surrounding Cambridge, which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016. Mr. Thiel, a supporter of President Trump, serves on the board at Facebook.","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a data expert and Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.","Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm’s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian.","Image","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.CreditParliamentary Recording Unit, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images","The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr. Wylie’s testimony on Tuesday. Both companies are linked to tech-driven billionaires who backed Mr. Trump’s campaign: Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer, the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate, while Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by Mr. Thiel, who was an initial investor in Facebook.","The Palantir employee, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, works on business development for the company, according to his LinkedIn page. In an initial statement, Palantir said it had “never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica, nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.” Later on Tuesday, Palantir revised its account, saying that Mr. Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company’s behalf when he advised Mr. Wylie on the Facebook data.","“We learned today that an employee, in 2013-2014, engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica,” the company said. “We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action.”","The company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort. Mr. Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role.","Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013, Mr. Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr. Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account. At the time, Mr. Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group, which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr. Mercer the next year. The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles, a product code-named “Big Daddy.”","A former intern at SCL — Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Eric Schmidt, then Google’s executive chairman — urged the company to link up with Palantir, according to Mr. Wylie’s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times.","“Ever come across Palantir. Amusingly Eric Schmidt’s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them?” one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email.","Ms. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica.","In early 2013, Alexander Nix, an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns.","A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership, in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work. Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Nix and Mr. Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014, but Palantir executives again declined.","In his testimony, Mr. Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship. But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge’s psychographic models.","“There were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Mr. Wylie told lawmakers. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.” He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them.","Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge’s backing from Mr. Mercer, one of the world’s richest men, according to messages viewed by The Times. And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir’s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business.","In an interview this month with The Times, Mr. Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics. Those discussions continued through spring 2014, according to Mr. Wylie.","Mr. Wylie said that he and Mr. Nix visited Palantir’s London office on Soho Square. One side was set up like a high-security office, Mr. Wylie said, with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes. The other side, he said, was like a tech start-up — “weird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer, and there’s a Ping-Pong table.”","Mr. Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr. Wylie’s team in 2014, as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski, to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr. Kosinski had built. The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge’s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients.","“I had left field idea,” Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014. “What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook?” Reproducing the app, Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote, “could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy.”","Those negotiations failed. But Mr. Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher, the Russian-American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook. Over subsequent months, Dr. Kogan’s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters.","Carole Cadwalladr contributed reporting.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Spy Contractor’s Idea Helped A Firm Harvest Facebook Data.

{"originalurl":"https://www.sans.org/security-awareness-training/blog/what-communicate-about-facebook","title":"What to Communicate About Facebook | SANS Security Awareness","text":["What to Communicate About Facebook","March 27, 2018","Social Media","Social Media","Facebook has been in the news extensively about several privacy issues and violations, one of the biggest being the records of over 50 million Facebook users being sold to and used by Cambridge Analytica. While there are various legal and privacy issues at play here, ultimately the issue is one of trust. People’s trust in Facebook has been severely damaged, causing them to ask what the issues are, and more importantly what they can do to secure themselves. Here is an email template you can use to communicate to your workforce about this very topic. Personal events like this are the perfect opportunity to engage with and help secure your workforce.","Folks, we know and understand many of you have been following Facebook in the news about several big privacy incidents and allegations. We wanted to provide you with a short summary of what those issues are, and more importantly what you can do to protect yourself. First, a brief overview. The US Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated terms of a 2011 settlement when data of up to 50 million users were transferred to Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm. This data was originally collected from a Facebook app called “thisisyourdigitallife”. The app not only collected extensive data from people who downloaded it, but the app connected data on their friends also. This incident is raising a lot of questions, to include what other data has been collected by other apps, and how was that data shared. Below are steps you can take to protect your privacy. Note that while these steps are specific to Facebook, you should consider following the same steps for any social networking sites you use online. In addition, Facebook will be making privacy changes in the coming months, as such, some of the links or options listed below may change.","Deactivate: The second option is to Deactivate Your Facebook Account, which is in your General Account Settings. This freezes your online activity to include disabling your profile and remove your name and photo from most things you've shared on Facebook. However, you will still be able to message people. Unlike Deletion, with Deactivation you can Re-activate your account, which means your profile and past activity is restored.","Minimize Apps: The issue is not only what data Facebook collects about your activity, but what data any third party apps that connect to your Facebook account, apps such as Clash of Clans or What is Your Inner Age. Only install apps you need and minimize what they collect. Why do you think there has been such an explosion of these fun and free apps? Because they make money harvesting your information. In addition, limit what others share about you with their apps in the “Apps Others Use” section. Finally, delete an app when you no longer need it or no longer trust it. Not sure what apps you have? Check out your apps page and review your apps. Every app you have is just one more opportunity for others to collect information about you.","Logins: Many websites (and apps) give you the option of using your Facebook account to login. While that is convenient, it just means more data sharing is happening between that website and your Facebook account. Protect your privacy by using a unique login for each and every account you have. Can’t remember all of your passwords? Neither can we, that is why we recommend a Password Manager.","Sharing: Always be careful what you share with others. If you do not want your parents or boss to read it, you probably should not post it. Yes, you can use privacy options to control who can read your posts, but remember those can be confusing and change often, so what you thought was privately shared can become publicly available.","Two-factor Authentication:Finally, while not related to privacy, one of the best steps you can take to securing any of your online accounts is to enable two-factor authentication. This requires a second step to logging into the site. This very simple step is one of THE most effective ways you can secure your online accounts.","Unfortunately, these steps are not as simple as we would like. Facebook and other sites do this on purpose, they make money by collecting your information. We want you to be aware that information is being collected about you and the steps you can take to protect yourself. Finally, while these steps are specific to Facebook, keep in mind many other free sites have the same issues.","About the Author","Lance Spitzner","Director, SANS Security Awareness","Lance Spitzner has over 20 years of security experience in cyber threat research, security architecture, awareness and training.

Now, 28-year-old Christopher Wylie goes on the record to discuss his role in hijacking the profiles of millions of Facebook users in order to target the US electorate","The first time I met Christopher Wylie, he didn’t yet have pink hair. That comes later. As does his mission to rewind time. To put the genie back in the bottle.","By the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time. On the phone, he was clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller. A politicker. A data science nerd.","Two months later, when he arrived in London from Canada, he was all those things in the flesh. And yet the flesh was impossibly young. He was 27 then (he’s 28 now), a fact that has always seemed glaringly at odds with what he has done. He may have played a pivotal role in the momentous political upheavals of 2016. At the very least, he played a consequential role. At 24, he came up with an idea that led to the foundation of a company called Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that went on to claim a major role in the Leave campaign for Britain’s EU membership referendum, and later became a key figure in digital operations during Donald Trump’s election campaign.","Or, as Wylie describes it, he was the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool”.","In 2014, Steve Bannon – then executive chairman of the “alt-right” news network Breitbart – was Wylie’s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica’s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the US electorate.","It was Wylie who came up with that idea and oversaw its realisation. And it was Wylie who, last spring, became my source. In May 2017, I wrote an article headlined “The great British Brexit robbery”, which set out a skein of threads that linked Brexit to Trump to Russia. Wylie was one of a handful of individuals who provided the evidence behind it. I found him, via another Cambridge Analytica ex-employee, lying low in Canada: guilty, brooding, indignant, confused. “I haven’t talked about this to anyone,” he said at the time. And then he couldn’t stop talking.","By that time, Steve Bannon had become Trump’s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, had won contracts with the US State Department and was pitching to the Pentagon, and Wylie was genuinely freaked out. “It’s insane,” he told me one night. “The company has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It’s like Nixon on steroids.”","He ended up showing me a tranche of documents that laid out the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. And in the months following publication of my article in May,it was revealed that the company had “reached out” to WikiLeaks to help distribute Hillary Clinton’s stolen emails in 2016. And then we watched as it became a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian collusion in the US election.","The Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation. We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was “information warfare”. But Wylie offers a unique, worm’s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US’s democratic process.","Wylie oversaw what may have been the first critical breach. Aged 24, while studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he came up with a plan to harvest the Facebook profiles of millions of people in the US, and to use their private and personal information to create sophisticated psychological and political profiles. And then target them with political ads designed to work on their particular psychological makeup.","He hesitates. “I’ll point out that I assumed it was entirely legal and above board.”","Last month, Facebook’s UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads:","Christian Matheson (MP for Chester): “Have you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?”","Simon Milner: “No.”","Matheson: “But they do hold a large chunk of Facebook’s user data, don’t they?”","Milner: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Two weeks later, on 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix: “Does any of the data come from Facebook?” Nix replied: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","And through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that – at least in 2014 – that certainly wasn’t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters – records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.","Going public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.","It’s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it’s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic – Robert Mueller’s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer’s first article in this investigation.","It has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind – to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold.","There are many points where this story could begin. One is in 2012, when Wylie was 21 and working for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, then in government as junior coalition partners. His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","Wylie grew up in British Columbia and as a teenager he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He left school at 16 without a single qualification. Yet at 17, he was working in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition; at 18, he went to learn all things data from Obama’s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to Canada for the Liberal party. At 19, he taught himself to code, and in 2010, age 20, he came to London to study law at the London School of Economics.","“Politics is like the mob, though,” he says. “You never really leave. I got a call from the Lib Dems. They wanted to upgrade their databases and voter targeting. So, I combined working for them with studying for my degree.”","Politics is also where he feels most comfortable. He hated school, but as an intern in the Canadian parliament he discovered a world where he could talk to adults and they would listen. He was the kid who did the internet stuff and within a year he was working for the leader of the opposition.","It showed these odd patterns. People who liked 'I hate Israel' on Facebook also tended to like KitKats","“He’s one of the brightest people you will ever meet,” a senior politician who’s known Wylie since he was 20 told me. “Sometimes that’s a blessing and sometimes a curse.”","Starting in 2007,Stillwell, while a student, had devised various apps for Facebook, one of which, a personality quiz called myPersonality, had gone viral. Users were scored on “big five” personality traits – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism – and in exchange, 40% of them consented to give him access to their Facebook profiles. Suddenly, there was a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook “likes” across millions of people.","Examples, above and below, of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test. Respondents were asked: How important should this message be to all Americans?","The research was original, groundbreaking and had obvious possibilities. “They had a lot of approaches from the security services,” a member of the centre told me. “There was one called You Are What You Like and it was demonstrated to the intelligence services. And it showed these odd patterns; that, for example, people who liked ‘I hate Israel’ on Facebook also tended to like Nike shoes and KitKats.","“There are agencies that fund research on behalf of the intelligence services. And they were all over this research. That one was nicknamed Operation KitKat.”","The defence and military establishment were the first to see the potential of the research. Boeing, a major US defence contractor, funded Kosinski’s PhD and Darpa, the US government’s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is cited in at least two academic papers supporting Kosinski’s work.","But when, in 2013, the first major paper was published, others saw this potential too, including Wylie. He had finished his degree and had started his PhD in fashion forecasting, and was thinking about the Lib Dems. It is fair to say that he didn’t have a clue what he was walking into.","“I wanted to know why the Lib Dems sucked at winning elections when they used to run the country up to the end of the 19th century,” Wylie explains. “And I began looking at consumer and demographic data to see what united Lib Dem voters, because apart from bits of Wales and the Shetlands it’s weird, disparate regions. And what I found is there were no strong correlations. There was no signal in the data.","“And then I came across a paper about how personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour, and it suddenly made sense. Liberalism is correlated with high openness and low conscientiousness, and when you think of Lib Dems they’re absent-minded professors and hippies. They’re the early adopters… they’re highly open to new ideas. And it just clicked all of a sudden.”","Here was a way for the party to identify potential new voters. The only problem was that the Lib Dems weren’t interested.","“I did this presentation at which I told them they would lose half their 57 seats, and they were like: ‘Why are you so pessimistic?’ They actually lost all but eight of their seats, FYI.”","Another Lib Dem connection introduced Wylie to a company called SCL Group, one of whose subsidiaries, SCL Elections, would go on to create Cambridge Analytica (an incorporated venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, funded by the latter). For all intents and purposes, SCL/Cambridge Analytica are one and the same.","Alexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn’t resist. “He said: ‘We’ll give you total freedom. Experiment. Come and test out all your crazy ideas.’”","Another example of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test.","In the history of bad ideas, this turned out to be one of the worst. The job was research director across the SCL group, a private contractor that has both defence and elections operations. Its defence arm was a contractor to the UK’s Ministry of Defence and the US’s Department of Defense, among others. Its expertise was in “psychological operations” – or psyops –changing people’s minds not through persuasion but through “informational dominance”, a set of techniques that includes rumour, disinformation and fake news.","SCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to realise were unequipped to defend themselves.","Wylie holds a British Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa – a UK work visa given to just 200 people a year. He was working inside government (with the Lib Dems) as a political strategist with advanced data science skills. But no one, least of all him, could have predicted what came next. When he turned up at SCL’s offices in Mayfair, he had no clue that he was walking into the middle of a nexus of defence and intelligence projects, private contractors and cutting-edge cyberweaponry.","“The thing I think about all the time is, what if I’d taken a job at Deloitte instead? They offered me one. I just think if I’d taken literally any other job, Cambridge Analytica wouldn’t exist. You have no idea how much I brood on this.”","A few months later, in autumn 2013, Wylie met Steve Bannon. At the time, he was editor-in-chief of Breitbart, which he had brought to Britain to support his friend Nigel Farage in his mission to take Britain out of the European Union.","What was he like?","“Smart,” says Wylie. “Interesting. Really interested in ideas. He’s the only straight man I’ve ever talked to about intersectional feminist theory. He saw its relevance straightaway to the oppressions that conservative, young white men feel.”","Wylie meeting Bannon was the moment petrol was poured on a flickering flame. Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time. He had a theory to prove. And at the time, this was a purely intellectual problem. Politics was like fashion, he told Bannon.","If you do not respect the agency of people, anything you do after that point is not conducive to democracy","Christopher Wylie","“[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’ to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.”","But Wylie wasn’t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: “information operations”, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military’s doctrine of the “five-dimensional battle space”. His brief ranged across the SCL Group – the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.","I tell him that another former employee described the firm as “MI6 for hire”, and I’d never quite understood it.","“It’s like dirty MI6 because you’re not constrained. There’s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It’s normal for a ‘market research company’ to amass data on domestic populations. And if you’re working in some country and there’s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that’s just a bonus.”","When I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it’s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. “And the cyberwarfare guy is like, ‘Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.’”","It was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer – the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates – and his daughter Rebekah.","Nix and Wylie flew to New York to meet the Mercers in Rebekah’s Manhattan apartment.","“She loved me. She was like, ‘Oh we need more of your type on our side!’”","Your type?","“The gays. She loved the gays. So did Steve [Bannon]. He saw us as early adopters. He figured, if you can get the gays on board, everyone else will follow. It’s why he was so into the whole Milo [Yiannopoulos] thing.”","Robert Mercer was a pioneer in AI and machine translation. He helped invent algorithmic trading – which replaced hedge fund managers with computer programs – and he listened to Wylie’s pitch. It was for a new kind of political message-targeting based on an influential and groundbreaking 2014 paper researched at Cambridge’s Psychometrics Centre, called: “Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans”.","“In politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it’s the opposite way around with Mercer,” says Wylie. “He said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.”","And to do that, Wylie needed data.","How Cambridge Analytica acquired the data has been the subject of internal reviews at Cambridge University, of many news articles and much speculation and rumour.","When Nix was interviewed by MPs last month, Damian Collins asked him:","“Does any of your data come from Global Science Research company?”","Nix: “GSR?”","Collins: “Yes.”","Nix: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Collins: “They have not supplied you with data or information?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “Your datasets are not based on information you have received from them?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “At all?”","Nix: “At all.”","The problem with Nix’s response to Collins is that Wylie has a copy of an executed contract, dated 4 June 2014, which confirms that SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with a company called Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, specifically premised on the harvesting and processing of Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.","He has receipts showing that Cambridge Analytica spent $7m to amass this data, about $1m of it with GSR. He has the bank records and wire transfers. Emails reveal Wylie first negotiated with Michal Kosinski, one of the co-authors of the original myPersonality research paper, to use the myPersonality database. But when negotiations broke down, another psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, offered a solution that many of his colleagues considered unethical. He offered to replicate Kosinski and Stillwell’s research and cut them out of the deal. For Wylie it seemed a perfect solution. “Kosinski was asking for $500,000 for the IP but Kogan said he could replicate it and just harvest his own set of data.” (Kosinski says the fee was to fund further research.)","An unethical solution? Dr Aleksandr Kogan Photograph: alex kogan","Kogan then set up GSR to do the work, and proposed to Wylie they use the data to set up an interdisciplinary institute working across the social sciences. “What happened to that idea,” I ask Wylie. “It never happened. I don’t know why. That’s one of the things that upsets me the most.”","It was Bannon’s interest in culture as war that ignited Wylie’s intellectual concept. But it was Robert Mercer’s millions that created a firestorm. Kogan was able to throw money at the hard problem of acquiring personal data: he advertised for people who were willing to be paid to take a personality quiz on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics. At the end of which Kogan’s app, called thisismydigitallife, gave him permission to access their Facebook profiles. And not just theirs, but their friends’ too. On average, each “seeder” – the people who had taken the personality test, around 320,000 in total – unwittingly gave access to at least 160 other people’s profiles, none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect.","What the email correspondence between Cambridge Analytica employees and Kogan shows is that Kogan had collected millions of profiles in a matter of weeks. But neither Wylie nor anyone else at Cambridge Analytica had checked that it was legal. It certainly wasn’t authorised. Kogan did have permission to pull Facebook data, but for academic purposes only. What’s more, under British data protection laws, it’s illegal for personal data to be sold to a third party without consent.","“Facebook could see it was happening,” says Wylie. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, ‘Fine’.”","Kogan maintains that everything he did was legal and he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Cambridge Analytica had its data. This was the foundation of everything it did next – how it extracted psychological insights from the “seeders” and then built an algorithm to profile millions more.","For more than a year, the reporting around what Cambridge Analytica did or didn’t do for Trump has revolved around the question of “psychographics”, but Wylie points out: “Everything was built on the back of that data. The models, the algorithm. Everything. Why wouldn’t you use it in your biggest campaign ever?”","In December 2015, the Guardian’s Harry Davies published the first report about Cambridge Analytica acquiring Facebook data and using it to support Ted Cruz in his campaign to be the US Republican candidate. But it wasn’t until many months later that Facebook took action. And then, all they did was write a letter. In August 2016, shortly before the US election, and two years after the breach took place, Facebook’s lawyers wrote to Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and told him the data had been illicitly obtained and that “GSR was not authorised to share or sell it”. They said it must be deleted immediately.","“I already had. But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,” says Wylie. “Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.”","There were multiple copies of it. It had been emailed in unencrypted files.","Cambridge Analytica rejected all allegations the Observer put to them.","Dr Kogan – who later changed his name to Dr Spectre, but has subsequently changed it back to Dr Kogan – is still a faculty member at Cambridge University, a senior research associate. But what his fellow academics didn’t know until Kogan revealed it in emails to the Observer (although Cambridge University says that Kogan told the head of the psychology department), is that he is also an associate professor at St Petersburg University. Further research revealed that he’s received grants from the Russian government to research “Stress, health and psychological wellbeing in social networks”. The opportunity came about on a trip to the city to visit friends and family, he said.","There are other dramatic documents in Wylie’s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: “We have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that “they understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections” but that they were “failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers”. The work, he said, would be “shared with the CEO of the business”, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.","“It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Wylie. “I didn’t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?”","Mueller’s investigation traces the first stages of the Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 US election back to 2014, when the Russian state made what appears to be its first concerted efforts to harness the power of America’s social media platforms, including Facebook. And it was in late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented the Russian oil company with an outline of its datasets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with “consumers”. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques. The first slide illustrates how a “rumour campaign” spread fear in the 2007 Nigerian election – in which the company worked – by spreading the idea that the “election would be rigged”. The final slide, branded with Lukoil’s logo and that of SCL Group and SCL Elections, headlines its “deliverables”: “psychographic messaging”.","Robert Mercer with his daughter Rebekah. Photograph: Sean Zanni/Getty Images","Lukoil is a private company, but its CEO, Alekperov, answers to Putin, and it’s been used as a vehicle of Russian influence in Europe and elsewhere – including in the Czech Republic, where in 2016 it was revealed that an adviser to the strongly pro-Russian Czech president was being paid by the company.","When I asked Bill Browder – an Anglo-American businessman who is leading a global campaign for a Magnitsky Act to enforce sanctions against Russian individuals – what he made of it, he said: “Everyone in Russia is subordinate to Putin. One should be highly suspicious of any Russian company pitching anything outside its normal business activities.”","Last month, Nix told MPs on the parliamentary committee investigating fake news: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do not have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","There’s no evidence that Cambridge Analytica ever did any work for Lukoil. What these documents show, though, is that in 2014 one of Russia’s biggest companies was fully briefed on: Facebook, microtargeting, data, election disruption.","Cambridge Analytica is “Chris’s Frankenstein”, says a friend of his. “He created it. It’s his data Frankenmonster. And now he’s trying to put it right.”","Only once has Wylie made the case of pointing out that he was 24 at the time. But he was. He thrilled to the intellectual possibilities of it. He didn’t think of the consequences. And I wonder how much he’s processed his own role or responsibility in it. Instead, he’s determined to go on the record and undo this thing he has created.","Because the past few months have been like watching a tornado gathering force. And when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something – his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead – it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold. Dealing with someone trained in information warfare has its own particular challenges, and his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off. And not everyone’s a fan. Any number of ex-colleagues – even the ones who love him – call him “Machiavellian”. Another described the screaming matches he and Nix would have.","“What do your parents make of your decision to come forward?” I ask him.","“They get it. My dad sent me a cartoon today, which had two characters hanging off a cliff, and the first one’s saying ‘Hang in there.’ And the other is like: ‘Fuck you.’”","Which are you?","“Probably both.”","What isn’t in doubt is what a long, fraught journey it has been to get to this stage. And how fearless he is.","After many months, I learn the terrible, dark backstory that throws some light on his determination, and which he discusses candidly. At six, while at school, Wylie was abused by a mentally unstable person. The school tried to cover it up, blaming his parents, and a long court battle followed. Wylie’s childhood and school career never recovered. His parents – his father is a doctor and his mother is a psychiatrist – were wonderful, he says. “But they knew the trajectory of people who are put in that situation, so I think it was particularly difficult for them, because they had a deeper understanding of what that does to a person long term.”","Facebook has denied and denied this. It has failed in its duties to respect the law","Paul-Olivier Dehaye","He says he grew up listening to psychologists discuss him in the third person, and, aged 14, he successfully sued the British Columbia Ministry of Education and forced it to change its inclusion policies around bullying. What I observe now is how much he loves the law, lawyers, precision, order. I come to think of his pink hair as a false-flag operation. What he cannot tolerate is bullying.","Is what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying?","“I think it’s worse than bullying,” Wylie says. “Because people don’t necessarily know it’s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it’s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you’re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.”","Russia, Facebook, Trump, Mercer, Bannon, Brexit. Every one of these threads runs through Cambridge Analytica. Even in the past few weeks, it seems as if the understanding of Facebook’s role has broadened and deepened. The Mueller indictments were part of that, but Paul-Olivier Dehaye – a data expert and academic based in Switzerland, who published some of the first research into Cambridge Analytica’s processes– says it’s become increasingly apparent that Facebook is “abusive by design”. If there is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be in the platform’s data flows, he says. And Wylie’s revelations only move it on again.","“Facebook has denied and denied and denied this,” Dehaye says when told of the Observer’s new evidence. “It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law. It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked","Read more","Facebook denies that the data transfer was a breach. In addition, a spokesperson said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules. Both Aleksandr Kogan as well as the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Millions of people’s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn’t have seen, and couldn’t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, “would work for anyone”. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?","It occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.","“Yes.”","Nato or non-Nato?","“Either. I mean they’re mercenaries. They’ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.”","It’s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing – at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public – our intimate family connections, our “likes”, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that’s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.","The Facebook data is out in the wild. And for all Wylie’s efforts, there’s no turning the clock back.","Tamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that she’d pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence.","She calls Wylie’s disclosures “wild” and points out that “the whole Facebook project” has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment.","“It’s a form of very deep but soft power that’s been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. It’s making this point, isn’t it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that they’ve turned on itself.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

I am not a cool person,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of the social-media giant, in 2014. That has never been more true. His company has spent the past year stumbling through controversies over the peddling of fake news and enabling Russian manipulation of American voters, with various degrees of ineptitude. Then, on March 17th, articles in the New York Times and Britain's Observer newspaper suggested that a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had obtained detailed data about some 50m Facebook users and shared this trove of information and analysis with third parties, including Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The result is a corporate crisis--and a political reckoning.","Republicans and Democrats alike have called on Mr Zuckerberg and the heads of other tech firms to testify before the Senate. America's consumer watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), has also reportedly launched an investigation into Facebook's privacy policies and whether it violated a consent decree of 2011 requiring the social network to notify users about how their data are shared. British MPs have called for Mr Zuckerberg to come before a select committee.","Even Facebook's allies have unfriended it. On Twitter, Brian Acton, a co-founder of the popular messaging app WhatsApp (which Facebook bought for $22bn in 2014), encouraged people to \"#DeleteFacebook\". News of his post pinged around the internet, including on Facebook itself. Investors, who have forgiven months of bad headlines in light of Facebook's strong financial performance, are growing jittery. Between March 16th and March 21st the firm's share price fell by 8.5%, erasing $45bn in market value. Facebook is still the world's eighth-most-valuable publicly listed firm, but shareholders worry that politicians in Europe and America may impose onerous restrictions on data, suppressing growth.","Help yourself to our data","The Cambridge Analytica scandal reveals Facebook's morphing, porous privacy policies and the company's cavalier approach to oversight. The data on Facebook users were obtained by Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge University, who enticed some 270,000 people to take part in a survey in exchange for a small fee. When those users installed the survey app, they shared details about themselves and--unwittingly--their friends, around 50m Facebook users in all. Surprisingly, before 2015 Facebook's rules allowed the mining of social connections without each user's consent.","What happened next was never permitted by Facebook. Mr Kogan provided these data to Cambridge Analytica, which then allegedly shared them with customers, including Mr Trump's campaign. Cambridge Analytica is backed by Robert Mercer, a Republican donor; Steve Bannon, formerly a top adviser to Mr Trump, used to serve as an executive. (The Economist used Cambridge Analytica for a market-research project in the past.)","Although news of Cambridge Analytica's peddling of Facebook data was first reported in December 2015, the social network reportedly did not respond until eight months later, with a letter asking the firm to delete the data. It seems not to have checked that this was done. The lax response is evidence of wider \"systemic operational problems\", says Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research, who follows the firm.","If reports are to be believed, Cambridge Analytica has a habit of pushing ethical and legal boundaries to gather data. On March 20th Alexander Nix, its chief executive, was suspended after recordings were aired on British television that seem to capture him describing manipulating people for information. Britain's data-protection regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, is expected to search Cambridge Analytica's offices.","The scandal reverberates through politics as well as the internet. Facebook has built a mammoth advertising business, with sales of around $40bn in 2017, by gathering detailed information about users' identities and behaviour online and then selling access to them. Facebook tracks users not only on its services, including its eponymous social network and Instagram (which it owns), but across the web. Knowing that someone is a dog owner and interested in buying a new lead may not seem controversial. \"Microtargeting\" someone in order to influence their political views and voting behaviour appears more sinister.","Though political advertising is still a minuscule percentage of Facebook's revenues, perhaps around 3%, it is a growing and lucrative line. Politicians have found that using Facebook can pay dividends. Even without using illegitimately obtained data to boost targeting, the social-media firm offers precise tools to political campaigns, including reaching users on Facebook whose names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses they already have. Facebook also enables campaigns to target voters who show an interest in the same issues or have similar profiles, packaging them into what it calls \"lookalike audiences\". No other Western company apart from Google has such rich data.","Barack Obama's campaigns were digitally sophisticated and used Facebook to reach prospective voters. Yet Mr Obama got proper permission to obtain data about people's friends and did not microtarget users on an industrial scale, unlike Mr Trump's campaign. Targeting based on Cambridge Analytica's data may have helped Mr Trump win the presidency, although how much cannot be known.","A tepid response","Companies can overcome scandals. Rupert Murdoch, a media mogul, survived a maelstrom in 2011 when it was reported that a newspaper he owned had hacked the phone of a murdered girl, Milly Dowler. Mr Zuckerberg, like Mr Murdoch, has structured ownership of his firm so that he controls super-voting shares, and will probably maintain his power. But there is speculation that some of his lieutenants, including Sheryl Sandberg, could leave in the next year. The head of security, Alex Stamos, is expected to resign.","Mr Zuckerberg's response to the scandal has been modest. He has apologised and promised thorough audits of third-party app developers and steps to make it easier for users to control their privacy settings. Such basic assurances may not be enough to reverse flagging corporate morale and win back the enthusiasm of users. Trust in social media is already low, and Americans have been spending less time on Facebook, in part because so much of what they see online is negative and dubious. Globally, users spent around 50m hours less per day on Facebook in the fourth quarter of 2017, which translates into a 15% drop in time spent year over year, according to Mr Wieser.","As some users turn away, politicians in America and Europe are likely to give Facebook more of their attention. They are scrutinising Facebook's conduct and may propose new laws, especially in the domain of data privacy. In May regulations concerning data protection and user consent will come into effect in Europe. America has historically been weak on data protection, except for specific industries like health care. Overworked regulators have typically responded to reports of misconduct on a case-by-case basis, and the online advertising industry has been trusted to police itself.","Mr Obama was in favour of a consumer-privacy bill of rights, which would give users more control of their online data by requiring user consent. That made little headway because of opposition from the industry. Some politicians may want to revive talk of such a law, especially as Europe strengthens its safeguards. But political reformers seldom have an easy time in America. And, like many others, politicians have come to rely on Facebook.","The social-media giant faces a reputational crisis. Here is how\nit and the industry should respond","LAST year the idea took hold that Mark Zuckerberg might run for\npresident in 2020 and seek to lead the world's most powerful country.\nToday, Facebook's founder is fighting to show that he is capable of leading the\nworld's eighth-biggest listed company or that any of its 2.1bn users should\ntrust it.","News that Cambridge Analytica (CA), a firm linked to President\nDonald Trump's 2016 campaign, got data on 50m Facebook users in dubious,\npossibly illegal, ways has lit a firestorm (see United States section). Mr\nZuckerberg took five days to reply and, when he did, he conceded that Facebook had let its users\ndown in the past but seemed not to have grasped that its business faces a wider\ncrisis of confidence. After months of talk about propaganda and fake news,\npoliticians in Europe and, increasingly, America see Facebook as out of control and in\ndenial. Congress wants him to testify. Expect a roasting.","Since the news, spooked investors have wiped 9% off Facebook's shares. Consumers are\nbelatedly waking up to the dangers of handing over data to tech giants that are\nrun like black boxes. Already, according to the Pew Research Centre, a\nthink-tank, a majority of Americans say they distrust social-media firms. Mr\nZuckerberg and his industry need to change, fast.","The\naddiction game","Facebook's business relies on\nthree elements: keeping users glued to their screens, collecting data about\ntheir behaviour and convincing advertisers to pay billions of dollars to reach\nthem with targeted ads. The firm has an incentive to promote material that\ngrabs attention and to sell ads to anyone. Its culture melds a ruthless pursuit\nof profit with a Panglossian and narcissistic belief in its own virtue. Mr\nZuckerberg controls the firm's voting rights. Clearly, he gets too little\ncriticism.","In the latest fiasco, it emerged that in 2013 an academic in\nBritain built a questionnaire app for Facebook users, which\n270,000 people answered. They in turn had 50m Facebook friends. Data on all\nthese people then ended up with CA. (Full disclosure: The Economist once used\nCA for a market-research project.) Facebook says that it could\nnot happen again and that the academic and CA broke its rules; both deny doing anything\nwrong. Regulators in Europe and America are investigating.Facebook knew of the problem\nin 2015, but it did not alert individual users. Although nobody knows how much\nCA benefited Mr Trump's campaign, the fuss has been amplified by the left's\ndisbelief that he could have won the election fairly.","But that does not give Facebook a defence. The\nepisode fits an established pattern of sloppiness towards privacy, tolerance of\ninaccuracy and reluctance to admit mistakes. In early 2017 Mr Zuckerberg\ndismissed the idea that fake news had influenced the election as \"pretty\ncrazy\". In September Facebook said Kremlin-linked\nfirms had spent a mere $100,000 to buy 3,000 adverts on its platform, failing\nat first to mention that 150m users had seen free posts by Russian operatives.\nIt has also repeatedly misled advertisers about its user statistics.","Facebook is not about to be\nbanned or put out of business, but the chances of a regulatory backlash are\ngrowing. Europe is inflicting punishment by a thousand cuts, from digital taxes\nto antitrust cases. And distrustful users are switching off. The American\ncustomer base of Facebook's core social network has stagnated since June 2017. Its share\nof America's digital advertising market is forecast to dip this year for the\nfirst time. The network effect that made Facebook ever more\nattractive to new members as it grew could work in reverse if it starts to\nshrink. Facebook is worth $493bn, but only has $14bn of physical assets.\nIts value is intangible--and, potentially, ephemeral.","If Mr Zuckerberg wants to do right by the public and his firm,\nhe must rebuild trust. So far he has promised to audit some apps, restrict\ndevelopers' access to data still further, and help people control which apps\nhave access to their data.","That doesn't go nearly far enough. Facebook needs a full,\nindependent examination of its approach to content, privacy and data, including\nits role in the 2016 election and the Brexit referendum. This should be made\npublic. Each year Facebook should publish a report on its conduct that sets out\neverything from the prevalence of fake news to privacy breaches.","Next, Facebook and other tech firms need to open up to outsiders, safely\nand methodically. They should create an industry ombudsman--call it the Data\nRights Board. Part of its job would be to set and enforce the rules by which\naccredited independent researchers look inside platforms without threatening\nusers' privacy. Software is being developed with this in mind (see Science\nsection). The likes of Facebook raise big questions. How does micro-targeting skew\npolitical campaigns? What biases infect facial-recognition algorithms? Better\nthey be answered with evidence instead of outrage.","The board or something like it could also act as a referee for\ncomplaints, and police voluntary data-protection protocols. Facebook, for example, is\nplanning to comply worldwide with some of the measures contained in a new\nEuropean law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. Among other\nthings, this will give users more power to opt out of being tracked online and\nto stop their information being shared with third parties. Adherence to such rules\nneeds to be closely monitored.","Thumbs\ndown","Tech has experience of acting collectively to solve problems.\nStandards on hardware and software, and the naming of internet domains, are\nagreed on jointly. Facebook's rivals may be wary but, if the industry does not come up with\na joint solution, a government clampdown will become inevitable.","Facebook seems to think it\nonly needs to tweak its approach. In fact it, and other firms that hoover up\nconsumer data, should assume that their entire business model is at risk. As\nusers become better informed, the alchemy of taking their data without paying\nand manipulating them for profit may die. Firms may need to compensate people\nfor their data or let them pay to use platforms ad-free. Profits won't come as\neasily, but the alternative is stark. If Facebook ends up as a\nregulated utility with its returns on capital capped, its earnings may drop by\n80%.

The company is facing multiple privacy investigations in the U.S. and U.K. over the leak of personal information pertaining to as many as 60 million Facebook users to voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica (see Probes Begin as Facebook Slammed by Data Leak Blowback).","Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged last week to improve privacy protections and be more transparent with users. The latest findings, however, suggest a deeper disconnect between what Facebook stores and what users expected the site to gather.","The privacy uproar over Cambridge Analytica has led some users to download their Facebook archive, a rich repository of personal information the site has cataloged. Over the last several days, those archives have yielded data users have found surprising.","Some archives show contact information that Facebook has collected from mobile phone address books. Other information included detailed call logs, such as to whom a call was made for how long and records of SMS messages. The information is metadata - data pertaining to other data, in this case concerning details of transmissions; but it does not include the content of those calls or communications.","Permission Granted?","Facebook maintains that it has always asked for permission for that kind of information, but some users say they never granted permission. The situation gained steam after a tweet last Wednesday from Dylan McKay, a software developer and student in Wellington, New Zealand.","He found call logs for every chat he had with his partner's mother between 2016 and last year. McKay has created an informal survey that's so far gathered about 1,000 responses on what type of metadata people have found in their Facebook archives.","McKay's tweet prompted others to dig around their Facebook archives. Emma Kennedy, a London-based author, writes on Twitter that she never granted permission for Facebook to collect the data she found.","I've just looked at the data files I requested from Facebook and they had every single phone number in my contacts. They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text I've sent.","\"They have plundered my phone,\" Kennedy writes in another tweet. \"They have phone numbers of people who aren't on Facebook. They have phone numbers of household names who, I'm sure, would be furious to know their phone numbers are accessible. I'm appalled.\"","Only Android Affected","It appears the surprise call logs are only showing up for Facebook users on Android devices. Apple has never allowed developers access to call logs or SMS data on iOS, in large part for security reasons, but it does allow access to the address book. Apple officials in Sydney did not have an immediate comment.","Facebook addressed the latest controversy in a blog post on Sunday. The logging of calls and text history has been an opt-in feature in Messenger since 2015 and in Facebook Lite.","Facebook Lite was launched in 2015. It's aimed at developing markets and uses less data than the full-fledged app. The company only made it available last week to users in the U.S., Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand.","Suspicion Centers on Android Messenger App","It doesn't appear that the people who are complaining that their contacts have been uploaded to Facebook and calls logged would have been able to use Facebook Lite. Hence by process of elimination, that appears to make Facebook's Messenger app the culprit.","Facebook asserts that users have always been asked for their permission. Aside from other technical explanations that have yet to emerge, that means if Facebook's characterization is accurate, forgetful memories may have fueled an unjustified outcry.","However, the publication Ars Technica suggests a different possible scenario, rooted in Android's historical permissions settings, may have occurred.","The Google-developed Android operating system allows users to give permissions to apps for certain functions. When someone downloads an app, the app asks if it is allowed to access certain data or functionality, such as a phone's camera or microphone, contacts or other information.","Over the years, as some apps became more aggressive or deceptive and security concerns emerged, Android began offering more fine-grained access permissions. But in versions of Android 4.1 and prior, granting access to a phone's contacts list also granted access to call and message logs by default, Ars reports.","That means that Facebook - when asking for contacts information - could have also received the call and SMS metadata. The permission structure, however, was changed in version 16 of the Android API.","But Ars Technica reports that Android apps could get around the change by writing to the old version of the API. The old version of the API, 4.0, was only deprecated in Android last October, it adds.","When asked about the Ars Technica report, Facebook maintains that it has always asked for permission to log call and text history even if Android did not. The company provided screen shots of the current advisories that are displayed by Android after Messenger is installed.","These are the current advisories displayed by Android after someone installs Facebook's Messenger.","While the Android advisory windows do describe some of the behaviors that Messenger would be allowed to do with contacts, calls and SMS messages, it doesn't state that the data will be stored on Facebook's servers. However, Facebook is more direct in its advisory.","The feature is headlined \"Text anyone in your phone\" and then says it will \"continuously upload info about your contacts like phone numbers and nicknames, and your call and text history.\"","Facebook's disclosure in Messenger","Questions Remain","ISMG asked Facebook if Ars Technica's theory is the reason for why users are surprised, and also asked if Facebook could clarify how it asked for permissions for past versions of the full Facebook mobile app and Messenger, but it did not receive a reply.","Asking for access to a mobile phone's address book is common among app developers because it is used to match a new user with other people they know and who use the same app. The key in this situation, however, is whether Facebook has been clear enough with users over how much data it has been collecting.","In its blog post, Facebook says it does not share call or SMS metadata with third parties.","It is possible for users to delete contacts data the social network has collected. Also, in Messenger, users can turn off a menu item that continuously uploads new contact information to the company.","Facebook also says it is possible to turn off the setting that syncs a person's call and text history.

It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda,’ because the moment you think, ‘That’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”","The executives made it clear that they worked with former intelligence agents from MI5, MI6, and Mossad who would be able to secure secret or damaging information.","“We do incognito very well indeed, in fact we have many clients who never wish to have our relationship with them made public,” Nix said on the undercover film. “We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you.”","The campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5.9 million in 2016, beginning that July. Cambridge is part owned by wealthy Republican donors the Mercers and used to count former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon among its board members.","The new disclosures surfaced after a horror morning for Mark Zuckerberg saw $40 billion wiped off the value of Facebook.","Or Cambridge Analytica would set up hidden cameras and either catch the politician saying he would accept a bribe, or the company would send in girls to seduce them.","“We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know, you know what I’m saying,” he said. “They are very beautiful. I find that works very well.”","Aside from the promise of kompromat, the executives told their prospective clients that they knew exactly how voters were thinking because of their social media access.","“Our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else, to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns… It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion,” Turnbull said.","He said Cambridge Analytica had used a few hundred thousand people’s Facebook accounts to reach out and scale up through their social networks to touch “most of America.” The company used harvested information from the accounts’ friends’ profiles as well—updates, likes, and in some cases private messages.","Facebook denies that there was any data breach, saying its privacy systems are intact and that it expects other users of that data (such as people who operate apps on the site) to abide by the same rules.","Wylie said everyone does not abide by those guidelines, even though Aleksandr Kogan, SCL and Cambridge Analytica promised that they had destroyed the data.","Facebook was reportedly informed of this alleged breach two years ago but did not go public to announce that a political consultancy linked to Bannon and the Mercers had access to details from 50 million Facebook accounts.","Instead it reportedly threatened legal action against the publications who were working with Wylie and erased his Facebook and Instagram accounts.","Dubbing himself the #millennial #whistleblower, Wylie has since taken to Twitter to joke about being deprived of access to his “daily dose of well curated food pics and thirst traps.”","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman told Channel 4 News: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever… Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”","In February 2018, Nix appeared before the Culture Media and Sport select committee in the House of Commons in London and said: “We don’t work with Facebook data, we don’t have Facebook data.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale.

From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”.

It’s no secret that today privacy doesn’t really exist, and intelligence agencies along with communications corporations have been collecting data on the global population through various means, one of them probably being Facebook. This type of data collecting and surveillance is justified by stating that it preserves national security, among other things.","“Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims, they are accomplices…Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as “surveillance companies.” Their rebranding as “social media” is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.”","That being said, it’s not like this was secret information. It’s similar to the Snowden leaks, not many people out there were labelling mass surveillance as a ‘conspiracy theory,’ there was already enough information and evidence out there to make an educated guess about it.","Recently, people have been horrified after downloading their data and info from Facebook. We’re talking about millions of people, who probably don’t really pay attention to this type of thing like we in the alternative community do. This is why there is so much shock going around right now.","They have recorded conversations, kept text messages, and much more, and at the same time they’ve been selling this data to multiple companies, and perhaps even collecting and storing it for intelligence agencies.","This all started when it was recently revealed that UK data analytics corporation, Cambridge Analytics, gained access of personal information of more than 50 million Facebook users in 2014, largely without their consent.","“Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company, got access to more than 50 million Facebook users’ data in 2014. The data was overwhelmingly collected, shared, and stored without user consent. The scale of this violation of user privacy reflects how Facebook’s terms of service and API were structured at the time. Make no mistake: this was not a data breach. This was exactly how Facebook’s infrastructure was designed to work.” (source)","Prior to leaving in 2011, Chamath Palihapitiya, the vice-president for user growth at Facebook the company, said, “The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we created are destroying how society works. . . . No civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth.”","If you don’t want to disable the platform, click “Edit” under “Apps Others Use.” Then uncheck the types of information that you don’t want others’ apps to be able to access.","Concluding Comments","Based on my research into surveillance done by governments and intelligence agencies, the reasons for invading our privacy never really seem to make sense. As mentioned above, with multiple examples, some of the reasons might even be completely fabricated. So, I encourage others to ask themselves, why? Why all of this data collection? Has Facebook, like most other high profiting corporations, simply collected data so they can sell it to other companies for huge amounts of money? Has the government intervened and used Facebook as another data collection method for their own purposes? Do they want to keep tabs on somebody that threatens the global elite’s plans in any sort of way? Or is it simply, again, all about money and finding out what we are all individually interested in?","We could go on and on and speculate, but the bottom line is, it’s not a nice feeling to know that everything you say and do is recorded and stored somewhere in a massive data base. It’s not ethical, it infringes on multiple human rights, and it seems to be completely unnecessary and a tool used by the global elite for their own selfish purposes.","One thing is for certain, the world is changing, and we’re starting to finally acknowledge what’s going on behind the scenes instead of branding facts as ‘conspiracy’ theories simply because they go against our own belief systems.","Ultimately, we are the users of these platforms, and they are detrimental in several ways as they are helpful and positive. It’s up to you to make the decision whether you want to continue to use them.","In Brief","The Facts:","Child trafficking goes far beyond the sexual abuse of children. As Robert David Steele explains, it deals with torture, ritual abuse, organ harvesting and much more. It's a big issue that needs more awareness, and the ITNJ is taking action.","Reflect On:","How did we get to the point where our 'leaders' in the most powerful positions are involved in such things? Is it appropriate to continue having them occupy high-ranking positions? Should we be supporting them? Processing our emotions is key.","Robert David Steele is a former Marine, CIA case officer and the co-founder of the US Marine Corps Intelligence Activity. His mission has been to spread the use of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), and he’s written a number of handbooks on OSINT for NATO, the DIA and US Special Operations Forces.","He has been working in these fields for decades, and definitely knows a thing or two about what’s going on at the deepest levels of government and the military industrial complex. These are the people we have to start listening to for truth. He won’t get an interview on CNN, that’s for sure.","Lately, he’s been one of several credible people from ‘within’ creating awareness and speaking out about issues that mainstream media continues to ignore, who sometimes goes as far to label as a ‘conspiracy theory,’ no matter how much evidence sits behind the claims. One of these issues is child trafficking and abuse, a topic that’s gained a lot of attention since the 2016 American election as high ranking members of the global elite have been implicated in such activity, and have been implicated in such activity for a very long time.","Only now are we seeing it creep up into the mainstream narrative, despite the fact that they continually try and shut it down. Why? Because the owners and shareholders of these networks have been implicated in the activity discussed in this article.","Beyond Simple Abuse","In the video below, Robert gives a very brief outline of the issue, and how child trafficking goes far beyond the abuse of children. It goes into organ harvesting, children being bred for ritual abuse, born without a birth certificate, tortured, enslaved, mind-controlled and a much more.","Again, this information is hitting the mainstream like it never has before, one example would be the fact that an NBC news report implicated Hillary Clinton in covering up a massive pedophile ring in the heart of the State Department, another would be multiple ex-high ranking political officials claiming that both the Clinton’s engage in sex with minors, pointing towards their close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein (who also has Royal Family connections).","Epstein is now a registered sex offender. When it comes to the Vatican, there are always disturbing acts going on. Right now, the Pope’s right-hand man, George Pell, is in court for sexual assault, and a massive pedophile ring has been exposed where hundreds of boys were tortured and sexually abused, Pope Benedict’s brother was at the forefront of that controversy.","As far as the military industrial complex goes, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney grilled Donald Rumsfeld on DynCorp about a private military contractor with ties to the trafficking of women and children. Years later, a top U.S. General who was the liaison between DynCorp and the U.S. Military was implicated in the sexual assault of teenaged girls. The list goes on and on, and it’s a long one. Oh yeah, let’s not forget about PizzaGate…","Individuals from within governments like former U.S. State Department official, Steve Pieczeni, have also been very outspoken on the subject of elite pedophile rings, and who is involved.","As Steele mentions below, ‘powerful’ organizations, like intelligence agencies for example, are not all ‘bad.’ He claims that they are filled with 90 percent good people, with good hearts and good intentions, and that the 10 percent that controls these areas are wrapped up in in-humane activity, like child trafficking.","Give the video below a listen to learn more, and you can check out more testimony from the International Tribunal on Natural Justice from others like Robert, police officers, MK Ultra survivors and many more who have knowledge of such activity.","Why Are We Learning About This?","This information can seem ‘dark’ and ‘grim,’ but how are we helping the situation if we completely ignore it and pretend it isn’t happening? It’s one thing to present this information with great judgment and anger, pushing us into a state of being and emotion that keeps us locked into lower frequencies, but it’s another thing all together to present it as neutral facts that we can become aware of so we can begin to make way for more survivors, whistleblowers and witnesses come forward to share their testimony.","When this happens, action starts to take place, like what we are seeing at the ITNJ. So, if you want to know what to do with this information, share it, and help be the voice for those who still don’t have one. Process any emotions that come from learning this information. This is how we will move through the states of consciousness that project a world that keeps this type of stuff occurring. Evolving beyond the need for it, is often about switching our perspective about it and processing the emotions.","In Brief","Robert Bigelow, founder of the Bigelow Aerospace Corporation lets the world know that he has knowledge that we are not alone, and that we are currently being visited by intelligent extraterrestrials.","Reflect On:","Bigelow is just one person, but he is joined by hundreds of others with impressive credentials. These people have been telling the world that we are not alone for years, in a very serious manner. Why do you think this is considered a 'conspiracy?'","“We have, indeed, been contacted – perhaps even visited – by extraterrestrial beings, and the US government, in collusion with the other national powers of the Earth, is determined to keep this information from the general public.” – Victor Marchetti, former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (Second Look, Volume 1, No 7, Washington, DC, May 1979)","If you’re paying attention to what’s happening in the world, it’s OK if you feel like Alice in Wonderland. For years humanity has become comfortable with their enslavement, prior to today, a large portion of the population was content with the human experience, simply entering into the system, trying to put food on the table and chase higher ‘material’ status, among other things, without ever questioning what is really happening. All of us have been engulfed in our own lives when the world is calling for us to be concerned about others.","Today, it’s a different story. There’s a massive shift in consciousness that’s occurring, and part of that shift is questioning the human experience and the systems we’ve chosen to surround ourselves with. Revelations are now coming forth in all areas that surround every aspect of human life; health and finance, to education, politics, entertainment etc… It’s quite clear that our world is not what we’ve all been presented with, and that there are aspects of reality that we should really start paying attention to if we want to grow, move forward, and break out of the cycle we currently find ourselves in. We can’t change our world if we continue to do the same things over and over again without questioning what’s happening, and why it’s happening. There are people in all fields coming forth to ‘blow the whistle,’ and witness testimony is backed up by credible evidence, which gives these whistle-blowers confidence to come forward and say what they say. Edward Snowden is one of many great examples, prior to him, mass surveillance was considered another ‘conspiracy theory.’","One big revelation hitting the mainstream right now is the fact that we are not alone, and that intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms have been visiting our planet for a long time, and still do. As unbelievable as this may sound, it comes from the highest ranking military personnel, academicians, intelligence agents, politicians, and private contractors from within the military industrial complex. There are hundreds of these people who keep telling the world that we are being visited and that governments around the world have had evidence that some of these ‘UFOs’ are indeed extraterrestrial.","“Yes, it’s both. It’s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and it’s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. And so the phenomenon stretches us, or it asks us to stretch to open to realities that are not simply the literal physical world, but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen realities from which our consciousness, our, if you will, learning processes over the past several hundred years have closed us off.”\n– Dr. John E. Mack, a Harvard University psychologist and Pulitzer prize winner (source)","The Credibility of These Sources","The sources are the most credible in the world, the only issue is, the topic. No matter how much evidence for a given phenomenon, and no matter how obvious its reality, if it goes against the human mind and what we are willing to accept, it is usually ignored or greeted with ridicule. We see the same thing with science, which has largely become dogma, the downright denial of parapsychology (telepathy, healing at a distance, etc) when it has more statistically significant results than the science used to approve most of our drugs (source). It’s called cognitive dissonance… We believe what we choose to believe, and humanity is currently in the process of shedding some belief systems in order to accept new realities that once did not fit the frame, and thus were ignored and ridiculed.","One of the latest ‘whistle-blowers’ to speak openly about their knowledge about extraterrestrial visitation is Robert Bigelow, founder of the Bigelow Aerospace Corporation. Bigelow has done work for multiple international space agencies and is currently in agreements with multiple nations to build space habitats and space stations.","Before we get to his comments, it’s important to let the reader know what type of circles Bigelow is currently ‘in’ with regards to space and the extraterrestrial/UFO question in general. Bigelow’s comments were made approximately a year ago now, but not a lot of information was given as to the type of connections this person has, if it isn’t already obvious as being one of the leading aerospace contractors in the world…","Towards the end of last year, an article titled “Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious U.F.O Program” put to rest the question of whether or not UFOs are real. CEO Tom Delonge, along with several other people, including a recently retired director of Lockheed Aerospace, Steve Justice, a Department of Defense Scientist, Hal Puthoff, a senior intelligence officer from the CIA, Jim Semivan, a Director of National Intelligence, Louis Elizondo, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and Bush Administrations, Christopher Mellon, and many more are all releasing official video footage and electro-optical data (radar trackings, returns) and letting the world know that these things (UFOs) are real.","I go into more detail regarding the latest updates in an article I published previously:","Multiple people from within this new initiative have expressed that they believe there is an extraterrestrial intelligence behind the operation of some of this craft.","This movement brought to light the Pentagon’s UFO program (AATIP) for aerial threats, one program out of what could be many, according to Hal Puthoff. You can view the entire team and their credentials here.","The main hub for all of this recent and future ‘official mainstream’ UFO disclosure is the To The Stars Academy, it’s the organization that’s releasing all of this information.","Where does Bigelow come in? Well, as the New York Times article points out:","The shadowy program – parts of it remain classified – began in 2007, and initially it was largely funded at the request of Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was the Senate majority leader at the time and who has long had an interest in space phenomena. Most of the money went to an aerospace research company run by a billionaire entrepreneur and longtime friend of Mr. Reid’s, Robert Bigelow, who is currently working with NASA to produce expandable craft for humans to use in space.","Bigelow is part of the team at To The Stars Academy, and here’s what he had to say about extraterrestrials,","“I am absolutely convinced, that’s all there is to it. There has been and is an existing presence, an ET presence.”","He also stated that we “don’t have to go anywhere” to find extraterrestrial life, that we can find it here on Earth, implying that they’re already here, walking among us, and based on my research, are already working with multiple governments.","How many races are we talking about? Perhaps hundreds, maybe even thousands of races have been catalogued by our governments worldwide.","For decades, as General Carlos Cavero told the world in 1979, “everythinghas been in a process of investigation both in the United States and in Spain, as well as the rest of the world.”On a global scale, “the nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon”and there is “an international exchange of data.”(Via Richard Donal’s UFOs for the 21st Century Mind)","A couple of years ago, longtime Bigelow Aerospace executive Mike Gold, who’s now director of Washington operations for Space Systems Loral, was asked about how Bigelow Aerospace’s’ involvement with UFOs.","He gave an intriguing answer, with some interesting expressions on his face. He mentions how he finds the subjects matter “very interesting,” and also mentions a congressional hearing where scientists emphasized that the universe is teeming with life. He goes on to state that he “cannot comment” on what Bigelow Aerospace does with UFO reports, but glad that “somebody is taking the reports because these are important issues that deserves serious attention.” (source)","Clearly, we now know that this is the case!","“An extraterrestrial influence is investigating our planet. Something is monitoring the planet and they are monitoring it very cautiously.” — 2008 Presidential Candidate, Mike Gravel (source)(source)","People Are Taking Placebo Pills To Deal With Health Problems & It’s Working","In Brief","The Facts:","People are now involved in studies where they are told they are taking a placebo medication, and it in fact is one, and they are being healed. The mainstream is finally picking up on mind-body connection.","Reflect On:","Is this the true power of our mind? Our consciousness? When we want to get better deep down, do we not make that decision in our mind and thus heal? What does this say about harmful and side effect-ridden medications?","An article published in Scientific American is a clear marker for showing just how much the mainstream has caught on to the fact that the mind-body connection is much more powerful than we previously thought, and could explain why more and more people are gravitating towards alternative forms of medicine.","A growing body of scientific research suggests that our mind can play an important role in healing our body – or in staying healthy in the first place…There are now several lines of research suggesting that our mental perception of the world constantly informs and guides our immune system in a way that makes us better able to respond to future threats. – Dr. Bruce Lipton, from The Biology of Belief","Health is one area where we can clearly see how our mind is connected to physical material reality, and how non-material science is going to play an even more important role as we move through 2018 and beyond. It’s not just health though, research in the areas of neuroscience and quantum physics is also showing how vital our thoughts, perceptions, emotions and feelings (factors associated with consciousness) are with regards to understanding the true nature of our reality.","Mind influencing matter is no longer something that’s being trivialized. There are even declassified intelligence agency documents and peer-reviewed studies that have been published that clearly show an effect at both the quantum level, and the classical mechanical level as well. If you want to learn more about this, a great place to start is with the Institute of Noetic Sciences, founded by Apollo 14 Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell.","It’s really no surprise to see this topic pop up all over mainstream media outlets, it’s a common occurrence these days. When something so spectacular gains attention and becomes so obvious, it’s almost impossible to ignore, despite the fact that its discovery has been around for decades.","Open-Label Placebo Experiment","Time magazine recently published an article about a woman (now a 71-year old medical assistant) and her struggle with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). She tried everything, from drugs to changing her diet. It was a horrible way to live, she told the Times, as she was often huddled in a corner and keeled over in pain. It’s something that can really debilitate your life. Approximately ten years ago today, she decided to enroll herself into a study, a first of its kind clinical trial, one where the patient would be receiving a placebo pill. The pill had no active ingredients, and she felt “deflated,” that she got her hopes up for nothing.","Three weeks later, after taking the pill twice daily, Buonanno (the 71-year old medical assistant) was symptom free. She had never gone so long without an attack. “I didn’t have a clue what was going on,” she says. “I still don’t.”","The placebo effect is a non-therapeutic treatment (like a sham pill), and it improves a patient’s physical condition. This has been documented for centuries. The interesting thing about the study the woman decided to participate in, is the fact that patients taking the placebo pill were well aware that they were taking a placebo. With traditional placebo studies, patients are made to believe that they are taking something that will benefit them and improve their condition. In 2009, Harvard Medical School launched the first open-label placebo, where patients knew what they were taking, and they started with people who had IBS, including the 71- year old woman. As Time points out,","The findings were surprising. Nearly twice as many people in the trial who knowingly received placebo pills reported experiencing adequate symptom relief, compared with the people who received no treatment. Not only that but the men and women taking the placebo also doubled their rates of improvement to a point that was about equal to the effects of two IBS medications that were commonly used at the time.","The team of researchers, alongside a team at the Program in Placebo Studies and Therapeutic Encounter at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, have secured a $2.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to replicate the study mentioned above. So far, researchers have treated 270 patients and intend to treat approximately 100 more with IBV via their ongoing clinical trial.","How Is This Working?","Despite the fact that the Placebo effect has been documented for well over one-hundred years, experts still can’t pinpoint what underlies this mechanism. It seems quite simple to me: it’s consciousness and the basic biology of belief. Some people argue that that the human body does not respond to treatment, but instead, the ritual of treatment. The actual pill has no effect, so what else could it be? What’s interesting is that the effect is now demonstrated even when the person knows it’s just a placebo!","There is no money in the placebo, which is why we probably haven’t heard about it much, or not enough attention is paid to it. Today, it’s well recognized in modern medicine, doctors at the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, for example, have shown that fake surgeries – slicing people’s knees open and sewing them back together without any treatment at all – provide the same improvements for people with osteoarthritis of the knee as real knee surgery.","Isn’t that remarkable?","Other Examples Of The Placebo Effect","Another example comes from a study published in 2002 by the New England Journal of Medicine which looked at surgery for patients with severe debilitating knee pain. It’s long been thought that there is no placebo effect observed in surgery, but this just isn’t true. This study divided people into three groups, for one group the surgeons saved the damaged cartilage in the knee. For another, they flushed out the knee joint by removing all of the material believed to be causing inflammation. The third group received a fake surgery, the patients were simply sedated and tricked into thinking that they actually had the surgery. All three groups went through the same rehab process, and the results were astonishing. The placebo group improved just as much as the other two groups who had the surgery.","The placebo effect should be the subject of major, funded research efforts. If medical researchers could figure out how to leverage the placebo effect, they would hand doctors an efficient, energy-based, side effect-free tool to treat disease. Energy healers say they already have such tools, but I am a scientist, and I believe the more we know about the science of the placebo, the better we’ll be able to use it in clinical settings. – Bruce Lipton, Ph.D (Taken from his book Biology of Belief – Highly recommended to learn more about this phenomenon)","A 2002 article published in the American Psychological Association’s Prevention & Treatment, conducted by University of Connecticut Psychology Professor Irving Kirsch and titled “The Emperor’s New Drugs,” made some more shocking discoveries (source)(source). Kirsch found that 80% of the effectiveness of antidepressants, as measured in clinical trials, could be attributed to the placebo effect. Kirsch even filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to get information on the clinical trials of the top antidepressants.","“The difference between the response of the drugs and the response of the placebo was less than two points on average on this clinical scale that goes from fifty to sixty points.

The data breach has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation.","House Energy and Commerce Committee spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said \"The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify\".","On the same day, Zuckerberg turned down British lawmakers' invitations to explain to a British parliamentary committee what went wrong.","The company said it would instead send one of his deputies, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.","The head of the committee called Zuckerberg's decision \"astonishing\" and urged him to think again.","Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.","AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie's remarks.

At the time I was working on the Guardian’s investigations desk, and I heard the company’s “election management” consultancy was branching out into US voter targeting with a curious new product and corporate identity. This, I would later discover, was Cambridge Analytica.","After that tip came a small cache of documents. And in December 2014, I wrote to SCL asking about its commercial relationship with a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan, and its apparent acquisition of a vast database of personal information harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users by Kogan’s company, Global Science Research (GSR). At this stage I didn’t know whose political campaign it was working on in the US. It seemed to have acquired the data, but how was it using it? I now regret putting the story on the back burner, but when SCL repeatedly refused to engage, that’s what happened. Back then, few had heard of this company.","Fast forward to autumn 2015 and a source pointed me in the direction of a Politico article that made a connection between SCL and Cambridge Analytica. By then it was offering psychological methods for targeting voters to the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. So I returned to my investigation and in December 2015 reported that SCL had paid GSR to harvest Facebook users’ data via online questionnaires. GSR boasted it owned “a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles.”","Last week, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was forced to acknowledge the privacy breach and apologise for the company’s mistakes, embarking on an uncharacteristic media blitz. Yet when I first asked Facebook about the way this data had been siphoned from the social network, the company had little to say. Apparently, it didn’t anticipate the significance the dataset would take on. But then nor did I.","Before we published that story in 2015, I had approached Facebook’s public relations representatives in London to inform them of the allegations. I asked them a series of questions, including: “Is Facebook concerned that highly personal data about a large set of its users is now being exploited for experimental political campaigning purposes?” They didn’t answer. After declining to comment on the record, they emailed a few lines on background: “Facebook has a clear data use policy that makes it clear how the information people choose to add to Facebook is used.” Their repetition of the word “clear” only made this feel more doubtful.","Hours after the story was published, Facebook’s PRs got in touch seeking more information, and later that evening I heard from the mothership itself when a senior, California-based employee emailed a statement. “We are carefully investigating this situation,” it read, “misleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do.” In time, we would come to understand just what Facebook – one of the world’s most powerful companies – meant by “swift action”.","In early 2016, I continued to investigate Cambridge Analytica, pursuing leads about its parent company, SCL, and talking to former employees and clients. I interviewed Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s then CEO and a director of SCL. He refused to say whether he was or wasn’t working in the UK on the leave campaign. (Little did I know SCL had deep ties to the digital firm AggregateIQ, as the Observer reported on Sunday, to which Vote Leave would funnel 40% of its spending.) “We’ve been talking to all sorts of political parties about different matters in the UK,” he told me. In the US, Nix said that “hundreds of thousands of people across America” had taken Cambridge Analytica’s online questionnaires, but claimed respondents’ Facebook accounts were not accessed. He was dismissive of the privacy concerns posed by political campaigns hoovering up voters’ personal data: “If the individuals wish to remain more private then they shouldn’t consent to give up their information.”","As Trump surged in the polls, Sheryl Sandberg told investors the election was 'a big deal in terms of ad spend'","As I read through Nix’s comments in my notes two years later, I am struck by the similarity between his logic and that of Facebook. In rejecting the media’s characterisation of this large-scale privacy violation as a “data breach”, Facebook claims “everyone involved” in the 2014 data-siphoning exercise had given their consent. “People knowingly provided their information,” the company claimed. As with its interpretation of the word “clear”, Facebook seems to have a skewed understanding of what “knowingly” really means.","Facebook’s senior executives may now be feeling apologetic, “outraged” even. But in January 2016, as Trump surged in the polls, Facebook’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg, told investors the 2016 election was “a big deal in terms of ad spend”. In other words, a major commercial opportunity. The ability to target voters, she said, was key: “Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those,” she boasted. “And we’re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.”","It’s perhaps worth remembering, then, that until recently Facebook was encouraging political operatives to take full advantage of its garden of surveillance. And while aspects of the Cambridge Analytica affair may be surprising, and offer a disturbing glimpse into the shadows, the routine exploitation of information about our lives – about who we are – is what’s powering Facebook. It’s the behemoth’s lifeblood."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

They suckered you into giving access to your personal data by luring you to answer personality quizzes and other seemingly benign interactive junk that Facebook throws at us.

While we believe there is still more to learn, we found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data – particularly with respect to settings for third party apps.”","It is also running a petition calling for Facebook to lock down app permission settings to ensure users’ privacy is “protected by default”, saying the current default settings “leave a lot of questions and a lot of data flying around”.","“Facebook’s current app permissions leave billions of its users vulnerable without knowing it,” it writes. “If you play games, read news or take quizzes on Facebook, chances are you are doing those activities through third-party apps and not through Facebook itself. The default permissions that Facebook gives to those third parties currently include data from your education and work, current city and posts on your timeline.","“We’re asking Facebook to change its policies to ensure third parties can’t access the information of the friends of people who use an app.”","Mozilla says it will “consider returning” to advertising on Facebook when — or presumably if — the company makes adequate changes to bolster default privacy settings.","“We are encouraged that Mark Zuckerberg has promised to improve the privacy settings and make them more protective. When Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, specifically strengthening its default privacy settings for third party apps, we’ll consider returning,” it writes. “We look forward to Facebook instituting some of the things that Zuckerberg promised today.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment on Mozilla’s action and will update this story with any response.","At the time of writing Mozilla had not responded to questions about the move.","Even setting aside the current Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data handling scandal, big privacy-related changes are incoming to Facebook thanks to the European Union’s updated data protection framework, GDPR, which will apply from May 25 to any company that processes EU citizens’ personal data.","As part of those changes — and as Facebook tries to comply with the new EU privacy standard — in January the company announced it would be rolling out a new privacy center globally that would put core privacy settings in one place. That one-stop hub is yet to launch but must arrive before May 25.","Also in January Facebook published a set of privacy principles — including grand claims that: “We help people understand how their data is used”; “We design privacy into our products from the outset”; “We work hard to keep your information secure”; “You own and can delete your information”; and “We are accountable”.","Given the last of its published principles, it will be interesting to see which executive Facebook chooses to send to testify in front of Congress — to explain things like how it failed to protect the privacy of ~50M users nor even inform people their data had been siphoned off for illicit purposes.","Asked by CNN whether he will personally testify, Zuckerberg said he will do so “if it’s the right thing to do”.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

(He didn't.)","Despite reportedly having evidence that Cambridge Analytica had illegitimately collected user data, Facebook did not suspend Cambridge Analytica until Friday — more than two years after the alleged data breach from Cambridge Analytica was first reported, and four days after The Guardian reportedly sought comment from Facebook about the story.","Facebook, for its part, doesn't call the incident a \"breach.\" A spokesperson told The Guardian: \"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it's a serious abuse of our rules.\"","So, why did Facebook suspend Wylie's account? Business Insider reached out for comment, and Facebook was not immediately available to respond.","Facebook did say on Friday that it would suspend Wylie's account — as well as the accounts of Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, and Strategic Communication Laboratories, Cambridge Analytica's parent company — while it carried out its investigation. It's unclear if Wylie's account would be restored after the investigation ends."],"isopubdate":""}

It started with the Cambridge Analytica expose, where the “dirty electioneering tricks” of this company were exposed through a sting. However, in India, as the firm was widely reported to have been engaged by the Congress, the BJP naturally questioned them about their deal. The Congress, on the other hand, has focused on attacking the BJP on the NaMo app.","Why would India’s main opposition party spend so much time and energy in attacking not the prime minister, but his app? If it is at the centre of so much attention, the app must certainly be doing something important. Narendra Modi is credited for successfully leveraging social media to reach out to people across the country. But what he is doing with the NaMo app is something unique. He has built a powerful platform, which can give any social media a run for its money.","The app provides a means for millions of his fans and party cadre to connect directly with the PM. Users can create their own profiles, earn points and win special awards for their activity. They can also connect with MPs and MLAs of their constituency. The app acts a work-flow management platform for lakhs of party workers. Even a booth worker can connect to the party president and the PM through the New India Connect section.","The app has enabled numerous path-breaking engagements. There is an Exam Warriors module where students from across the country are forming a community and also writing to the PM. For the Swachh Bharat campaign, people shared photos of their cleanliness activities. During the Gujarat elections, PM Modi had a live video interaction with Mahila Morcha workers through the app.","When a leader has risen to such level of meaningful interaction, it is only natural for the Opposition to feel insecure. Accusations have been flying, some bordering on the senseless. Rahul Gandhi tweeted that the NaMo app “secretly records audio, video, contacts of your friends and family and even tracks your location via GPS”. The absurdity of this claim, especially about the “secret audio, video recording” part, makes one wonder what the Congress is so afraid of. Does Rahul Gandhi truly not understand technology or is he just tweeting ridiculous theories to take the heat away from the Congress? Anyone who uses a smartphone knows that mobile apps request various permissions, relating to camera, microphone, etc. Do all these apps employ this for snooping?","In the NaMo app, one can browse as a guest without having to submit any details. Of course, not all sections and features will be available, which should be obvious since some activities need you to log in. But there is enough value one can extract out of the application as a guest. For example, if you had to comment on some article, you would need to log in and provide details in most applications, not just the NaMo app. If you want a customised birthday wish from Modi, you need to enter your date of birth details. It is obvious that most mobile applications ask for access to some data and NaMo app is no exception. To tailor their content to your tastes, they may ask your interests. Some made claims that the NaMo app sends data to the US. This is patently false. The app simply employs third-party services, just like Google Analytics, for analytics. All apps employ such services. Does that mean they send data to someone? No. Analytics and processing user data are done to offer users the most contextual, customised content.","To raise a stink over such analytics and ask people to delete NaMo app because “Modi is snooping on you” is amusing technological illiteracy, if not deliberate fear-mongering on the part of Rahul Gandhi. The irony is that he is relatively young and the popular perception is that the young people are more informed about technological matters.","If one needs to really worry about something, it is the privacy policy of the Congress website, which, perhaps, also applies to their mobile application. On who the Congress may share your information with, here is what it says (emphasis mine): “For making the use of Website effective and resourceful Indian National Congress may share your information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers or volunteers who are engaged by or working with us and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us; with candidates, organizations, groups or causes that we believe have similar political viewpoints, principles or objectives.”","In essence, the wording here is so vague that the Congress can possibly share your data with anyone and claim that they fall within one of these groups. For example, they can share your data with Lalu Prasad’s party because they believe they have similar political principles.","Entertainingly though, after creating much hullabaloo about getting people to delete the NaMo app through the trend, #DeleteNamoapp, the Congress ended up taking down its own mobile application and membership webpage because they found themselves indulging in the very same things, or worse. From this turn of events, there is a serious message. Rahul Gandhi and his team must realise that technological literacy, privacy awareness and data security are important issues. Making nonsensical accusations and politicising them only trivialises the debate."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","On March 17, reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London suggested Trump-campaign linked UK-based political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had been able to buy data on 50 million Facebook users in 2015 to use for microtargeting political advertising.","The data had been gathered via a third party survey app running on Facebook’s platform and using its API to pull data on the friends of the 270,000 respondents who answered the survey.","At the weekend Facebook took out full page newspaper ads in the US and UK apologizing for failing to protect users’ information.","Billions have been wiped off the company’s share price since the scandal broke.","The company’s share price also fell more than 5% today, on the news of the FTC announcement.","The consumer watchdog previously investigated Facebook over deceptive privacy claims, back in 2011.","And in 2012, as part of an FTC settlement, Facebook promised it would give users “clear and prominent notice” and get their consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.","It also agree to two decades of biennial audits.","Facebook avoided a financial penalty at the time, though if the FTC goes on to decide the company violated that earlier initial agreement it could certainly be on the hook for fines — fines which the Washington Post has suggested could scale to trillions of dollars if the FTC’s $40,000 per privacy violation is multiplied by the 50M Facebook users whose data was passed to Cambridge Analytica.","Whatever any eventual financial penalty might be, the reputational damage Facebook is suffering as a result of this snowballing data handling scandal is bad enough, adding to calls for policymakers to regulate social media platforms.","We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the FTC’s announcement — at the time of writing the company had not responded. Update: In a statement, Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer said: “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","Part of the investigation will be to see if they violated Privacy Shield, a compliance program across the US and Europe for handling user privacy and data. It’s possible that an investigation could lead to enforcement action and fines for Facebook. A representative for FTC told BuzzFeed News the agency had no additional comment on the investigation.","This isn’t the first time Facebook has been dinged by the FTC over user privacy. In 2011, Facebook and the FTC reached a settlement over charges that it deceived its users in a variety of ways, including: sharing posts that were marked “Friends Only” with third-party apps, storing data after users deleted their accounts, and sharing user data with advertisers after promising it wouldn’t. As part of the settlement, Facebook had to agree to several measures of transparency about user privacy, including \"giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings,\" preventing anyone from accessing data from deleted accounts, and getting a third-party privacy checkup every two years.","The user data taken by a researcher through a quiz app that was later sold to Cambridge Analytica happened in 2014, years after the FTC settlement. \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" according to a statement in Monday's FTC release.","Here is the full statement by Tom Pahl, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection:","The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers.

(These days, there’s not that much of a difference.)","That’s the problem with big data: It doesn’t come with signs, let alone rules, declaring CAN ONLY BE USED FOR GOOD. Once the data is out there, people will find a way to use it for whatever they want: marketing, surveillance, or propaganda.","Or, as the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global put it: “We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then, and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again,” he said. “Like a remote control. It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘that’s propaganda’, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’, the next question is, ‘who’s put that out?’”","Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies.","— Facebook","There is an absurdity here: Facebook admits it allows third-party apps to collect intimate data on its users. The only restriction is that the app creators can’t then reshare the data. In other words, the restrictions are on things that Facebook cannot possibly police proactively.","This, too, has long been Facebook’s strategy. In 2008, Facebook rolled out Facebook Beacon, a program to put invisible “web bugs” on pages across the internet. Beacon tracked Facebook users across the internet and posted their activity to their Facebook walls. Buy some baby clothes on Amazon, and it would announce the fact on Facebook, without your permission. There was an outcry, and eventually Facebook shut Beacon down.","But it didn’t give up. By splashing its Like button across the internet, by placing third-party cookies and Facebook logins on other sites, and by acquiring user data directly from third parties, Facebook continued devouring personal information. That personal information is what made Facebook a treasure trove for advertisers and marketers—and, as we now know, for Cambridge Analytica, the political microtargeting firm that helped get Donald Trump elected. An enormous industry of hundreds of firms sprung up around demographic profiling, marketing, and real-time bidding in order to sell online advertising to the right user at the right time. Facebook is the highest-profile broker for this kind of advertising, but far from the only one.","That’s why questions of illegality and terms-of-service violations are misleading. Even in the absence of violations, this sort of data collection is ubiquitous and omnivorous. Facebook would likely prefer the discussion to focus on questions of law, since United States data-sharing laws are quite lax, relying on “self-policing” by industry groups like the Network Advertising Initiative as a way to fend off actual legislation or regulation. European strategies like the “right to be forgotten” focus only on the publication of personal data rather than its initial collection—the very essence of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.","The problem, as law professor Frank Pasquale puts it in The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information, is “runaway data.” We are accustomed to thinking that once we share data with a particular entity—be it Google, Facebook, Amazon, or any one of thousands of shadowy data marketing firms—our data is somehow siloed there. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, firms are constantly sharing, selling, and coalescing data piecemeal in order to construct increasingly elaborate profiles of customers and citizens, and this data is frequently available in one form or another to anyone with the money to buy it. Entire companies like Interclick have been bought specifically for the hundreds of millions of demographic profiles they had accumulated.","If Cambridge Analytica hadn’t been able to get what it needed through Facebook, it could have gone to any number of other data brokers to get it, and then cross-referenced it to target Facebook users. If you’re a likely Trump voter, Facebook is not the only company with the evidence to prove it. Your credit card receipts, website habits, and demographic profile are frequently just as good, and there is no shortage of companies offering your data, without your permission.","Take Acxiom, a company which offers “Identity Resolution & People-Based Marketing.” In a series of articles in The New York Times, Natasha Singer explored how this veteran marketing technology company (founded in 1969) has profiled 500 million users, 10 times the 50 million that Facebook offered to Cambridge Analytica, and sells these “data products” in order to help marketers target customers based on interest, race, gender, political alignment, and more. WPP and GroupM’s “digital media platform” Xaxis has also claimed 500 million consumer profiles. Other marketing companies, like Qualia, track users across platforms and devices as they browse the web. There’s no sign-up or opt-in involved. These companies simply cyberstalk users en masse.","Even if Facebook were to seal off its data from the rest of the world, Cambridge Analytica could go to Acxiom, or any other company like it, to find the right voters and then locate them by name alone on Facebook (or elsewhere). How many of these companies would be able to tell the difference between an ordinary client using its data versus Cambridge Analytica, or even Russia? Once you’ve got a user’s data without their permission, most everything is on the table.","The only surprise is in how long it took for this data hydra to create havoc. Given the close margin of the election, it’s quite possible that Cambridge Analytica’s work (like so many other small factors) was enough to shift the election in Trump’s favor. The keys have been hanging from the door lock for over a decade, and few cared until now.","Facebook’s decision to suspend Cambridge Analytica now is little comfort. Notably, Facebook said nothing about preventing new companies from doing the same sorts of data harvesting and marketing. And even if Facebook did decide to sacrifice the revenue and somehow cut off all such activity, a peek inside Amazon, Google, Oracle, or Acxiom will reveal petabytes of similar personal data, ready to be shared, studied, and sold.","The internet was never designed for privacy, and between consumer profiling and government surveillance, there’s been little incentive to make it any more private. Cambridge Analytica’s work is not an aberration; it is an inevitability.","In 2013, I wrote of the growing threat not of Big Brother, but Big Salesman: For internet marketing companies, you are what you click. Big Salesman appears more innocuous when he’s marketing shoes and cars. Now that he’s marketing Donald Trump, we are beginning to wake up to his danger. With all our data out there, being gathered and sold by hundreds of companies, there will always be a Cambridge Analytica, a Steve Bannon, or a Vladimir Putin ready to make use of it.","David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Billed as a research vehicle for psychologists, the app, downloaded by approximately 270,000 people, asked them to share things such as content they had liked and the city they’d listed on their Facebook profile.","The social network says that Kogan passed the information to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies in violation of its rules. When it discovered this in 2015, it removed the app and asked Kogan, SCL/Cambridge Analytica, and Wylie to certify they had destroyed the data collected. All three parties said they had done so.","But according to its post, Facebook recently received reports that not all the information had been deleted. The social network says it’s looking into these claims and is suspending Kogan, Wylie, and SCL/Cambridge Analytica pending further information.","But wait, there’s more: In a related story on March 17, the New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica collected private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without permission, in what it described as “one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.” The story cites documents and former employees, including on-the-record statements from Wylie.","Why this matters: The use of social media to target political messages during the 2016 election has caused plenty of controversy. Facebook’s move will be seen as a sign it’s taking seriously accusations that it was used to manipulate public opinion, but it also raises the question of whether other data was siphoned off without the network’s knowledge."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

It’s a 5-click easy process that your grandmother can do (more details below).","Inside the .zip, lies an ‘index.html’ page that acts as a portal to your personal data. Visually, it looks like an ad-free stripped down version of Facebook that’s actually quite relaxing.","As I’m trying to reduce my exposure to social networks, I decided to take a look at this info. By extrapolating the data of a single individual (me), I might be able to better apprehend the capabilities of the beast. In the end, it all comes down to what is tracked and what can be deduced from that.","I created my account Friday, September 14, 2007 at 10:59am and all my actions have been recorded ever since. I feel that for the first time in history, 10 years of consistent human behavior have been meticulously gathered, stored & analysed.","Exhaustive photo metadata","Whenever you post a photo to Facebook, it keeps a record of all the data that’s attached to it. That seems quite obvious but I didn’t suspect it was so detailed. Have a look: Camera Maker, Model, Orientation, Exposure, F-Stop, ISO Speed, Focal Length, Latitude, Longitude & Upload IP Address","Abundant log-in & session data points","Every time you open Facebook, the time, location, IP address, browser & device have been recorded. If you’re part of the 1.4B people that use Facebook on a daily basis, they have enough data points to determine your everyday life patterns with great accuracy: home and work address, daily commute, wake up & bed time, travel duration & destination, etc.","Flawless facial recognition","Apparently, Facebook has 232 examples of what I look like.","How does it know? Well, every time you tag a photo, you’re adding to an enormous, user-driven wealth of knowledge and data. Everyday, billions of people are telling an algorithm what a human face looks like, from different angles, at different ages and in different light conditions.","The result? Facebook allegedly said that its image recognition models could recognise human faceswith 98% accuracy & that it could identify a person in one picture out of 800 million in less than five seconds.","Detailed contact list","When you install Facebook’s app on your phone, you give it the right to see your contact list. Once that’s done, Facebook keeps ALL your contacts information forever.","There’s no sneaky move here: the opt-in process on your phone is actually pretty clear about that. But seeing the phone numbers, emails & addresses of everyone you know (or knew) listed on Facebook is a bit disturbing.","Get to know your advertiser","… because he surely knows you.","Facebook main revenue source are ads served by their powerful targeting engine using custom audiences built for advertisers.","Apparently 21 advertisers got access to my Facebook information:","Playstation seems to like me a lot.","The thing is, Facebook’s been purposely mysterious about what type of information they share with third parties. Despite numerous requests by users throughout the world, their response is systematically:","Advertisers do not give Facebook any users’ contact details. We only get such details in hashed form and they are, in any event, deleted within 48 hours. We are therefore not able to confirm what contact information an advertiser has for a particular user.","But looking at Facebook Business platform provides some details about what info is used in custom audiences targeting: email, phone number, first name, last name, city, state, country, date of birth, age & gender.","So Facebook has a lot of data about you & it shares it with a lot of advertisers: but why should you care?","“Bring the world closer…”","… to ads.","I used to think there was no real drawback in ceding a lot of personal data to a 3rd party. After all, I get a free service that’s pleasant to use & really helpful.","Eventually, I realised that the harm potential really depends on 2 factors: the intentions & means of action of the organisation that harvests your data.","Harm potential = money * financial KPI’s — regulatory pressure.","That’s where Facebook gets really frightening: it’s hugely powerful & its only objective is to maximise the time spent & interactions made with its platform (just look at its financial KPI’s).","Don’t be fooled by the “bring the world closer together” motto: if Facebook’s here, it’s only to make money by selling ads. And to do that, they must target — in the most precise manner — the highest possible amount of eyeballs.","The thing is, do we really care?","How to get your data?","Starting with Facebook in 2010 and followed by Google and Twitter in 2011 and 2012, big social networks began allowing their users to download a backup file of everything they’ve ever posted.","To download your Facebook backup, just follow the 3 steps described here. Facebook will send you an email once your backup’s ready (it usually takes less than 10 minutes).","For a more holistic approach, check out PersonalData.io. It’s a web service that‘s helping individuals get a hold on their personal data. They’re doing an awesome job referencing data controllers & providing request templates filled with the correct wording & legal jargon. They then publish the requests & answers online so that everyone can appreciate corporate lawyers’ talent for complexifying exchanges & dodging questions.","Dig deeper","Most facts presented in this article are sourced from these reports & websites.If you wish to learn more or make your own opinion, I think they’re a good starting point."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-11"}

Now, the European Union wants to change that.","ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:","The European Commission has outlined a plan to change the system of taxation for large Internet companies. The argument is that huge digital companies like Google and Amazon have been paying an unfair, low tax rate in Europe. Most of the biggest firms are American, and they say they're being unfairly targeted at a time when transatlantic tensions are already strained. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports from Paris.","ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: With 500 million well-connected consumers, the European Union is a lucrative market place for Internet companies. But European leaders say large digital firms like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are not paying their share of taxes. In a recent interview with NPR, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that has to change.","(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)","BRUNO LE MAIRE: We want to ensure fair taxation for everybody. I'm asking the small and medium-sized French companies to pay their due taxes either in France or in Europe. I just want to ask the same to the Internet giants. They have to pay their taxes like any other private company.","BEARDSLEY: The EU complains that foreign Internet companies do most of their business in large countries like Germany, France and Britain, yet locate their headquarters in small, low-tax countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg. Peter Chase studies at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels. He says the EU is looking to change the basis of corporate taxation.","PETER CHASE: They want to say that if a company does a lot of digital business, if it works like a marketplace to bring people together and then gets a fee for that, if they do all that business in their territory, then that should be enough to say they have a significant digital presence.","BEARDSLEY: And so that's where the EU thinks companies should pay their taxes, says Chase.","(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)","PIERRE MOSCOVICI: (Speaking French).","BEARDSLEY: Last week, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of taxation, said in the last 20 years, the digital revolution has up-ended economies and changes the way companies create value. He told journalists tax law needs to keep up with those changes.","(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)","MOSCOVICI: That those companies pay in the EU something like 9 percent whilst the rest of the economy pays 23 percent. And people don't accept that. That's why we are acting now decisively.","BEARDSLEY: Moscovici says until the EU can make permanent changes to the way Internet companies are taxed, it will create a temporary solution, a 3 percent tax on digital company revenues, which will raise about 5 billion euros a year.","(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)","MOSCOVICI: This interim solution will focus on turnover from activities where user participation plays a central role in value creation, meaning most of the digital services we use in our daily life.","BEARDSLEY: Moscovici said in order to avoid damaging startups, the measure will concentrate on large Internet firms. But he insisted the EU is not targeting American companies.","(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)","MOSCOVICI: This is not an anti-American approach. It is not an anti-American tax.","BEARDSLEY: Moscovici said about 150 companies will be affected by this tax and only half are American. Not all EU members are likely to be on board in changing the basis of corporate taxation, says Chase.","CHASE: Small countries that are really adept at technologies, these are the ones that are going to have a problem with the redistribution of what should be their government revenues to big countries like Germany.","BEARDSLEY: With so many conflicting points of view, Chase says it might take a long time to get approval from all 27 EU member states.

The report, based on former employees, associates and documents, alleges Cambridge Analytica used the data to target voters during the 2016 presidential election.","Global Science's Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, gained access to the personal information of 270,000 Facebook users in 2013 after they chose to download his app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” which billed itself as a research app used by psychologists. The information included hometown, content the users liked and their friends.","The app also collected information from people's friends. According to the New York Times, 30 million of those profiles had enough information to match users to other records and build profiles of them. Facebook declined to comment on the number of accounts whose information was shared.","Cambridge Analytica still has most of all of the data collected from Facebook user profiles, which includes details about users' identities, their friends and \"likes,\" according to the report.","The newspaper says, when contacted, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether Cambridge Analytica still had any of the data before releasing its statement late Friday. An editor with the Guardian-owned Observer tweeted that Facebook threatened to sue the company ahead of publication.","Facebook pointed to a tweet by senior executive Andrew Bosworth, previously vice president of ads, who took issue with the Times' description of Cambridge Analytica's alleged exploit as a breach or data leak. \"People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation.\"","In a statement Saturday, Cambridge Analytica said that it fully complied with Facebook's terms of service and is working with the social media giant to resolve the matter.","\"No data from (Global Science Research) was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the company said in a statement.","\"Cambridge Analytica only receives​ and use​s​ data that has been obtained legally and fairly,\" it said.","When asked to comment on the newspapers' reports, it responded with a letter a law firm had sent on its behalf to the Observer reporter, where it sought to contradict the statements of a former staffer profiled as a whistle blower in the Observer's coverage.","The Trump campaign denied using voter data from Cambridge Analytica, saying it relied on data from the Republican National Committee.","Cambridge Analytica, backed by top Trump donor and hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, claims it can predict how people will vote based on the 5,000 pieces of data it collects on nearly every American adult combined with the results of thousands of personality surveys. Enlisted by the Trump campaign, it touted its role as swinging the presidential election.","How it worked: by asking users to download a personality quiz app","Facebook said a British researcher and his firm, Global Science Research, legitimately gained access to the personal data of Facebook users in 2013 while working on a personality prediction app, but the researcher violated Facebook’s rules by passing it on to Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was asked in December to turn over documents to special counsel Robert Mueller, as part of his investigation into collusion between the campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","In 2015, Facebook learned that the researcher Kogan broke its policies by passing on the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. Facebook says it was assured the information had been deleted, but received reports several days ago that it was not.","Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica is the whistleblower profiled by The Observer. He set up Eunoia Technologies after leaving Cambridge Analytica in late 2014.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” Facebook’s deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said in the Friday blog post. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.”","Facebook said it has suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie. Kogan and Wylie could not be reached for comment.","Facebook denies the harvesting of Facebook profiles constitutes a data breach, which would require Facebook to notify users in many states, including California where it's headquartered.","In a now deleted tweet, Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos said Saturday: \"Kogan did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, or use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed. He did, however, misuse that data after he gathered it, but that does not retroactively make it a 'breach.'\"","The Web Foundation, set up by Tim Berners-Lee to advocate for an open Internet, called for a full investigation and for all affected users to be notified. The Web Foundation also wants to know why Facebook didn't ban Cambridge Analytica sooner and what actions Facebook takes when a third party violates its rules.","\"Today’s story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica drives home why we need platforms to be fully transparent and accountable in the age of big data. Once our personal data is in someone else’s hands, it’s extremely difficult to take back control — with potentially disastrous results for public safety, discourse and democracy,\" Web Foundation's policy director Craig Fagan in a statement. \"Platforms must fully embrace their responsibility to do whatever it takes to keep user data safe from abuse.","In the fall, Mueller asked Cambridge Analytics to turn over emails of employees who worked on the Trump campaign, signaling the special counsel is probing the data operation.","Former senior White House strategist Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors and had a stake in the firm.","Mueller is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with Russian operatives to meddle in the election. Trump has denied he or his campaign colluded. The Russian government has denied meddling in the election.","Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence panel, called for regulation of online political advertising, calling it \"essentially the Wild West.\"","The Federal Election Commission on Wednesday agreed to begin writing new disclosure rules for online ads as regulators wrestle with how to prevent foreign interests from influencing U.S. elections.","The new rules may not be in place for the 2018 midterm elections and won't cover all political ads, including ads Russian operatives used to meddle in the 2016 presidential contest.","\"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,\" Warner said in a statement. \"This is another strong indication of the need for Congress to quickly pass the Honest Ads Act ​to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.\" ​"],"isopubdate":""}

I heard it most recently on\nlast week's Slate \"Political Gabfest\" podcast, where the\ncohost David Plotz brought it up in relation to the\nFacebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal.","It struck me as an especially important phrase to remember in the\nera of \"free\" internet services.

The gathering was called in response to Republican outrage over a report that contractors for Zuckerberg’s company were suppressing conservative articles from its “trending” section.","At least one conservative organization invited told Facebook to take a hike. On Monday afternoon Breitbart News, widely seen as the most pro-Trump news outlet of the election, said the social media company had reached out but declared it had “zero interest in a Facebook photo-op”.","Breitbart editors, which rely heavily on Facebook traffic for their articles, said they were more interested in Zuckerberg doing a live interview with their technology editor “on the topic of free speech and Facebook’s suppression of conservative media”.","Facebook’s damage control efforts illustrate the challenge Zuckerberg faces as he seeks to become more involved in politics while continuing to grow Facebook into a global commons for people of all political stripes. Since the 2012 presidential election, Zuckerberg has taken an increased interest in public advocacy, particularly on America’s immigration laws. At a developer conference last month, he lamented politicians who call for “building walls”, perhaps the signature policy proposal of Trump’s campaign.","Facebook has denied the allegation that it told contractors to suppress conservative news and no other media outlet has confirmed the story by Gizmodo – based on a single, unnamed source – that set off the controversy. Several people close to the company, who also declined to speak on record, argued that if bias was being inserted into the trending section, it came from Facebook’s part-time news curators acting on their own.","Regardless, conservatives adopted the idea that Facebook is biased as the latest data point that mainstream media leans left. In the week since, the Republican party chairman, Reince Priebus, has accused Facebook of censorship and a leading Senate Republican has opened an inquiry.","As Facebook enters its second week of damage control, the veracity of the report arguably no longer matters.","And to be sure, many conservatives remain active on Facebook. Beck, the popular radio host, first announced details of the meeting in a Sunday post on Zuckerberg’s service.","“I am trying to rearrange my schedule to see if I can make it,” Beck wrote. “It would be interesting to look him in the eye as he explains and a win for all voices if we can come to a place of real trust with this powerful tool.”","As of Monday afternoon, the post had 6,500 “likes” or other reactions and 1,300 comments.","In his Facebook post, Beck acknowledged the controversy also illustrates a tension in conservative doctrine. On the one hand, those on the right argue the news-entertainment complex attempts to censor their beliefs. On the other, they argue government has no right to tell private companies how to run their businesses.","“In fact, if he had the balls to tell me that he was courting me due to pressure groups I would disagree with his business plan but join him in the fight to make his own decisions with his company against the pressure groups,” Beck wrote of the Facebook CEO. “I will stand for any man’s right to be truly free and run his business the way he sees fit.”"],"isopubdate":"2016-05-16"}

You'll get a file with every photo and comment you've posted, all the ads you've clicked on, stuff you've liked and searched for and everyone you've friended — and unfriended — over the years.","Chuck Goolsbee, site director for Facebook's Prineville data centers, shows the computer servers that store users' photos and other data, at the Facebook site in Prineville, Ore. Facebook frequently defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it's adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. (Andy Tullis/The Bulletin via AP, File)","The Facebook Data Center in Prineville, Ore. Facebook frequently defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it's adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users.","March 26, 2018","Now, the company is under fire for collecting data on people's phone calls and text messages if they used Android devices. While Facebook insists users had to specifically agree, or opt in, to have such data collected, at least some users appeared surprised.","Facebook's trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you. It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable — say, by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed, or reminding you of friends' birthdays.","Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that's relatively clear and concise. But few users bother to read it. You might be surprised at what Facebook's privacy policy allows — and what's left unsaid.","Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users. While past privacy debacles have centered on what marketers gather on users, the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.","Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it's adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators, Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used — to a point.","You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead, the way you would on television or in a newspaper. In the ad settings, you'd need to uncheck all your interests, interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don't want to use in targeting. Of course, if you click on a new interest after this, you'll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting. It's a tedious task.","As Facebook explains, it puts you in target categories based on your activity. So, if you are 35, live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page, Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area.","But activity isn't limited to pages or posts you like, comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites. \"If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too,\" Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent techno-sociologist, said in a 2017 TED talk.","And, increasingly, Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data, purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways. The more information it has, the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers. It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing — anything from your ethnicity to personality traits, happiness and use of addictive substances, Tufekci said.","These types of data collection aren't necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings. What Facebook does say is that advertisers don't get the raw data. They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach, then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads.","Apps can also collect a lot of data about you, as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.","Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately — but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling. Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time, even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent.","Ian Bogost, a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue-in-cheek game called \"Cow Clicker\" in 2010, wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for \"deliberately nefarious ends\" was easy to do then. What's worse, he said, it was hard to avoid extracting private data.","If \"you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior,\" he wrote. \"I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood.\"","Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access. But other types of data collection are still permitted. For this reason, it's a good idea to check all the apps you've given permissions to over the years. You can also do this in your settings."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Tech companies like Google, Twitter, and especially Facebook, have been hammered with criticism from a large portion of the population — including lawmakers — for purportedly helping Trump win the 2016 election with the platform’s inherent offerings. How much social media campaigns actually had an effect on election results appears dubious, or at least unclear, and may not even be quantifiable. What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization. (RELATED: Here Are Two Of The Russian-Bought Facebook Ads That ‘Helped Sway The Election’)","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Severalreports, including The NYT’s one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.” But as noted by Grewal in an update made Satuday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”","Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Read More","NEW DELHI: Facebook is in a lot of trouble because of the recent\nCambridge Analytica data scandal\n+ However, it seems that the social media giant’s woes aren’t going to end anytime soon. Recently, it was discovered that Facebook tracks its users online and also collect their personal information which even includes the text messages and the call logs.","Users, however, can now prevent this with the help of a Mozilla Firefox extension, which stops Facebook from keeping a track of the online habits of its users. The extension named Facebook Container, creates a blue coloured browser tab which isolates your Facebook session with other activities on the web. This will make it difficult for Facebook to keep a track of users’ online activities. This means if you are planning for a trip and are searching for it online, then your Facebook newsfeed will not be flooded with the ads from other brands.","In an official blog post, Mozilla said, “The pages you visit on the web can say a lot about you. They can infer where you live, the hobbies you have, and your political persuasion. There’s enormous value in tying this data to your social profile, and Facebook has a network of trackers on various websites. This code tracks you invisibly and it is often impossible to determine when this data is being shared.”","The company feels that this is a better solution than deleting Facebook as it gives users tools that help them protect themselves from the unexpected side effects of their usage.","Earlier today it was reported that Facebook has been slapped with three lawsuits on the same issue. Three users of the Facebook Messenger app sued the company, saying the social network violated their privacy by collecting logs of their phone calls and text messages, in the latest legal challenge facing the company.","Connect with us","All Comments (0)+^ Back to Top","Characters Remaining: 3000","Continue without login","or","Login from existing account","FacebookGoogleEmail","Share on FacebookShare on Twitter","Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

(AFP File Photo)","The firm, Cambridge Analytica (CA), and its India partner, Oveleno Business Intelligence (OBI) Private Limited, have spoken to both the Congress and the BJP for a possible collaboration for their 2019 Lok Sabha election campaigns, said one of the people quoted above.","CA, which played an important role in US President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, was on Friday suspended by Facebook. The New York Times and The Observer reported the following day that CA “harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission”, quoting its former employees, associates and documents.","The firm denied it had violated Facebook’s rules. A statement by CA said its “robust data protection policies complied with US, international, EU and national regulations”.","The recent allegations will not deter the firm and its India partner from continuing their collaboration till CA is found to “violate Indian law”, OBI’s CEO Amrish Tyagi said on Sunday.","According to a person familiar with the firm, it has had talks with the Congress and the BJP, with former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is making a bid to get re-elected in 2020, and with the Awami League, the ruling party in Bangladesh, which is seeking re-election in 2019.","“Nothing is confirmed yet. These are all preliminary talks,” said the person quoted above.","“We are in touch with Cambridge Analytica on the controversy. Their officials have denied the allegations and are exploring legal options. Nothing has been established yet,” Tyagi said. “We are partners. If something is established to be in violation of Indian law, then we will of course reconsider it.”","He said the social media legislation and regulation was complex and diverse in different jurisdictions. “What may be illegal and unethical in one place may not be in India and vice versa. So it is too early to say anything.” On its website, CA says it was contracted for an in-depth electorate analysis for the Bihar assembly elections in 2010. “Our client achieved a landslide victory, with over 90% of total seats targeted by CA being won,” it adds.","Tyagi, who is the son of the senior JD(U) leader and former Rajya Sabha MP KC Tyagi, worked for the JD(U)-BJP alliance in Bihar in 2010 through OBI. He then worked with the BJP, when Nitin Gadkari was party president, in Uttar Pradesh in 2012. OBI primarily does booth-level work for parties, looking at demographics and caste to bolster a party’s prospects on the ground, said Tyagi, who also worked on the Trump campaign’s outreach to the Indian-American community.","“Through OBI, I have worked with individual candidates, including in the UP assembly elections of 2017. But Cambridge has not yet done any political project here.” When asked if they had conducted a similar profiling of Facebook users, he said, “Not at all. Cambridge does not have any project here. There is no question of having done social media work.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

In January, reports surfaced that Portal might launch this year, but yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Facebook won't be unveiling its home products at its F8 developer conference in May as was initially planned. The pullback is attributed to the ongoing Cambridge Analytica controversy and growing concerns over how Facebook handles its users' data. Now, The Information reports that the company is also considering alternative privacy safeguards among its smart home devices.","According to The Information, Facebook now plans to limit the processing and storing of video data to the device itself instead of on its servers.

No good attorney would,' said Avenatti.","'There's gonna be a lot of evidence that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here.'","This includes the identify of the individual who allegedly threatened Daniels back in 2011 and how she received her reported $130,000 payout after signing a non-disclosure agreement two weeks before the election.","Share this article","Avenatti said that while President Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen may have cut the check for $130,000, he is not the person who ultimately covered that sizable payout.","'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' stated Avenatti.","'Regardless, Mr Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement.'","He addressed the individual who threatened his client seven years ago as well, soon after she detailed her alleged one-night stand with President Trump in an interview.","'It had to have come from someone associated with Mr. Trump,' explained Avenatti.","'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client.'","When asked if his client told anyone or went to the police after that threat, Avenatti responded: 'She was scared. No.'","It was then pointed out that this might make the story difficult to stand up, which Avenatti denied, saying: 'I don't think so. I think we're going to get to the bottom of this. The threat, the agreement, the bottom of the $130,000 payment.'","Daniels' lawyer also said at one point that President trump had never denied the affair, a claim which was met with immediate push back as it was pointed out there have been many denials.","'Well actually, the president has never denied it. He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known the mankind. For some reason, he can't deny the affair,' said Avenatti.","'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment.

You remind me of my daughter.\" You know - he was like, \"You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,\"' said Daniels.","Similar tales: Daniels interview came just a few days after former Playmate Karen McDougal (above with Trump in 2006) made similar claims","The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex.","He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.","Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.'","After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice.","She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.","'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.","In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to.","Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.","When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'","She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.","'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, \"Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,\"' said Daniels.","'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'","Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two.","'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper.","'I asked.

We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels.","Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.","McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.","The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.","Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.","Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.","A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office.","THE TRANSCRIPT: STORMY DANIELS SPILLS ALL ABOUT HER ALLEGED AFFAIR WITH DONALD TRUMP ON 60 MINUTES","Stormy Daniels (pictured) told all about her alleged affair with Donald Trump","Anderson Cooper: For sitting here talking to me today you could be fined a million dollars I mean aren't you taking a big risk?","Stormy Daniels: I am.","Anderson Cooper: I guess I'm not 100% sure on why you're doing this.","Stormy Daniels: Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself","Anderson Cooper: Is part of talking w-- wanting to set the record straight?","Stormy Daniels: 100%.","Anderson Cooper: Why does the record need to be set straight?","Stormy Daniels: Because people are just saying whatever they wanted to say about me, I was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I'm not okay with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, \"Oh, you're an opportunist.

There's-- it's gonna be spectacular, they're totally into the idea,\" and I was like mhmm that part I never believed.","Anderson Cooper: Did you still get the sense that he was kind of dangling it in front of you--","Stormy Daniels: Oh, for sure, oh yeah.","Anderson Cooper: To keep you interested, to keep you coming back.","Stormy Daniels: Of course, of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?","Anderson Cooper: Did you view it as this is a potential opportunity. \"I'm gonna see where it goes?\"","Stormy Daniels: I thought of it as a business deal.","In July 2007 -- a year after they met -- Daniels says Mr. Trump asked to meet with her privately at his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles to discuss a development regarding her possible appearance on Celebrity Apprentice.","Stormy Daniels: I remember arriving, and he was watching Shark Week. He made me sit and watch an entire documentary about shark attacks.","Anderson Cooper: It wasn't at that point a business meeting, it was just watching Shark Week.","Stormy Daniels: Yeah.","Anderson Cooper: Did you have sex with him again?","Stormy Daniels: No.","Anderson Cooper: Did he want to?","Stormy Daniels: Yes.","Anderson Cooper: How do you know he wanted to?","Stormy Daniels: Because he came and sat next to me and, you know, touched my hair, and put his hand on my leg, and r-- referenced back to how great it was the last time.","Anderson Cooper: How did you get out of it?","Stormy Daniels: Well, I'd been there for, like, four hours. And so I then was like, \"Well, before, you know, can we talk about what's the development?\" And he was like, \"I'm almost there. I'll have an answer for you next week.\" And I was like, \"Okay, cool. Well-- I guess call me next week.\" And I just took my purse and left.","According to Daniels, Mr. Trump called her the following month to say he'd not been able to get her a spot on Celebrity Apprentice. She says they never met again and only had sex in that first meeting in 2006. In May 2011, Daniels agreed to tell her story to a sister publication of In Touch magazine for $15,000 dollars. Two former employees of the magazine told us the story never ran because after the magazine called Mr. Trump seeking comment, his attorney Michael Cohen threatened to sue. Daniels says she was never paid, and says a few weeks later, she was threatened by a man who approached her in Las Vegas.","Stormy Daniels: I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter. T-- taking, you know, the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper bag, you know, gettin' all the stuff out. And a guy walked up on me and said to me, \"Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.\" And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, \"That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.\" And then he was gone.","Anderson Cooper: You took it as a direct threat?","Stormy Daniels: Absolutely.","Stormy Daniels: I was rattled. I remember going into the workout class. And my hands are shaking so much, I was afraid I was gonna-- drop her.","Anderson Cooper: Did you ever see that person again?","Stormy Daniels: No. But I-- if I did, I would know it right away.","Anderson Cooper: You'd be able to-- you'd be able to recognize that person?","Stormy Daniels: 100%. Even now, all these years later. If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know.","Anderson Cooper: Did you go to the police?","Stormy Daniels: No.","Anderson Cooper: Why?","Stormy Daniels: Because I was scared.","When a gossip website reported a few months later that she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump, Stormy Daniels publically denied it. Five years later, Donald Trump won the Republican nomination for president.","Stormy Daniels: Suddenly people are reaching out to me again, offering me money. Large amounts of money. Was I tempted? Yes-- I struggle with it. And then I get the call. \"I think I have the best deal for you.\"","Anderson Cooper: From your lawyer?","Stormy Daniels: Yeah.","The deal was an offer not to tell her story. It came from Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen. In return for signing this non-disclosure agreement, Cohen would pay her $130,000 dollars through a Delaware-based limited liability corporation he had established in mid-October 2016 called essential consultants. Daniels says the agreement was appealing because it meant she would receive some money but also not have to worry about the effect the revelation of the affair would have on her child who was now old enough to watch the news. She signed the agreement eleven days before the election.","Anderson Cooper: Was it hush money to stay silent?","Stormy Daniels: Yes. The story was coming out again. I was concerned for my family and their safety.","Anderson Cooper: I think some people watching this are going to doubt that you entered into this negotiation-- because you feared for your safety. They're gonna think y-- that you saw an opportunity.","Stormy Daniels: I think the fact that I didn't even negotiate, I just quickly said yes to this v-- very, you know, strict contract. And what most people will agree with me extremely low number. It's all the proof I need.","Anderson Cooper: you feel like if you had wanted to go public, you could have gotten paid a lot of money to go public--","Stormy Daniels: Without a doubt. I know for a fact. I believe, without a shadow of a doubt, in my heart, and some people argue that I don't have one of those, but whatever, that I was doing the right thing. I turned down a large payday multiple times because one, I didn't wanna kiss and tell and be labeled all the things that I'm being labeled now. I didn't wanna take away from the legitimate and legal, I'd like to point out, career that I've worked very hard to establish. And most importantly, I did not want my family and my child exposed to all the things that she's being exposed to right now. because everything that I was afraid of coming out has come out anyway, and guess what? I don't have a million dollars. (LAUGH) You didn't even buy me breakfast.","Anderson Cooper asked Daniels whether she was 'taking a big risk' speaking to him","15 months after she signed the non-disclosure agreement, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal published this story, quoting anonymous sources, saying that Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen had paid her for her silence. Daniels says she was not the source of the story. But once it was published, she says she was pressured by her former attorney and former business manager to sign statements that Michael Cohen released publically, denying she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump.","Anderson Cooper: So you signed and released-- a statement that said I am not denying this affair because I was paid in hush money I'm denying it because it never happened. That's a lie?","Stormy Daniels: Yes.","Anderson Cooper: If it was untruthful, why did you sign it?","Stormy Daniels: Because they made it sound like I had no choice.","Anderson Cooper: I mean, no one was putting a gun to your head?","Stormy Daniels: Not physical violence, no.","Anderson Cooper: you thought that there would be some sort of legal repercussion if you didn't sign it?","Stormy Daniels: Correct. As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was, \"They can make your life hell in many different ways.\"","Anderson Cooper: They being…","Stormy Daniels: I'm not exactly sure who they were. I believe it to be Michael Cohen.","President Trump's attorney Michael Cohen has denied ever threatening Stormy Daniels. The payment Cohen made to her is now the subject of complaints to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission, alleging that it was an illegal campaign contribution.","What makes the dispute between Stormy Daniels and the president more than a high-profile tabloid scandal is that her silence was purchased eleven days before the presidential election, which may run afoul of campaign finance laws. The president's long-time lawyer Michael Cohen says he used $130,000 of his own money to pay Stormy Daniels. Cohen has said the money was not a campaign contribution. But Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission appointed by President George H.W. Bush, told us he doesn't agree.","Trevor Potter: The payment of the money just creates an enormous legal mess for I think Trump, for Cohen and anyone else who was involved in this in the campaign.","Anderson Cooper: Are you saying that can be seen as a contribution to benefit a campaign?","Trevor Potter: I am. it's a $130,000 in-kind contribution by Cohen to the Trump campaign, which is about $126,500 above what he's allowed to give. And if he does this on behalf of his client, the candidate, that is a coordinated, illegal, in-kind contribution by Cohen for the purpose of influencing the election, of benefiting the candidate by keeping this secret.","The payment Stormy Daniels received is the subject of complaints by watchdog groups to the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission, which Trevor Potter used to be chairman of. He's now president of the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center, which supports the enforcement of campaign finance laws.","Anderson Cooper: If the president paid Michael Cohen back, is that an in-kind campaign contribution that the president should've then reported?","Trevor Potter: It is. If he was then reimbursed by the president, that doesn't remove the fact that the initial payment violated Cohen's contribution limits. I guess it mitigates it if he's paid back by the candidate because the candidate could have paid for it without limit.","Anderson Cooper: What if the president never reimbursed Michael Cohen?","Trevor Potter: Then he is still out on the line, having made a illegal in-kind contribution to the campaign.","Anderson Cooper: You're saying this is more serious for Michael Cohen if the president did not pay him back?","Trevor Potter: Yes. I think that's correct.","We wanted to speak with Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen about this, but he did not respond to our calls and written request for comment. Cohen told The New York Times last month he used his own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Stormy Daniels and said, \"Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump Campaign… reimbursed me for the payment.\" this past week, Cohen told Vanity Fair magazine, \"What I did defensively for my personal client, and my friend, is what attorneys do for their high-profile clients. I would have done it in 2006. I would have done it in 2011. I truly care about him and the family -- more than just as an employee and an attorney.\"","Michael Avenatti: It's laughable. It's ludicrous. It's preposterous.","Anderson Cooper: Lawyers don't do that, you're saying. You-- you--","Michael Avenatti: Ever.","Michael Avenatti is Stormy Daniels' attorney. He's a Los Angeles trial lawyer who is suing the president in a California court, seeking to have Stormy Daniels' non-disclosure agreement -- or \"NDA\" -- declared invalid, in part because the president never signed it on the lines provided for his alias -- \"D.D.,\" David Dennison.","Anderson Cooper: Michael Cohen has said, \"Look, this had nothing to do with the election.\" He would've made this agreement months before.","Michael Avenatti: So why didn't he? It just slipped his mind? It's just a coincidence that, in the waning days of the campaign, he thought to himself, \"Oh, you know, I know I've been thinkin' about this for years. Perhaps now is a good time to get that NDA executed with Stormy Daniels.\"","Avenatti disputes the notion that Cohen was working in a purely personal capacity when he arranged the hush money for Stormy Daniels. He's found documents that show Michael Cohen used his Trump Organization email address in setting up the payment. He also says the non-disclosure agreement Stormy Daniels signed in 2016, when she was represented by a different lawyer, was FedExed to Cohen at his Trump Organization office in Trump Tower in New York.","Michael Avenatti: That is a copy of the Federal Express confirmation","The cover letter from Daniels' previous attorney also identifies who he thought Michael Cohen was working for.","Michael Avenatti: To Mr. Cohen as executive vice president and special counsel to Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization, again-- listing the 5th Avenue address. this idea that there's a separation now between Mr. Cohen, individually, and the Trump Organization or Mr. Cohen, individually, and Donald Trump, it-- it-- it's nonsense.","Anderson Cooper: There are people who argue that this much ado about nothing, that if this was not a story about, an adult film actress and the President of the United States, no one would pay attention.","Michael Avenatti: This is about the cover-up. This is about the extent that Mr. Cohen and the president have gone to intimidate this woman, to silence her, to threaten her, and to put her under their thumb. It is thuggish behavior from people in power. And it has no place in American democracy.","Avenatti points to this recent court filing in which the president's lawyers claim Daniels is already liable for damages \"in excess of $20 million\" for unspecified violations of her non-disclosure agreement. And in that article in Vanity Fair this past week, Michael Cohen said that when he wins damages from Stormy Daniels, \"I might even take an extended vacation on her dime.\"","Anderson Cooper: You're saying they're tryin' to intimidate her.","Michael Avenatti: There's no question. You threaten someone-- with a $20 million lawsuit, it's a thuggish tactic. It's no different than what happened in the parking lot in Las Vegas.","Anderson Cooper: People make threats in lawsuits all the time. People, you know, say, \"You're gonna have to pay a lot of money when you lose this-- this case.\"","Michael Avenatti: People don't threaten people with $20 million lawsuits, that they're gonna take their home and take an extended vacation on the money they receive. People don't conduct themselves like this. They don't. And they shouldn't.","Anderson Cooper: Stormy Daniels did sign the agreement. She got $130,000. Isn't she welching on a deal?","Michael Avenatti: No, she's not welching on a deal, 'cause there never was a deal.","Anderson Cooper: But she still took the money.","Michael Avenatti: She took the money. But the fact of the matter is Mr. Trump never signed the agreement. He was obligated to sign the agreement in order for the agreement to spring into effect.","That's not true, according to Michael Cohen, who has said only his signature was required. What was also required under the non-disclosure agreement was for Stormy Daniels to turn over all \"video images, still images, email messages, and text messages,\" she had regarding Mr. Trump.","Anderson Cooper: Did you do that?","Stormy Daniels: I can't answer that right now.","Anderson Cooper: You don't want to say one way or the other if you have text messages or other items?","Stormy Daniels: My attorney has recommended that I don't discuss those things.","Anderson Cooper: You seem to be saying that she has some sort of text message, or video, or-- or photographs. Or you could just be bluffing.","Michael Avenatti: You should ask some of the other people in my career when they've bet on me bluffing.","Anderson Cooper: In college and law school, you did opposition research for Democratic political operative Rahm Emanuel. Some people looking at that would say you're politically motivated,","Michael Avenatti: I haven't done anything in politics in over 20 years.","Anderson Cooper: But this is not the usual case you take on. You were a former Democratic operative. And you're talking about deposing the president. That sounds political.\"","Trevor Potter, the former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, says the agency's investigations often take a long time and usually result only in monetary penalties. But there is another scenario that could present a problem for the president: special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In March, the Washington Post reported that the \"special counsel has examined episodes involving Michael Cohen,\" including his efforts to launch a Trump-branded project in Moscow in the fall of 2015 when Mr. Trump was seeking the Republican nomination.","Anderson Cooper: is there any way that special counsel Robert Mueller could investigate the Stormy Daniels payment?","Trevor Potter: Yeah that's the wildcard here.","Anderson Cooper: As a prosecutor, you wanna get leverage over somebody that you could then use to get them to give you other information on which--","Trevor Potter: Correct.","Anderson Cooper: --you're really interested in?","Trevor Potter: Correct.","That's what special counsel Mueller appears to be doing with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, who faces multiple charges including tax and bank fraud.","Anderson Cooper: Paul Manafort has been charged with crimes that don't have anything to do with Russia in some cases.","Trevor Potter: Well, and that certainly preceded the campaign. And so-- clearly, the Justice Department, the deputy attorney general who is ultimately in charge of this, has determined that looking at what Manafort did in other contexts-- is relevant to the investigation. And I think you can say exactly the same thing about Cohen. He was-- involved-- indisputably with Trump Organization activities with Russia and negotiations with the Russians. Mr. Cohen is in the middle of a place that's of great interest to the Special Counsel.","Anderson Cooper: Is there any recent precedent for p-- prosecuting somebody for an undisclosed campaign contribution?","Trevor Potter: As it happens, there is. There's sort of a pretty spectacular one.","Former Senator John Edwards was prosecuted, but never convicted, for payments a supporter and his campaign finance chairman made a year before the 2008 election to a woman who'd had Edwards' child.","Trevor Potter: I think the Edwards case is not as strong as the facts we have so far in the Trump case.","Anderson Cooper: Why do you think the potential case against Cohen or Trump is a stronger case than the Edwards case?","Trevor Potter: The timing of it. It wasn't the year before the election. It's right in the middle of the run-up to Election Day. When-- Trump's conduct with women was a prime campaign issue. In fact, it was what everyone was focused on.","White House press secretary Sarah Sanders did not respond to our request for comment from the president. But we did receive a letter from Mr. Trump's attorney Charles Harder, who asked that we show on camera and read on air one of the statements Stormy Daniels signed in January, denying reports she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump. It says, in part:","\"My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public appearances and nothing more.\"","Anderson Cooper: If Stormy Daniels denied the affair in 2011, which you say is a lie, denied the affair in early January 2018, denied the affair in late January of 2018, doesn't that hurt her credibility? I mean, she's lying, she's lying, she's lying.","Michael Avenatti: I think there's no question that it calls into question her credibility. I also think that there's no question that when the American people take all of the facts and evidence into consideration, that they are going to conclude that this woman is telling the truth. And Anderson, to the extent that Mr. Cohen and the president have an alternative version of the facts let them come forward and state it unequivocally.","Anderson Cooper: But come on. You would not sign statements one, two, three times about something which you knew to be a lie.","Michael Avenatti: If the President of the United States' fixer made it clear to me, either directly or indirectly, that I needed to sign it, and I was in the position of Stormy Daniels, I might sign those statements","Stormy Daniels: I felt intimidated and s-- honestly bullied. And I didn't know what to do. And so I signed it. Even though I had repeatedly expressed that I wouldn't break the agreement, but I was not comfortable lying.","Anderson Cooper: How do we know you're telling the truth?","Stormy Daniels: 'Cause I have no reason to lie. I'm opening myself up for, you know, possible danger and definitely a whole lot of s***.","Anderson Cooper: But, you know, there is a potential ups-- financial upside maybe somebody will want you to write a book. Maybe, you know, you can go on a bigger tour and make more money--","Stormy Daniels: That's--","Anderson Cooper: --dancing?","Stormy Daniels: That's a lot of ifs. I could also get shunned. I mean, I could automatically be alienating half of my fanbase right at this very moment.","Anderson Cooper: Jenna Jameson-- another well-known-- adult film actress said recently about you, \"The left looks at her as a whore and just uses her to try to discredit the president. The right looks at her like a treacherous rat. It's a lose-lose. Should've kept her trap shut.\"","Stormy Daniels: I think that she has a lotta wisdom in those words.","Anderson Cooper: The president watches 60 Minutes, if he's watching tonight, what would you say to him?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

A Long-Hidden Legal Memo Says Yes - The New York Times","text":["Can the President Be Indicted? A Long-Hidden Legal Memo Says Yes","WASHINGTON — A newfound memo from Kenneth W. Starr’s independent counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton sheds fresh light on a constitutional puzzle that is taking on mounting significance amid the Trump-Russia inquiry: Can a sitting president be indicted?","The 56-page memo, locked in the National Archives for nearly two decades and obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act, amounts to the most thorough government-commissioned analysis rejecting a generally held view that presidents are immune from prosecution while in office.","“It is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the president’s official duties,” the Starr office memo concludes. “In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.”","Mr. Starr assigned Ronald Rotunda, a prominent conservative professor of constitutional law and ethics whom Mr. Starr hired as a consultant on his legal team, to write the memo in spring 1998 after deputies advised him that they had gathered enough evidence to ask a grand jury to indict Mr. Clinton, the memo shows.","Other prosecutors working for Mr. Starr developed a draft indictment of Mr. Clinton, which The Times has also requested be made public. The National Archives has not processed that file to determine whether it is exempt from disclosure under grand-jury secrecy rules.","In 1974, the Watergate special counsel, Leon Jaworski, had also received a memo from his staff saying he could indict the president, in that instance Richard M. Nixon, while he was in office, and later made that case in a court brief. Those documents, however, explore the topic significantly less extensively than the Starr office memo.","In the end, both Mr. Jaworski and Mr. Starr let congressional impeachment proceedings play out and did not try to indict the presidents while they remained in office. Mr. Starr, who had decided he could indict Mr. Clinton, said in a recent interview that he had concluded the more prudent and appropriate course was simply referring the matter to Congress for potential impeachment.","As Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the latest inquiry, investigates the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia and whether President Trump obstructed justice, the newly unearthed Starr office memo raises the possibility that Mr. Mueller may have more options than most commentators have assumed. Here is an explanation of the debate and what the Starr office memo has to say.","Why do some argue presidents are immune?","Nothing in the Constitution or federal statutes says that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution, and no court has ruled that they have any such shield. But proponents of the theory that Mr. Trump is nevertheless immune for now from indictment cited the Constitution’s “structural principles,” in the words of a memo written in September 1973 by Robert G. Dixon Jr., then the head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.","This argument boils down to practicalities of governance: The stigma of being indicted and the burden of a trial would unduly interfere with a president’s ability to carry out his duties, preventing the executive branch “from accomplishing its constitutional functions” in a way that cannot “be justified by an overriding need,” Mr. Dixon wrote.","Kenneth W. Starr after testifying before the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment hearing for President Bill Clinton in November 1998.CreditJoe Marquette/Associated Press","What was the Starr office’s stance?","In laying out his case, Mr. Rotunda played down arguments that permitting a president to be indicted would cripple the executive branch. Instead, he placed greater emphasis on immunity issues that the Nixon — and, later, Clinton — legal teams dismissed.","Among them, he noted that the Constitution’s speech-or-debate clause explicitly grants limited immunity to lawmakers for certain actions. “If the framers of our Constitution wanted to create a special immunity for the president,” he argued, “they could have written the relevant clause.”","He also wrote that the 25th Amendment, which allows for temporary replacement of a president who has become unable to carry out the duties of the office, created a mechanism that would keep the executive branch from becoming incapacitated if the president was on trial.","And he noted that if indictments had to wait until a president’s term was up, some crimes would become untriable — such as those where the statute of limitations had run out. That could happen for crimes that do not rise to an impeachable offense, he wrote, citing the example of a president who punches an irritating heckler.","“No one would suggest that the president should be removed from office simply because of that assault,” he wrote. “Yet the president has no right to assault hecklers. If there is no recourse against the president, if he cannot be prosecuted for violating the criminal laws, he will be above the law.”","What has the Supreme Court said?","The Supreme Court has never addressed the question of whether a sitting president can be indicted and tried. But in a landmark 1997 ruling, Clinton v. Jones, it permitted a lawsuit against Mr. Clinton for unofficial actions — accusations of misconduct before he became president — to proceed while he was in office.","In his 2000 memo, Mr. Moss dismissed this ruling, emphasizing that the burdens of being a criminal defendant were greater than the burdens of being sued by a private litigant. But in the Starr office memo, Mr. Rotunda deemed the ruling far more significant for the criminal question.","“If public policy and the Constitution allow a private litigant to sue a sitting president for acts that are not part of the president’s official duties (and are outside the outer perimeter of those duties), and that is what Clinton v. Jones squarely held,” he wrote, “then one would think that an indictment is constitutional because the public interest in criminal cases is greater.”","Could Mueller go where no prosecutor has before?","Even if Mr. Mueller were to uncover sufficient evidence to indict Mr. Trump, decide that the legal arguments in the Starr office memo were correct and conclude that he wanted to ask a grand jury for an indictment while Mr. Trump is president — all big ifs — yet another uncertainty would loom: whether he must accept the Office of Legal Counsel’s analysis, even if he disagreed with it.","The Justice Department’s regulations give Mr. Mueller, as a special counsel, greater autonomy than an ordinary prosecutor, but still say he must follow its “rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies.” They also permit Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to overrule Mr. Mueller if he tries to take a step that Mr. Rosenstein deems contrary to such practices.","There is no guiding precedent about whether Office of Legal Counsel memos would fall into that category, or if a special counsel is free to reach his own legal judgments. But as Mr. Mueller’s office investigates, the ambiguity about the rules could influence calculations in the Trump camp about how much to cooperate and how much to fight, said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor turned defense lawyer.","“I would be surprised if Mueller indicted the president for the same prudential reasons that swayed Starr,” Mr. Mariotti said. “But the specter that he might do that could have an impact on things. If I were on the president’s team, I would say, ‘I don’t think it’s likely that he would, but it’s possible,’ depending on what the facts are.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Clinton-Era Memo Adds New Layer to Question of a Trump Indictment.

Spokeswomen say the data is not sold or shared with users’ friends or outside apps. They say the data is used “to improve people’s experience across Facebook” by helping to connect with others.","The company also says in a website posting that it does not collect the content of text messages or calls. A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that Facebook uses the information to rank contacts in Messenger so they are easier to find, and to suggest people to call.","Users get the option to allow data collection when they sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite, the Facebook posting said. “If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information,” the posting said.","The data collection can be turned off in a user’s settings, and all previously collected call and text history shared on the app will be deleted, Facebook said.","The feature was first introduced on Facebook Messenger in 2015 and added later on Facebook Lite.","Messages were left Sunday seeking comment about security from Google officials, who make the Android operating system.","Reports of the data collection came as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took out ads in multiple US and British Sunday newspapers to apologise for the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The ads say the social media platform doesn’t deserve to hold personal information if it can’t protect it.","According to the ads, a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago.

If you can’t quite bring yourself to close down your account—maybe there’s a support group or family connections you’d like to keep active—then here’s how to restrict the amount of data Facebook has got on you.","Keep your profile sparse","Screenshot: Gizmodo","Advertisement","Putting your place of work and education history on your profile is great for connecting with old school friends and networking with other users, but do you really want Facebook to know where you’ve been studying and working? Or which brand of cola you prefer?","Your profile reveals a ton of information about you, but it doesn’t have to. Open up your profile page on the web, then click Edit Profile. Click the pen icon to the right of anything you don’t want to be there, then Options, then Delete. Further down the page you can remove check-ins, interests, and anything you’ve ever liked—just click Liked and select Unlike instead.","Deleting data like this from your Facebook profile doesn’t necessarily mean Facebook will forget it ever existed—in fact it may well keep your data internally until you actually delete your account in full. However, clearing up your profile will stop apps you connect in the future from accessing it. You should also vow to ignore Facebook’s prompts to add more details to your profile from this point on.","Advertisement","Keep your activity to a minimum","Screenshot: Gizmodo","Just about everything you do on Facebook adds to the profile the company has on you: Liking, commenting, putting “maybe” on an event invitation, clicking on links, and so on. If you want to stop Facebook learning more about you, you need to cut down on your activity on the site as much as possible. To see activity that’s already been logged, go to your profile page and click View Activity Log (you can delete actions from here too).","Advertisement","Uninstall Facebook from your phones and tablets, if it’s installed, as these can reveal your location and your mobile habits to Facebook, and stick to using Facebook on the web when you absolutely have to log on. If you go to your notifications page and enable email alerts, you can get news on Facebook activity sent to your inbox, saving you having to visit the site to check every like and comment you get.","Get out of the groups you don’t need, unfriend the people you don’t absolutely have to be connected to, and of course don’t post anything yourself. If you go to your Timeline and Tagging settings on the web, you can stop other people from posting on your timeline and review any tags your friends add before they’re published—obviously you should block all of them if you’re trying to keep a low profile.","Keep third-party apps disconnected","Screenshot: Gizmodo","Advertisement","The now infamous Cambridge Analytica data harvesting happened through a third-party Facebook app—in this case a personality test—and we’ve warned you many times to keep these kind of connections down to a minimum. The more apps and sites you connect to your Facebook account, the more exposed you are.","Go to the Apps page in your Facebook settings on the web, and click the Remove button (the small x) next to everything you see on this page, unless you really, really can’t live without a certain app and trust it to use your data responsibly. Read through the confirmation message on screen, then click the Remove button again to confirm.","This doesn’t necessarily delete data those apps have already collected on you, but it’s a start. You should also click Edit under Apps others use and untick all the boxes you see—if you have friends who love personality tests and third-party apps, this stops those apps from looking at your data too.","Advertisement","Keep on top of your privacy settings","Screenshot: Gizmodo","Facebook likes to track you outside Facebook too, something which you can limit by opening up the Ads page of your Facebook settings on the web and turning the top option under Ad settings (“Ads based on my use of websites and apps”) to Off. You can also visit your ad preferences page and remove anything you find under the your interests heading.","Advertisement","To further limit the information Facebook can gather on you when you’re not actually on Facebook, head to the YourAdChoices page run by the Digital Advertising Alliance. Find the Facebook entry—and all the others you want to limit the activity of—and tick the Opt Out box (note that you need to do this for every browser you’re logged into Facebook on). If that’s not enough, we’ve previously covered a ton of more general ways you can limit how companies track your web browsing.","A lot of the other privacy settings you’ll find on your Facebook account limit who else can see your data, but doesn’t actually affect the data Facebook collects on you.

Here's What He Said","text":["Mark Zuckerberg Finally Speaks Out About Cambridge Analytica Crisis. Here's What He Said","After five days of silence during one of Facebook’s biggest privacy crises, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has finally spoken publicly about it by vowing to do better.","“The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago,” he said in a Facebook post on Friday. “But we also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.”","In recent days, a series of reports have detailed how Cambridge Analytica, a British data mining firm, gained access to personal data on 50 million Facebook users and relied on it as part of its work for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. A researcher who had access to the data after creating an app for taking personality quizzes in 2013 had handed Cambridge Analytica a copy of that data, in violation of Facebook’s policies.","The app itself had only 300,000 users. But it also collected information about all of its users’ friends.","News about Cambridge Analytica’s access to the information, which Facebook users had never consented to, set off a chorus of criticism about Facebook’s privacy safeguards. Some users have responded by saying they would delete their accounts, a potential business catastrophe for Facebook, while government regulators and lawmakers promised to investigate and possibly toughen privacy laws.","Until now, Facebook has tried to weather the PR storm without putting its top executives in the crossfire, generating questions about their leadership and whether the social network was really taking responsibility. Instead, Facebook’s PR team and lower ranking leaders have led the company’s defense by drawing technical distinctions between what happened and more common breaches by hackers, and by pointing out that Facebook curtailed the amount of user data it shared with app makers in 2014.","In his post on Friday, Zuckerberg tried to get out in front of the growing problem by calling the situation a “breach of trust” between the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan; Cambridge Analytica, which has since suspended its CEO; and Facebook. But he also acknowledged that it was “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it” while adding, “we need to fix that.”","Zuckerberg’s plan is to investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before Facebook changed its data sharing policies in 2014 and to conduct an audit of any app that shows suspicious activity. “We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit,” he promised, along with banning those that Facebook finds misused personally identifiable information and notifying users who were impacted.","Additionally, Zuckerberg said Facebook would further restrict the data it shares with developers. That includes cutting off developer access to data for users who have not used their apps in three months and limiting the amount of data shared with apps when users sign in to only names, profile photos, and email addresses.","Facebook users can also expect to see a new tool at the top of their News Feeds that show the apps they’ve used and “an easy way” to block those apps from accessing personal data. Facebook already gives users the ability to control some of their data sharing in their privacy settings, but many users don’t bother to adjust the settings or don’t realize they can.","Although Zuckerberg talked a lot about protecting user information, he did not mention why Facebook overlooked the potential problems inherent in giving developers such broad access to user data in the first place. Instead, he said the policy was merely intended made to make Facebook “more social.”","“We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward, Zuckerberg said.","Whether that’s enough for users and regulators is an open question.","This article was written by Verne Kopytoff from FORTUNE and was legally licensed by AdvisorStream through the NewsCred publisher network.","The information in this communication or any information within the Experior Financial domain, and or any attachments to any Experior Financial communication is strictly confidential and intended solely for the attention and use of the named recipient(s).

He focused on the potential benefits they have for businesses like Facebook, as well as the power they hand back to people.","He honed in on an issue that is becoming increasingly talked about – centralization versus decentralization. As CNBC reported, Facebook was in the spotlight for a number of negative issues mainly related to its ad-services and their capabilities.","\"There are important counter-trends to this, like encryption and cryptocurrency, that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.\"","Fast forward three months and Facebook was embroiled in one of the biggest scandals since its inception. In essence, the platform supplied personal data from over 50 mln users to political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.","In an interview with CNN last week, Zuckerberg even suggested that Facebook could benefit from regulation - an issue that is hanging heavily over cryptocurrencies and ICOs this year:","“I’m actually not sure we shouldn’t be regulated. In general, technology is an increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question should be ‘what is the right regulation rather than ‘yes or no, should it be regulated.”","“On the basic side, there are things like ads transparency regulation that I would love to see. If you look at how much regulation there is around advertising on TV and in print, it's just not clear why there should be less on the internet, you should have the same level of transparency required.”","Meanwhile one of the primary attributes of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the ability to encrypt data giving anonymity and privacy to users.","Twitter CEO beams on Bitcoin","While Zuckerberg battles with Facebook’s ongoing woes, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been waxing lyrical on Bitcoin of late.","In an interview with the Sunday Times issued on March 21, the Twitter and Square CEO forecast that Bitcoin could one day become the single global currency in ten years time.","“The world ultimately will have a single currency. The Internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin, probably over ten years, but it could go faster.”","Having personally invested in Bitcoin, Dorsey is a staunch advocate for the virtual currency. He’s also the CEO of point-of-sale software startup Square, which would soon integrate a Bitcoin buy/sell functionality.","Furthermore, Dorsey also invested in Lightning Labs, which has seeded $2.5 mln to spearhead the development of the Lightning Network which promises to provide free and fast Bitcoin transactions.","“It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of Blockchain and make it more approachable.”","What is disconcerting is that Twitter is the latest social media platform to ban cryptocurrency advertising.","Murmurs of an impending ban last week were confirmed on March 27. Twitter will begin cutting out advertising of initial coin offerings and their token sales as well as global cryptocurrency wallet platforms if they are not publicly listed on select stock exchanges.","Once again, there is a clear disconnect between the thoughts and views of its leadership and the plans of the business itself.","Twitter has followed in the footsteps of Facebook. The social media platforms are trying to protect users from fraudulent companies and scams, which have taken advantage of many through advertising campaigns on social media networks.","However, that has painted everyone with the same brush. In essence, innovative startups with ingenious business plans have been stifled due to the actions of fraudsters and scam artists looking to ride the Blockchain and cryptocurrency wave.","Furthermore, Twitter, in particular, has been rife with accounts impersonating well-known cryptocurrency advocators and accounts, which has caught unsuspecting users out.","Google to follow suit","The world’s biggest search engine, Google, is following in the footsteps of its social media cousins.","As reported in March, Google’s updated financial services policy will rule out all related cryptocurrency advertising through its AdWords service from June 2018. Once again, consumer protection is touted as the main driving factor behind the move.","Companies like Blockchain based cloud storage Storj and payment platform Veem, which Google has backed financially, will in essence be unable to advertise on the search engine once the ban comes into effect.","The move to ban crypto advertising comes less than a year after Google’s parent company Alphabet invested in London-based online wallet Blockchain.info. It also remains to be seen how this service will be able to advertise on the search engine come June 2018.","At the time, Alphabet partner Tom Hulme said their investment in the company, which raised over $70 mln in overall funding, was essential because “the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched,” as quoted by Fortune.","And yet cryptocurrency wallet providers and promising ICOs will no longer have access to the world’s biggest search engine in two months time.","As reported by Recode, the likes of Alibaba and Tencent haven’t allowed this cryptocurrency related advertising for far longer. Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post revealed that it seems search engine Baidu is not returning adverts for any cryptocurrency related searches - only news articles and posts.","Russian search engine Yandex is also expected to follow suit - according to local media reports.","Where to from here?","This is a question that may not be answered for months. The whole world seems to be waiting for clear regulatory guidelines on cryptocurrencies and ICOs.","While the likes of the SEC pioneer this space, we may see continued apathy towards the promotion of ICOs and cryptocurrency tokens sales on most online platforms for some time.","Until there are firm guidelines in place that protect the majority of users from ICO scams and misleading investment opportunities, these extreme sanctions are likely to remain in effect."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)","As I wrote earlier today, the story of Cambridge Analytica that the press, public and elected officials seem to have fixated on is that of a rogue company run amok with breached data that manipulated unwitting Americans into electing the candidate of the company’s choice (the company denies all of the allegations). A key thread of the narrative over the last three days has centered on the alleged impact of the company’s data analysis on the 2016 presidential election with the undertone that if true, the company’s actions somehow represent something new and unsettling in using data to advance a political campaign. To add a bit of perspective to this debate, it is worth looking back at two key ways in which the Obama campaign pioneered the modern data-driven campaign that is at the center of the Cambridge Analytica debate.","At the time of his election and reelection, Obama’s data analytics researchers were heralded as technology heroes for the way they modernized how political campaigns wrangle data in the pursuit of votes. Outlets sang their praises as “digital masterminds” and lauded their “unorthodox” approaches.","One highly publicized innovation was the construction of precision television viewership models that allowed the Obama campaign to precisely model private viewership habits of Americans: “The team bought detailed data on TV viewing by millions of cable subscribers, showing which channels they were watching, sometimes on a second-by-second basis. The information — which is collected from set-top cable boxes and sold by a company called Rentrak — doesn’t show who was watching, but the campaign used a third-party company to match viewing data to its own internal list of voters and poll responses.”","In short, the campaign was able to heavily optimize its advertising efforts by quite literally reaching into the privacy of Americans’ living rooms and understanding what they were watching second by second. While the data didn’t offer an address-level resolution, as the Post description above notes, it was sufficient for the campaign to generate exquisitely high-resolution advertising models that achieved up to 20% greater efficiency.","Yet, perhaps of greatest relevance to the controversy surrounding Cambridge Analytica is how the Obama campaign leveraged Facebook. As Carol Davidsen, former Director of Integration of Media Analytics for Obama for America put it last night in a series of tweets reflecting back on the 2012 campaign: “Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing. They came to office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.” Yet, she caveated the campaign’s use of the data noting that the project “felt creepy” but that they “played by the rules.”","A New York Times Magazine profile of the time offers a bit more detail how the Obama campaign’s platform worked and it is strikingly similar to the system Facebook claims was used by Cambridge Analytica. As the Times describes it, the campaign “started with a list that grew to a million people who had signed into the campaign Web site through Facebook. When people opted to do so, they were met with a prompt asking to grant the campaign permission to scan their Facebook friends lists, their photos and other personal information. In another prompt, the campaign asked for access to the users’ Facebook news feeds” which 75% permitted and “once permission was granted, the campaign had access to millions of names and faces they could match against their lists of persuadable voters, potential donors, unregistered voters and so on.”","According to one staffer who was involved with the project, next “it would take us 5 to 10 seconds to get a friends list and match it against the voter list … [next] we would grab the top 50 you were most active with and then crawl their wall … we asked to see photos but really we were looking for who were tagged in photos with you, which was a really great way to dredge up old college friends — and ex-girlfriends.”","As the Times put it, the massive exporting of private user data triggered repeated alarms at Facebook due to the volume of profile data going out the door, but that “in each case, the company was satisfied the campaign was not violating its privacy and data standards.” In all, through its data efforts, the campaign ended up with a database of 15 million persuadable voters.","In short, according to the Times’ reporting, which is borne out by many other reports of the time, the Obama campaign engaged in nearly identical activity to what Cambridge Analytica is claimed to have done: they took a set of users who willingly contributed their data to a cause and quietly mined their friend lists, downloading immense volumes of private material from unwitting individuals that never authorized, let alone had any idea, that a political campaign was harvesting their information from Facebook simply because a person they were connected with had given the organization permission to harvest their information.","In Obama’s case, the original contributors at least explicitly knew they were contributing to a campaign effort, even if their millions of unwitting friends had no idea their private information was being harvested to attempt to sway their voting behavior. In Cambridge Analytica’s case, users knew only that they were contributing to an academic research project, but the line between academia and the corporate world is ever more blurred in the data world and it is routine for academic institutions to engage in corporate-supported research using data owned by the institution in the support of commercial agendas. Indeed, the claims that Facebook data was collected for academic research and then made available to a commercial enterprise is hardly surprising for anyone familiar with the processes and procedures at most top US research universities, especially their corporate-funded research and their licensing and commercialization programs.","Putting this all together, both Cambridge Analytica and the Obama campaign are claimed to have harvested information about millions of users from Facebook by starting with an initial seed list of users who granted permission to harvest their friends lists, which were then used to mass export available information on many millions of unwitting users who had never authorized their data to be accessed nor were they even aware of its export. The Obama campaign even appears to have mined wall photographs to identify who each user was tagged with to understand who were close friends and who were merely casual acquaintances, looking for “old college friends and ex-girlfriends.” The only difference appears to be that in the case Cambridge Analytica case, Facebook claims that the data was gathered for academic research and then made available for campaigning, while in the Obama case the campaign was in charge of data collection from the start. Given the academic tradition, at least in the US, of corporate-funded research, it is likely Cambridge Analytica could easily have simply funded the necessary research directed at a university to ensure all usage was still considered to be academic in nature and avoided the whole controversy, to begin with. After all, in the case of the myPersonality project all users are required to register as “collaborators” and at least one Facebook data scientist is listed, suggesting the company has not historically been adverse to the sharing of bulk extracted datasets for research (though myPersonality appears to exclusively contain user submitted data, rather than bulk friend harvesting).","Facebook did not respond to requests for comment on why it saw the Obama campaign’s use of its data as acceptable while it believes Cambridge Analytica’s use was not and specifically what distinctions it sees between the two use cases nor did it respond to a request for comment on whether it would be requesting that other researchers and organizations with large holdings of Facebook data restrict access to them or delete them entirely. In the end, will this mark business as usual, with a burst of negative press and when the dust settles no change or will this somehow change the social media landscape? At the very least, it will be interesting to see whether we still hold up our social media data miners as “digital masterminds” and heroes modernizing campaigning, or whether like the three letter agencies that similarly mine social media, whether they will go underground and in future work quietly to ply their trade in the shadows.","Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years working to reimagine how we use data to understand the world around us at scales and in ways never before..."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

According to Mark Zuckerberg, “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it. You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014. This was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. We’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again, We’ve already stopped apps like this from getting so much information. Now we’re limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook. We’re also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected. Finally, we’ll remind you which apps you’ve given access to your information – so you can shut off the ones you don’t want anymore. Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.”","What Facebook Data Did Cambridge Analytica Get?\nThe answer to this question will emerge in the upcoming investigations and licit proceedings. But we can make a pretty good conjecture at what data Cambridge Analytica obtained by looking at the endpoints of Facebook’s Graph API v1.0 (Application Programming Interface) which launched April 21, 2010, and wasn’t fully closed down until April 30, 2015. Using Facebook’s Graph API v1.0, developers had unconstrained access to almost all of your public-facing profile data, including:\nid, name, first name, last name, link, gender, locale, timezone, updated time, verified.","The heart of the scandal fixates on one of the API’s permissions groups called “Extended Profile Properties.” These endpoints provided access to data about your friends that your friends may not have explicitly granted permission for Facebook to expose, specifically:\nabout me, actions, activities, birthday checkins, history, events, games activity, groups, hometown, interests, likes, location, notes, online presence, photo video tags, photos, questions, relationship details, relationships, religion, politics, status, subscriptions, website, work history.\nIn another permissions group, the API exposed an endpoint called read_mailbox which, just as it sounds, allowed developers access to users’ private messages.","What Can You Do with that Lot of Data?\nWith tens of millions of opulent data profiles, you can apply the implements of data scientific research to turn the data into action. This conventionally follows a disciplined methodology that commences with transforming the data into utilizable cohorts and clusters, learning about the propensities of the different cohorts and clusters, and then prognosticating how they might react to messaging by utilizing simulations. Optimization is another common use for data. None of this is incipient. None of this is news. This is how internet advertising works.","If Cambridge Analytica didn’t obtain this data set from Facebook, it could have simply purchased a bunch of data and used best practices mar-tech tools to accomplish its marketing goals. Not surprisingly, a fair number of digital marketers believe that Cambridge Analytica would have achieved better results by leveraging the platforms directly.","Why Do I Care about This?\nThe silver lining to the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal is the fact that you are becoming vigilant of what data you engender, what is accumulated, and how it is utilized. This is a very good thing.","When Facebook urges you to configure your privacy settings, they are utilizing the erroneous words. The company should be advising you that you are actually configuring your “Public Persona Settings” or your “Online Presence Settings” or simply your “Public Settings.” Whom you share your stuff with and who gets to see it are practically meaningless in the context of this issue. What you should be configuring is your “Personal Data Sharing Permission Settings” or “API Endpoint Permissions.” These settings would restrict the data that could be extracted while we are passively going about our business online.","No. It authentically isn’t. As a society, we have to raise our caliber of data maturity. Pellucidly Facebook has grown more expeditious than it has matured. Societally, we are all neophytes when it comes to data literacy and data governance.","If you optate control of your data, it would be a great conception to understand what that signifies. “They ken everything about me,” verbalizes someone scared out of their wits by sensationalist headlines. No. They don’t. They have data that can be turned into action to enrich organizations perspicacious enough to utilize it. Are you hurt by this? Could you be?","Right now, you get to utilize Facebook, Google, Gmail, Twitter and other “free” apps for the cost of your data. Your data is currency for them. If you don’t want to pay with your data, you are welcome to make other culls. But you should understand how your data is being used afore making a blanket verbalization that your data should be 100 percent private and 100 percent forfended. Data is a form of currency, and it is a valid way to pay for goods and accommodations. Data can be (and is) transformed into cash by tech companies. But that does not diminish the value of the accommodations they provide.","Just because you did not take the time to learn how you were paying for a tech accommodation and you mentally conceived it was “free” doesn’t designate it is authentically free and, most importantly, that you would be disposed to pay cash mazuma for it.","So let’s utilize this scandal as an opportunity to learn as much as we can about data so when we commence the regulatory process, we do it in a responsible way."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S.

Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie.

All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform.

Well I think we there's been warmer from the White House are McDonald caught with a worth sworn in at present the United States. This is just another part of it towards what we are what's happening here now what everybody can view on the air.
