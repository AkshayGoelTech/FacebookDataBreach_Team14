Edwards said the company claimed it wasn't bound by New Zealand's privacy laws and didn't have to comply with a request from his office to take a look at the disputed information.","Facebook said Edwards had made a \"broad and intrusive\" request for private data, and that the company was protecting its users.","\"We are disappointed that the New Zealand privacy commissioner asked us to provide access to a year's worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticized us for protecting their privacy,\" the company said in a statement.","The commissioner's finding allows the man to seek financial damages against Facebook.

Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any political campaigns in its statement, attributed to company Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal.","\"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,\" Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","Cambridge Analytica worked for the failed presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and then for the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. On its website, it says it \"provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House\".","Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday.","Advertisement","In past interviews with Reuters, Parscale has said that Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 Trump campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook's Grewal said the company was taking the unusual step of announcing the suspension \"given the public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica and its parent organization.","The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world's largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebookvice president, said in a Twitter post.","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses \"behavioral microtargeting\", or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and it is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica and two individuals going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data that he acquired with a so-called \"research app\" that used Facebook's login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The app was downloaded by about 270,000 people.

(Thibault Camus / Associated Press)","If you can't trust a social network to protect your data, what can you do?","Some use Facebook for their jobs. For many who run an online business, Facebook is essential. For others, it remains the best way to remember birthdays, schedule events, post photos and stay in touch with friends and family across the globe — privacy concerns aside.","So what can you do if you want to protect yourself without deleting your Facebook account? There's no perfect solution, but there are a few steps you can take to keep your account more secure.","What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn't a data breach in the traditional sense: Facebook was not hacked and its systems were not infiltrated. Instead, Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining firm with ties to the Trump campaign, is accused of purchasing personal information on millions of Facebook users from University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan.","Kogan had permission to collect data from the 270,000 people who filled out his personality survey through an app he created called \"thisisyourdigitallife.\" The survey also collected data on respondents' entire networks of Facebook friends, totaling around 50 million people.","Until Facebook changed its third-party data-sharing rules in 2015, such information-gathering was allowed by the site's Terms of Service. What wasn't allowed was selling the data collected to a commercial entity such as Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used the information to target political messages. Since the scandal erupted, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica have been banned from Facebook.","\"People feel that they were being spied on, and that their data and their privacy is being breached without their consent,\" said Karen North, a professor of digital social media for USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.","Though deleting your Facebook account makes a statement, it's not a permanent solution to protecting your data online, said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that advocates for free expression and privacy online.","In her opinion, people shouldn't have to delete Facebook. Facebook should do better.","\"If you want to use a platform or a service that adds value to your life, you shouldn't have to sell your soul and kiss your privacy goodbye,\" Gebhart said.","Any time you interact with Facebook — whether you're checking into a location, posting vacation photos, or \"liking\" a friend's status — you are giving Facebook data. Any time you interact with a third-party developer — games such as FarmVille and apps that show you what your profile photo would look like if you were older or a different gender, or tell you what the most popular song was the year you graduated from high school — you are giving your data to Facebook and to that developer. (Sometimes in ways you might not realize: sharing a post about the most popular song during the year you graduated high school tells Facebook what year you graduated from high school, even if that information isn't on your profile.)","If you're done turning your data over to Facebook, it offers two options: Deactivating your account, and deleting your account. Deactivating essentially puts your profile on pause. If you decide later on that you want to use Facebook again, you can reactivate it and all your posts will still be there.","Deleting it is a more permanent solution. After a 90-day waiting period during which Facebook lets you change your mind, your profile ceases to exist. Facebook says it doesn't retain anything you've posted or any information that could identify you. (It does retain de-identified data to track usage.)","Of course, even if Facebook itself deletes your data, that still leaves the third-party apps. Once you disable an app from your profile, Facebook stops sharing your data with it. However, you need to reach out to the app directly to ask its developer to delete the data you have already handed over.","One problem with that: \"Basically, there's no enforcement mechanism\" to make sure the developer actually deletes your data when you ask them to, said Serge Egelman, the research director of the Usable Security and Privacy Group at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley. \"Facebook just takes it on faith that everyone complies with this and doesn't use data inappropriately, which is obviously ridiculous.\"","Advertisement","Facebook says it's trying to change that. In Mark Zuckerberg's statement Wednesday on the Cambridge Analytica debacle, he outlined the steps the company would take to boost enforcement, including an investigation into apps that had access to large amounts of data prior to the company's data-sharing rule changes and a full audit of apps with \"suspicious activity.\"","Gebhart of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said the changes were a good start, but don't go far enough. Furthermore, Facebook is asking people to trust it to fix a problem it was responsible for in the first place — something she feels Facebook really hasn't owned up to.","Overall, she said, the onus should be on Facebook and other tech companies to fix these problems and protect users, and to have full accountability and transparency in doing so.","\"You shouldn't have to be a settings wizard and technology expert to enjoy these platforms with security,\" she said.","In the meantime, here's what she and other experts recommend to make your data as safe as possible.","Unfriend people you don't know or barely speak to","It's fun to have a high friend count, but as the Cambridge Analytica incident proved, your data could be vulnerable through your network. Weed out anyone you don't really know or haven't spoken to in years.","Be aware of what's publicly available from your profile","Facebook has an option to see what your profile looks like to the public. Go to Settings > Timeline and Tagging > Review > Review what other people see on your timeline, and click View As.","Lock down any information you don't want to be public.","For instance, you might not want anyone and everyone to know your hometown, your marital status, or where you work.","Review which apps have access to your data","If you've been using Facebook for a long time, you've probably enabled a staggering number of apps that you've completely forgotten about. Go to Settings > Apps > Logged in with Facebook and remove anything that doesn't absolutely need access to your Facebook profile.","Deleting those apps means Facebook will no longer provide them with your data, though you have to reach out to the app developer directly to get them to delete the data they already have. Facebook provides you with a link to contact the developer to begin the process.","Disable API sharing","Many websites and apps allow you to sign in with your Facebook account. This means one less password to remember. But it also means Facebook is connected to whatever you're doing in that app or on that site. If you really want to disconnect, disable API sharing by going to Settings > Apps > Apps, Website and Plugins, and click Edit. Disable it.","Advertisement","It's worth noting that this is something of a nuclear option: Some dating and ride-sharing apps and other sites require you to use a Facebook login as a way of proving you're really who you say you are. If you disable API sharing entirely, you won't be able to use them, so you might want to review and revoke permissions on a case-by-case basis.","Lie – or at least limit what you share about yourself","If you're committed to throwing Facebook and advertisers off your trail, make it harder for them to pin down exactly who you are. Mark Marino, director of the Humanities and Critical Code Studies Lab at USC, says he tells people to create a little noise in their profile. Basically, lie. Make your birthday a different date than it actually is. Tell Facebook you're 100 years old. There's no reason Facebook needs to know your hometown, or which of your friends are actually your family members. A lot of people fill in those fields just because they're there, but they are not mandatory to having a Facebook account.","Gebhart said there's no way to make sure your online data is completely safe and protected, but steps like these should give you peace of mind. She likened it to locking your door at night: You know someone could hypothetically pick the lock or break the door down, but you can feel reasonably safe with the door locked."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

Former US officials David Vladeck and Jessica Rich have told the Washington Post that Facebook's data sharing may violate the FTC consent decree requiring that it both ask for permission before sharing data and report any authorized access. The \"Thisisyourdigitallife\" app at the heart of the affair asked for permission from those who directly used it, but not the millions of Facebook friends whose data was taken in the process.","Facebook, for its part, said that it \"reject[s] any suggestion\" that it violated the consent decree. It maintained that it \"respected\" users' privacy settings.","If the FTC did find violations, Facebook could be on the hook for some very hefty fines -- albeit fines that aren't likely to be as hefty as possible. The decree asks for fines as large as $40,000 per person, but that would amount to roughly $2 trillion. Regulators like the FTC historically push for fines they know companies can pay, which would suggest fines that are 'just' in the billion-dollar range. Given that there are already multiple American and European investigations underway, any financial penalty would be just one piece of a larger puzzle.","The possibility of FTC action comes right as there are complaints about Facebook's response to Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who blew open the data sharing scandal. His attorney, Tamsin Allen, has stated that Facebook took a two-faced approach to Wylie's revelations. It \"privately welcomed\" Wylie's help, Allen said, but publicly suspended his account and criticized him. That was indicative of a company focused more on \"damage limitation\" than sincerely addressing the problem at hand, according to the attorney. We've asked Facebook for its response, but the accusations certainly don't help its case.","Cambridge Analytica has tried to distance itself from the incident, claiming that Wylie was a contractor rather than a founder and that it was a partner, Global Science Research, that had harvested users' data. The company said it purged the data when it had learned that GSR sold data to outside parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

They “built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons” their whistleblower Christopher Wylie is quoted as saying. It was a powerful tool for a campaign based on fear and paranoia. Little surprise then that Cambridge Analaytica is also being investigated by the Office of the Information Commissioner and by the Electoral Commission in the UK in connection with their work on the Brexit referendum.","But the main Observer story oddly misses the point. It focuses on how long it took Facebook to own up to the ‘breach’ and suspend Cambridge Analytica’s access to the service. It describes the accessing of the data itself as “one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches”.","But it wasn’t. And that’s not the importance of this story.","Anyone can harvest data from the web. I harvest it when I can’t remember someone’s birthday or their kids’ names. The Lib Dems harvest it indirectly when they use targeted Facebook advertising. My engagement team in a previous job harvested it using smart algorithms to find possible engagement targets, ironically, to promote better data, openness and transparency. The point is that all this information is out there and – a point confusingly referred to in the Observer piece – platforms like Facebook don’t regard it as their data but their users’ (“it may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided”). Facebook’s suspension of CA appears to be because of technical breaches to their terms of use, particularly the sale of data to third parties.","The real risk in all this is in the use to which this kind of big data can now be put. Mass harvesting followed by sophisticated modelling can now put very particular and individual information to use in support of data user’s objectives. It’s not new in principle. When I was in charity fundraising, models told me that people who ticked ‘enjoy going to the pub’ in consumer surveys were more likely to donate so I bought that list from the survey company. But the scale and sophistication of modern big data analysis, modelling and individualised targeting makes it a much bigger issue.","Facebook themselves do it. Their advertisers do it. Financial institutions are actively considering doing it to make life-changing decisions about people’s personal finances and may already be doing so. Terrorists could do it if they could muster the analysis. Foreign intelligence agencies can do it. Political campaigns of any stripe can do it – and did so in our last two General Elections, completely undermining the hilarious idea that local constituencies observe a spending limit in the region of £10,000 each. ‘National’ campaigns use Facebook (and indeed many other media) to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in individual seats, a massive loophole in election law that will always disproportionately benefit the richest party.","And of course governments can do it. China is using its control of domestic social media and state data sources to develop a system of social surveillance and control that makes 1984 look like a description of nursery school.","Policymakers haven’t kept up. The European Union has long championed the rights of data users to fair processing of their data – inconvenient for the direct marketing industry but good for civil liberties (and yet another reason we’re right about Brexit). Liberal Democrats have traditionally championed a Digital Bill of Rights within the UK. A good instinct although I have vainly pointed out at repeated conferences that it’s daft to try to ban our own intelligence services from collecting any mass data at all when everyone else is doing it – including the party itself.","As with many other imminent threats to our wellbeing, from financial instability to climate change, it is fanciful to imagine that nation states can tackle this issue alone. We need stronger global action and Britain’s diplomatic muscle, technical expertise and libertarian instincts should make it a natural leader. This is obviously at odds with the current zeitgeist of selfish isolationalism. But it’s why the Lib Dem international policy working group I’ve been chairing is proposing we put both both human rights and technology at the forefront of future foreign policy.","* Martin Horwood was LibDem MP for Cheltenham 2005-15 and international affairs spokesperson for the parliamentary party. He is currently chairing the party’s national policy working group on Britain’s Place in the World but is writing in a personal capacity.","12 Comments","Absolutely right, Martin. I’m alarmed that so few people are onto this. I covered it in my report ‘Elections for Sale?’ for the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust on whether election spending limits are fit for purpose (http://jrrt.org.uk/publications/elections-sale-full-version, pages 25-36) and had hoped the issue would have gained more traction by now. We must definitely care about this, and our parliamentary party must push to ensure the Facebook data issue stays in the news.","It just shows how out of touch I must be with mankind. Here’s another article on LDV, which makes a strong point but fails to excite contributors! So, I’ll have another go.","I believe that, when mobile phones started to become popular, makers decided to offer texting as an add on. Now it would appear that this facility has largely supplanted the human voice and, with technological advances, has enabled sites such as Facebook and Twitter seemingly to monopolise lives. How often do my wife and I go out for a meal to see young couples nearby avidly texting rather than actually talking to each other, not to mention young parents and their offspring each other as they clutch their iPhones? What kind of interaction is that?","No wonder dubious organisations have latched on to this captive audience to exert an influence which has its echos in Orwell’s 1984. I know how addictive iPhones and iPads can be – I’m forever reaching for my tablet when I’m at home! The worrying thing for someone who refuses to do Facebook, Twitter or any of the other seductive sites around, is how easily these sites can apparently be used to influence opinion without many of their users realising that the view of the world they represent can be dangerously biased and – dare I say it.- illiberal.","Maybe, Jennie; but what an odd way to conduct your affairs. When my son or daughter in law start doing it when my wife and I are around and trying to have a conversation with them I have to say that we find that rather insulting. Perhaps it’s a generation thing. Mind you, judging from you photo, you’re a bit younger than me, so I guess it won’t matter that much as people like me won’t be around much longer so texting can inherit the earth! On the other hand, if they don’t want to be heard, they could talk quietly (which some people find difficult to do these days), couldn’t they, rather than wear out their thumbs?","My boss was doing it during a personnel interview. I wanted to complain but perhaps what she was doing was checking on when she needed to collect Kids from school, but maybe it would have been better to have the interview at a different time of day.","I agree but believe there is a more fundamental question we need to answer too. Over 20 years selling consumer targeting technology to large corporations and marketing agencies I have witnessed a massive increase in capability. This huge leap, in common with other amazing scientific advancements like stem cell research, presents society with new unresolved ethical questions lagging behind the science. The use of wide ranging digitally collected massive quantities of personal data combined with highly sophisticated analytics in real-time, is a hugely different force from selecting broad groups of customers based on demographic characteristics from a database updated once a month. Its hard to find a good analogy, but lets go for the difference between a canon and a guided missile. I have often heard it said by practitioners that they can predict your response, better than you can predict it yourself. Given this, and in light of the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook allegations would it not be reasonable to consider the ethics of this new marketing capability in the way we considered the ethics of subliminal marketing in the past? Using such techniques requires special consideration for use in political campaigns, but also asks ethical questions about extent of use in commerce too.","John Marriott 19th Mar ’18 – 7:52pm I did keep my opinions to myself, but I do remember a Prime Minister (John Major) saying things that were not followed by departmental ministers at the time, leaving us to reply to letters from MPs and advise Treasury Solicitors on Judicial Reviews.","The Observer on Sunday 8/4/2018 has mooted a new centre party. We should remember that Roy Jenkins’ objectives were either to be in government (hence gold as our party colour) or to cause such change in the Labour Party as to have the same effect. Radio Kent had a ‘phone in this morning (in the slot sometimes occupied by former MP Lembit Opik).https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/07/opportunity-knocks-for-new-party-will-anybody-dare-open-door\nMy view was that the SDP was founded by four high calibre people and that the Labour MPs currently at odds with their party line are less prominent and less famous. As they said they were heavily dependent on bye-elections and were occupying a political space occupied by the Liberal Party, necessitating some deals over which opportunity would be taken by which party. UKIP prospered on proportional representation for the European Parliament, but has since declined as one Independent, ex-UKIP, councillor conceded. I mentioned Canada, but there was no traction. I think the BBC journalists were more interested in the future, but they were also stuck in a rut about Red-Blue politics which should shame them.","Post a Comment","Lib Dem Voice welcomes comments from everyone but we ask you to be polite, to be on topic\nand to be who you say you are.

But, as users discovered when prompted to download a copy of their personal data before permanently deleting their Facebook accounts, a certain amount of data was covertly siphoned without explicit permissions. Buried inside those data caches was an unsettling amount of specific, detailed information—in some cases, every phone call or text message ever sent or received on their Android device. Dylan McKay, who apparently owns an Android phone, reported that for the period between November 2016 and July 2017, his archives contained “the metadata of every cellular call I’ve ever made, including time and duration” and “metadata about every text message I’ve ever received or sent.” When people like McKay agreed to share their contacts with Facebook, it appears they didn’t know the extent to which they were giving Facebook access to their personal information.","Facebook responded with a blog post laying out the applicable user-agreement terms and denying that Facebook collects call or SMS data surreptitiously. “Contact uploading is optional. People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone—it’s explained right there in the apps when you get started,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian. “People can delete previously uploaded information at any time and can find all the information available to them in their account and activity log from our Download Your Information tool.”","View more","But the revelation couldn’t have come at a worse time for Facebook, which is trying—and failing—to dig itself out from under the Cambridge Analytica fiasco.

In the ad, Zuckerberg called the Cambridge Analytica leak a “breach of trust” and apologized, reassuring readers that “we’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” but so far it seems to have missed the mark.

His regret led him to tell his story to\nThe New York Times\nand\nThe Observer, whose reports have caused a huge stir.","In 2013, he had a big idea. New research was showing that a person’s social media activity could be used to build a detailed profile of their personality. Wylie believed that it could predict their political views too. Armed with such data, a political candidate could, say, target adverts at potential voters.","Wylie soon found financial backers:\nRepublicans\nin the USA. He helped set up a company in the UK,\nCambridge Analytica\n(CA), to execute his vision. The company hired\nAleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge academic, to create a Facebook app that asked users to give access to their profile. It also invited them to share data about their friends (without the friends’ consent).","Altogether, the app gathered data on around\n50 million\nAmericans. It claimed to need the data for academic purposes. In fact, Kogan sold the information to CA, which went on to help Donald Trump’s campaign. The sale violated Facebook’s privacy rules. The social media giant learned of this in 2015; according to Wylie, it\ndid not try\nvery hard to set things right.","As Wylie puts it, “We ‘broke’ Facebook.”","CA’s and Facebook’s influence on politics is being investigated in both the UK and the US. Wylie’s revelations, backed by hard evidence, contradict\nstatements\nmade by the firms to the inquiries. Both deny any wrongdoing. However, Facebook has suspended CA (and Wylie) from its platform, and says that it is looking into the issue.","This apparent breach of data comes at an\nawkward time\nfor Facebook. The firm was already on the defensive, as critics accused it of spreading fake news and Russian propaganda. Should we just stop using the website?","Sell-by data","Rubbish, say some. Overall, Facebook is a force for good. Whether you want to raise awareness of an issue that’s close to your heart or just message a friend, the website is on your side. Let’s take this crisis as an opportunity to read its privacy rules, and make sure we’re using it responsibly.","How naive, reply others. Facebook’s privacy policy is designed to confuse you. But Wylie’s story shows that, even if it has the best intentions, the website is sloppy about protecting your data. A significant amount of your personal information is ending up in unauthorised people’s hands. The only way to avoid this for sure is to log off for good.","You decide","Would the world be a poorer place without Facebook?","Will social media still exist in 50 years?","Activities","Make a list of the information that is publicly displayed on your social media. Pair up, and write a “personality profile” of your partner based on their info.","Spend a week without going on social media. Keep a journal of your thoughts about the experience. Will you go back to social media in a week? Why (not)?","Some people say...","“Move fast and break things.”","Facebook’s former motto","What do you think?","Q & A","What do we know?","Kogan’s app paid Facebook users to take a personality test. In return, it got access to “almost everything” on their profiles, says Wylie. This was permitted — but selling the data was not (which is why Facebook is blaming Kogan). On learning of Kogan’s deal with CA in 2015, Facebook shut down his app, and asked everyone involved to delete the data. But it has been revealed that this did not happen.","What do we not know?","Exactly how this data was used, and what effect it had. Former officials on the Trump campaign say that CA helped them design target audiences for digital ads, model voter turnout, and more. However, some say that CA has exaggerated its own influence; others argue that it may not have relied much on the “stolen” data anyway.","Word watch","Republicans","CA received its funding from Robert Mercer, an American billionaire who initially backed Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign before switching to Trump. The company was co-founded by Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser.","Cambridge Analytica","The firm also worked with the pro-Brexit campaign in the UK. It is independent of Cambridge University.","Aleksandr Kogan","The Russia-born neuroscientist has received research grants from the Russian government.","50 million","This was equal to almost one quarter of registered American voters at the time.","Did not try","Wylie says that Facebook was slow to ask him to delete the data, and when it eventually did, it failed to double-check that he had complied.","Statements","The parliamentary committee that interrogated Facebook and CA executives now wants them to come back and explain themselves.

What I saw from the inside was a company that prioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse. As the world contemplates what to do about Facebook in the wake of its role in Russia’s election meddling, it must consider this history. Lawmakers shouldn’t allow Facebook to regulate itself. Because it won’t.","Facebook knows what you look like, your location, who your friends are, your interests, if you’re in a relationship or not, and what other pages you look at on the web. This data allows advertisers to target the more than one billion Facebook visitors a day. It’s no wonder the company has ballooned in size to a $500 billion behemoth in the five years since its I.P.O.","The more data it has on offer, the more value it creates for advertisers. That means it has no incentive to police the collection or use of that data — except when negative press or regulators are involved. Facebook is free to do almost whatever it wants with your personal information, and has no reason to put safeguards in place.","For a few years, Facebook’s developer platform hosted a thriving ecosystem of popular social games. Remember the age of Farmville and Candy Crush? The premise was simple: Users agreed to give game developers access to their data in exchange for free use of addictive games.","Unfortunately for the users of these games, there were no protections around the data they were passed through Facebook to outside developers. Once data went to the developer of a game, there was not much Facebook could do about misuse except to call the developer in question and threaten to cut off the developer’s access. As the I.P.O. approached, and the media reported on allegations of misuse of data, I, as manager of the team responsible for protecting users on the developer platform from abuse of their data, was given the task of solving the problem.","In one instance, a developer appeared to be using Facebook data to automatically generate profiles of children, without their consent. When I called the company responsible for the app, it claimed that Facebook’s policies on data use were not being violated, but we had no way to confirm whether that was true. Once data passed from the platform to a developer, Facebook had no view of the data or control over it. In other cases, developers asked for permission to get user data that their apps obviously didn’t need — such as a social game asking for all of your photos and messages. People rarely read permissions request forms carefully, so they often authorize access to sensitive information without realizing it.","At a company that was deeply concerned about protecting its users, this situation would have been met with a robust effort to cut off developers who were making questionable use of data. But when I was at Facebook, the typical reaction I recall looked like this: try to put any negative press coverage to bed as quickly as possible, with no sincere efforts to put safeguards in place or to identify and stop abusive developers. When I proposed a deeper audit of developers’ use of Facebook’s data, one executive asked me, “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?”","The message was clear: The company just wanted negative stories to stop. It didn’t really care how the data was used.","When Russians decided to target Americans during the 2016 election, they didn’t buy TV or newspaper ads, or hire a skywriter. They turned to Facebook, where their content reached at least 126 million Americans. The fact that Facebook prioritized data collection over user protection and regulatory compliance is precisely what made it so attractive. Now the company is arguing that it should be allowed to regulate itself to prevent this from happening again. My experience shows that it should not.","Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, mentioned in an October interview with Axios that one of the ways the company uncovered Russian propaganda ads was by identifying that they had been purchased in rubles. Given how easy this was, it seems clear the discovery could have come much sooner than it did — a year after the election. But apparently Facebook took the same approach to this investigation as the one I observed during my tenure: react only when the press or regulators make something an issue, and avoid any changes that would hurt the business of collecting and selling data.","This makes for a dangerous mix: a company that reaches most of the country every day and has the most detailed set of personal data ever assembled, but has no incentive to prevent abuse. Facebook needs to be regulated more tightly, or broken up so that no single entity controls all of its data. The company won’t protect us by itself, and nothing less than our democracy is at stake.","Sandy Parakilas worked as an operations manager on the platform team at Facebook in 2011 and 2012."],"isopubdate":"2282-10-07"}

That wasn’t its real victory.","Looking for news you can trust?Subscribe to our free newsletters.","1. “I can’t stand lying to you every day”","In the late summer of 2015, Chris Wilson, the director of research, analytics, and digital strategy for Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, had a conversation with a contractor that left him furious. A widely respected pollster who had taken leave from his firm to work full time for Cruz, Wilson oversaw a team of more than 40 data scientists, developers, and digital marketers, one of the largest departments inside Cruz’s Houston-based operation. The Iowa caucuses were fast approaching, and the Cruz campaign had poured nearly $13 million into winning the opening contest of the primary season.","As the campaign laid the groundwork for Iowa, a sizable chunk of its spending—$4.4 million and counting—flowed to a secretive company with British roots named Cambridge Analytica. A relative newcomer to American politics, the firm sold itself as the latest, greatest entrant into the burgeoning field of political technology. It claimed to possess detailed profiles on 230 million American voters based on up to 5,000 data points, everything from where you live to whether you own a car, your shopping habits and voting record, the medications you take, your religious affiliation, and the TV shows you watch. This data is available to anyone with deep pockets. But Cambridge professed to bring a unique approach to the microtargeting techniques that have become de rigueur in politics. It promised to couple consumer information with psychological data, harvested from social-media platforms and its own in-house survey research, to group voters by personality type, pegging them as agreeable or neurotic, confrontational or conciliatory, leaders or followers. It would then target these groups with specially tailored images and messages, delivered via Facebook ads, glossy mailers, or in-person interactions. The company’s CEO, a polo-playing Eton graduate named Alexander Nix, called it “our secret sauce.”","As a rule, Nix said his firm generally steered clear of working in British politics to avoid controversy in its own backyard. But it had no qualms applying its mind-bending techniques to a foreign electorate. “It’s someone else’s political system,” explains one former Cambridge employee, a British citizen. “It’s not ours. None of us would ever consider doing what we were doing here.”","Brought to Cruz by two of the campaign’s biggest backers, hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, Cambridge Analytica was put in charge of the entire data and digital operation, embedding 12 of its employees in Houston. The company, largely owned by Robert Mercer, said it had something special for Cruz. According to marketing materials obtained by Mother Jones, it pitched a “revolutionary” piece of software called Ripon, an all-in-one tool that let a campaign manage its voter database, microtargeting efforts, door-to-door canvassing, low-dollar fundraising, and surveys. Ripon, Cambridge vowed, was “the future of campaigning.” (The name is a clever bit of marketing: Ripon is the small town in Wisconsin where the Republican Party was born.)","The Cruz campaign believed Ripon might give it an edge in a crowded field of Republican hopefuls. But the software wasn’t ready right away. According to former Cruz staffers, Wilson inquired about Ripon’s status daily. It was almost finished, he was repeatedly told. Weeks passed, then months. Finally, in August 2015, one of the Cambridge consultants in Houston came clean. Ripon “doesn’t exist,” he told Wilson, according to several former Cruz staffers. “It’ll never exist. I’ve just resigned because I can’t stand lying to you every day anymore.” The campaign had hired Cambridge in the belief it could use Ripon to help win Cruz the nomination; instead, it was paying millions of dollars to build the Ripon technology. “It was like an internal Ponzi scheme,” a former Cruz campaign official told me.","The Cruz campaign couldn’t fire Cambridge outright. The Mercers wouldn’t be happy, and the campaign was too far along to ax a significant part of its digital staff. Still, Cruz officials steadily reduced Cambridge’s role. Even though the campaign used Cambridge’s psychological data in Iowa, Cruz’s victory there in February 2016 did nothing to quell the growing distrust campaign officials felt toward the company.","The Cruz team wasn’t alone in its doubts about the firm. Cambridge was also working, albeit in a more limited role, for rival Ben Carson’s campaign, whose experience with the company was similarly frustrating. Cambridge, for instance, sold itself as an expert in TV advertising yet failed to grasp basic facts about buying ads. Carson staffers came away feeling like Cambridge was at best in over its head and at worst a sham.","After Carson and Cruz dropped out and Trump all but clinched the nomination, Doug Watts, a senior staffer on the Carson campaign, got a call from Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman. “What do you know about Cambridge Analytica?” Manafort asked.","Watts replied that he didn’t think much of the firm. “They’re just full of shit, right?” Manafort said, according to Watts. “I don’t want ’em anywhere near the campaign.”","A few months later, on September 19, 2016, Alexander Nix strode onstage at the Concordia Annual Summit in Manhattan, a highbrow TED-meets-Davos confab. He was a featured speaker alongside Madeleine Albright, Warren Buffett, David Petraeus, and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Wired magazine had recently named him one of its “25 Geniuses Who Are Creating the Future of Business.”","In a dark tailored suit and designer glasses, wearing a signet ring on his left pinkie, Nix regaled the audience with the story of how Cambridge Analytica had turned Ted Cruz from an obscure and reviled US senator into “the only credible threat to the phenomenon Donald Trump.” Using Cambridge’s methods, the Cruz campaign had sliced and diced Iowa caucus-goers into hyperspecific groups based on their personality traits and the issues they cared about, such as the Second Amendment. As Nix clicked through his slides, he showed how it was possible to use so-called psychographics—a fancy term for measuring attitudes and interests of individuals—to narrow the universe of Iowans from the tens of thousands down to a single persuadable voter. In this case, Nix’s slide listed a man named Jeffrey Jay Ruest, a registered Republican born in 1963. He was “very low in neuroticism, quite low in openness, and slightly conscientious”—and would likely be receptive to a gun rights message.","“Clearly the Cruz campaign is over now,” he said as he finished his presentation, “but what I can tell you is that of the two candidates left in this election, one of them is using these technologies, and it’s going to be very interesting to see how they impact the next seven weeks.”","That candidate was Donald Trump. After Cruz dropped out in May 2016, the Mercers had quickly shifted their alliance to Trump, and his campaign hired their data firm over Manafort’s apparent objections. “Obviously he didn’t bargain for Rebekah Mercer being their big advocate,” Watts says. “So I presume he just capitulated.” Soon Trump jettisoned Manafort and installed in his place the Mercers’ political Svengali, Steve Bannon, who was also a board member, vice president, and part-owner of Cambridge Analytica.","“Nix the salesman is an artist, to be honest,” one colleague says. Another says, “He’ll always be like, ‘Can I give it a go? Can I sell this to you and work out the details afterward?'”","Come November 9, 2016, Cambridge wasted no time touting itself as a visionary that had seen Trump’s path to the White House when no one else did. Nix took an international victory lap to drum up new political business in Australia, India, Brazil, and Germany. Another Cambridge director gushed that the firm was receiving so much client interest that “it’s like drinking from a fire hose.”","Actually, the 2016 election was the high-water mark for Cambridge Analytica. Since then, the firm has all but vanished from the US political scene. According to Nix, this was by design. Late last year, he said his company had ceased pursuing new US political business. But recently, an extraordinary series of developments unfolded that led to Nix’s suspension as CEO and left the company’s future uncertain. A whistleblower went public with allegations, since cited in a class-action lawsuit, that the company had used unethical methods to obtain a massive trove of Facebook data to fuel its psychographic tactics.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,” Chris Wylie, who helped launch the company, told the British Observer. “That was the basis the entire company was built on.” Next came the release of an undercover investigation by the United Kingdom’s Channel 4, which captured video of Nix and other Cambridge executives explaining how they could covertly inject propaganda “into the bloodstream to the internet.” They also described how their services could include bribing a politician and recording undercover video or sending “very beautiful” Ukrainian “girls” to entrap a candidate.","The fallout was swift. Facebook, already under fire for facilitating the spread of disinformation, suspended Cambridge from its platform. British officials sought a warrant to search the company’s office. Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic demanded answers. “They should be barred from any US election or government work until a full investigation can be conducted,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted.","The story of Cambridge Analytica’s rise—and its rapid fall—in some ways parallels the ascendance of the candidate it claims it helped elevate to the presidency. It reached the apex of American politics through a mix of bluffing, luck, failing upward, and—yes—psychological manipulation. Sound familiar?","Like Trump, Nix was a master of hype who peddled a story that people wanted to believe. Take Jeffrey Ruest, the voter Nix identified at the Concordia Summit, down to the latitude and longitude of his home, to illustrate the firm’s psychographic prowess in Iowa. The message was that Cambridge had the ability to peer into the minds of—and to persuade—voters on the most granular level. Ruest wouldn’t have been useful to Cruz or any of his GOP rivals in Iowa, though. He lives a thousand miles away in North Carolina. But why let inconvenient details interfere with the perfect pitch?","2. “We called him Mr. Bond”","“We use the same techniques as Aristotle and Hitler,” the consultant said. “We appeal to people on an emotional level to get them to agree on a functional level.”","The year was 1992. The consultant was Nigel Oakes, a former Monte Carlo TV producer and ad man for Saatchi & Saatchi, and he was speaking to the trade magazine Marketing. Oakes was then running the Behavioural Dynamics Institute, a “research facility for understanding group behaviour” and for harnessing the power of psychology to craft messages that change hearts and minds. But in reality, Oakes’ institute was a stalking horse for the company he would launch the year after the interview.","Strategic Communication Laboratories, the public affairs company that would later spawn Cambridge Analytica, began small, applying its behavioral-science-minded approach to public influence campaigns in the United Kingdom, including one that, it boasts, rescued Lloyd’s of London by convincing Britons to invest another $1.5 billion in the ailing insurance market. But SCL soon branched into politics. Oakes says he advised Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress on how to prevent violence during the 1994 elections, as well as politicians in Asia, South America, and Europe. In 2000, the government of Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, who was struggling to contain the violence and upheaval in his country, hired Oakes to burnish his image, which involved building an elaborate media command center in Jakarta for monitoring and shaping public sentiment. “We called him Mr. Bond because he is English,” one of Oakes’ Indonesian employees told the Independent, “and because he is such a mystery.”","Data expert Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica","Mother Jones illustration","In 2005, SCL expanded into military and defense, pitching the use of “psychological operations” and “soft power” in the war on terror. The firm began picking up major clients, including the Pentagon and the UK Ministry of Defense, advising them on which Afghan leaders to target with counterinsurgency messages or how to dissuade teenage boys from joining Al Qaeda.","The company had meanwhile hired Nix, a former financial analyst, to grow its nondefense business. Former colleagues say he was just the man for the job. “Nix the salesman is an artist, to be honest,” one told me. Another referred to him as a “chancer,” the British term for a consummate opportunist. “He’ll always be like, ‘Can I give it a go?’” the colleague said. “‘Can I sell this to you and work out the details afterward?’”","Nix had an eye on the United States, where the courts were stripping away restrictions on political spending and empowering a new class of individual megadonors. He traveled here in 2010 to get the lay of the land but came away discouraged. Political consultants picked sides in America, he learned. A British outfit that worked with both left- and right-of-center clients might struggle to break into the market.","Then, on Election Day in November 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney watched as his campaign’s voter-turnout app, code-named Project Orca, crashed. It was humiliating but indicative of a larger dynamic: Democrats, powered by President Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 runs, had gained a huge advantage over their Republican counterparts in the realms of data and technology. The GOP’s 2012 postmortem report called for a cultural shift inside the party to embrace new tools and methodologies to win. “We have to be the Party that is open and ready to rebuild our entire playbook,” it read, “and we must take advice from outside our comfort zone.”","Nix saw his opening. SCL had recently rebranded itself as an expert in data analytics, the sifting and distilling of vast amounts of information from different sources into actionable outcomes. That skill set, combined with SCL’s previous work in microtargeting and psy-ops, made it an ideal candidate to find an audience in the world of Republican politics. “The Republicans had been left behind,” Nix later said. “By the time Romney lost in 2012, there was a vacuum. And so that was the commercial opportunity.”","Nix was soon introduced to Chris Wylie, then a twentysomething Canadian technologist. Wylie had worked under Obama’s director of targeting and consulted for Canada’s Liberal Party. Nix hired him and put him to work building a company that could attract clients in the hypercompetitive US political market. Wylie, for his part, had an idea about how his new employer, SCL, might gain an edge.","In 2007, David Stillwell, then a Ph.D. student in psychology, stumbled onto a digital gold mine. He’d always wondered about his personality and how he would score in the five-factor model, a personality test that measures openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Known as Ocean, this model is widely used by psychologists. But one challenge they encountered when applying it to different areas—marketing, relationships, politics—was gathering sufficient data. People naturally hesitate to give personal information about their fears, desires, and motivations.","Stillwell knew a little code, so he pulled certain Big Five questionnaires off the internet, stuck them in a quiz format, and uploaded an app to Facebook called myPersonality. It quickly went viral. Millions of people took the quiz, and with their permission, Stillwell went on to accumulate data on personality traits and Facebook habits for 4 million of them.","Using this data, Stillwell, now working at the University of Cambridge’s Psychometrics Centre, and two other researchers published a paper in 2013 in which they showed how you could predict an individual’s skin color or sexuality based on her Facebook “likes.” They found a correlation between high intelligence and likes of “thunderstorms,” “The Colbert Report,” and “curly fries,” while users who liked the Hello Kitty brand tended to be high on openness and lower on conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability.","Stillwell told me that as an afterthought, he and his co-authors threw in some language at the end about the commercial possibilities of their findings. The paper attracted the attention of companies looking to leverage Facebook and other social-media data for their own purposes. One person who took a keen interest was SCL’s Chris Wylie.","According to emails obtained by Mother Jones, Wylie approached Stillwell and a colleague via a fellow faculty member, a young Russian American professor named Aleksandr Kogan, hoping to cut a deal in which the firm would get access to Stillwell’s data.","Stillwell hadn’t heard of SCL. But he agreed to a meeting. When dates were circulated between the Cambridge academics and the SCL representatives, the title wasn’t subtle: “Panopticon meeting.” (Panopticon refers to a prison or building constructed so that all parts of it are visible by a single watchman but the surveilled can’t see who’s viewing them.) In the end, Stillwell decided not to partner with SCL.","Undeterred, SCL instead hired Kogan, who went on to create his own Facebook app, “thisisyourdigitallife.” As detailed in a class-action suit against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the app—which purported to be for academic research—not only collected personality data on the 270,000 people who took the quiz but also let Kogan vacuum up Facebook user data on all their friends. The Washington Post reported in late March that Facebook separately provided Kogan with data on 57 billion friendships as part of his work with two of the company’s data scientists between 2013 and 2015. Around the same time he was mining Facebook data, Kogan also forged a relationship with Saint Petersburg University, which hired him as an associate professor and provided him with research funding. He denies this research had any connection to his work for SCL.","According to Wylie, Kogan acquired more than 50 million profiles. He says Kogan then passed that data to SCL—in apparent violation of Facebook’s terms of use—in order to build its psychographic profiling methods. “Everyone knew we were wading into a gray area,” Wylie later said. “It was an instance of if you don’t ask questions, you won’t get an answer you don’t like.” (Kogan denies any wrongdoing: “My view is that I’m being basically used as a scapegoat.”)","Nix now had his calling card. SCL would break into the $10 billion American political market by pitching itself as a “cutting-edge” consultancy using “behavioral microtargeting”—that is, influencing voters based not on their demographics but on their personalities—and sophisticated data modeling to win elections. His timing couldn’t have been better.","3. “Marketing materials aren’t given under oath.”","One day in 2013, a knockabout Republican political consultant named Mark Block and his colleague boarded a flight from Los Angeles to New York. As the plane took off, they got to talking with the man seated next to them, an ex-military officer who mentioned he worked as a subcontractor for a company seeking US political clients. “They do cyberwarfare for elections,” the subcontractor said. Block dozed off as his colleague and her seatmate continued to chat. When they landed, his colleague told him excitedly that they needed to talk to a guy named Alexander Nix.","Not long after, they met with Nix in a conference room in the Willard InterContinental hotel, a stone’s throw from the White House. The meeting lasted more than six hours, Block recalls, as Nix described how they could use personality data and psychographics in American campaigns. “By the time he was done, I’m going like, ‘Holy shit,’” Block told me. “I had been aware of what Obama had done…But this seemed to be light-years ahead.”","At a subsequent meeting Block attended, Nix was introduced to Rebekah Mercer, who was quickly becoming one of the biggest donors in Republican politics. Bekah, as she’s known to friends, is the middle daughter of Robert Mercer, a billionaire computer scientist who pioneered the use of algorithms in investing at the Long Island-based hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. Bekah is the political animal of the Mercer family, and in the late 2000s and early 2010s she plowed $35 million from her family foundation into conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation, the Federalist Society, and the Heartland Institute. The Mercers also invested a reported $10 million in Breitbart News in 2011. They’ve donated millions to Republican candidates and super-PACs, from Mitt Romney and Herman Cain to a congressional candidate in Oregon named Arthur Robinson, who caught Robert Mercer’s attention with a pseudoscientific newsletter in which he argued that small amounts of nuclear radiation have health benefits.","Quid Pro Mercer","How the megadonors have leveraged their political spending into profits for their data firm","Olivia Exstrum","The Mercers had attended the semiannual donor retreats organized by Charles and David Koch and had, according to a source familiar with their political work, invested in the Kochs’ data venture, Themis (named for the Greek goddess of wisdom and order), which was supposed to close the gap with Democrats in the data arms race. But after Romney’s loss in 2012, the Mercers were fed up. Bekah Mercer turned heads at a 2012 postmortem event at the University Club in Manhattan when she excoriated the Romney campaign for its lackluster data operation. According to people familiar with the Mercers’ thinking, Bekah and her father set out to find their own data geniuses.","Over lunch in Manhattan, Bekah listened intently as Nix gave his pitch. When he finished, she said, “I really want you to tell this to my dad.” She gave him an address with instructions to meet later that day. At the appointed time, Nix and Block arrived at a grungy sports bar on the Hudson River, north of the city. “We’re going like, ‘What the fuck?’” Block says. Bekah texted to say she and her father would soon arrive. Moments later, Sea Owl, the Mercer family’s 203-foot superyacht, pulled up to the dock behind the sports bar.","Aboard the yacht, Nix took a seat next to Robert Mercer, opened his Mac, and launched into his spiel again. Bekah sat next to her father on the couch. Behind them stood Steve Bannon, the investment banker turned Hollywood producer and conservative activist who took over Breitbart News after the death of Andrew Breitbart. Whatever Nix told the Mercers that day in 2013, it worked: They agreed to invest a reported $15 million in a new company that would be the face of SCL’s American political work. Bannon was given a seat on the board and a stake in the new company to help, as Nix later said, the firm navigate the US political scene. Nix installed himself in Mercerworld, presenting himself as Bekah Mercer’s political guru and taking meetings at the Breitbart Embassy, the Capitol Hill row house that served as the conservative website’s offices and Bannon’s crash pad. The company was incorporated in Delaware on December 31, 2013. The name was a mix of old and new: Cambridge Analytica.","But if the Mercers had paid closer attention to a test run of Nix’s venture in the 2013 Virginia governor’s race, they might have reconsidered going into business with SCL. A PAC, the Middle Resolution, had paid Nix’s company several hundred thousand dollars that year for a list of persuadable voters to help elect Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who was running for governor. Months passed, and the list never arrived. When the group’s founder, Bob Bailie, demanded the list, Nix asked for more money and Bailie cut bait. Another Virginia-based group, Americans for Limited Government, then paid SCL $100,000 to create a list of suburban female voters who traditionally supported Democrats but might be swayed to vote for Cuccinelli if shown the right message. Late in the race, the group’s canvassers took Nix’s list into the field and returned with a perplexing result: The people on it were already Cuccinelli supporters. The higher-ups at Americans for Limited Government asked another firm to analyze the list. It turned out SCL had handed them a roster of die-hard Republicans.","Despite these early missteps, Cambridge Analytica quickly signed on a host of new clients thanks to the Mercers, who leveraged their position as megadonors to effectively strong-arm politicians into using their new firm. “It was the Mercers that made people work with us,” an early Cambridge employee told me. Cambridge boasted eight clients at the federal level in 2013 and 2014, and members of the Mercer family have supplied financial backing to each of them, including to five during that election cycle. One was former Ambassador John Bolton’s super-PAC, a potential vehicle for a presidential run. During the 2014 midterms, Robert Mercer gave $1 million to the group, which soon paid Cambridge more than $340,000 to develop Cambridge’s personality-based targeting on the issue of national security. It was an odd arrangement: Recipients of Mercer money would turn around and pay a vendor partly owned by the Mercers. (Rebekah Mercer did not respond to requests for comment.)","“Maybe [hacked information] was actually given to a campaign to help with the microtargeting. That’s why I think the role of Cambridge Analytica…needs to be looked at very carefully.”","Cambridge Analytica’s work in the 2014 midterms received mixed reviews. A consultant for Thom Tillis’ US Senate race in North Carolina singled out for praise a Cambridge contractor who had embedded with the campaign. But in other instances, the firm’s seemingly weak grasp of American politics turned off operatives. Once, a Cambridge employee appeared unaware what a precinct was. In another case, according to a prominent Republican consultant, Cambridge proposed influencing Republican voters living overseas by creating a model that targeted all absentee voters, suggesting that the firm didn’t realize that people who live in the United States can also vote absentee.","The most common criticism I heard about Nix was that he habitually overpromised and underdelivered. According to a person who worked with him, Nix had a saying: “Marketing materials aren’t given under oath.” (Nix, Cambridge, and SCL did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this story.)","But Nix and his company used their work helping to elect Tillis and another Mercer-backed candidate, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, as a steppingstone. Cambridge explored new corporate clients, pitching the Colorado-based DISH Network. (“DISH does not have, nor has it ever had, a business relationship with Cambridge Analytica,” a spokesman said.)","Perhaps inspired by Bannon, whom Wylie described to the Washington Post as “Nix’s boss,” the company began testing messages designed to tap into immigration fears, anti-government sentiment, and an affinity for strongmen—“build the wall,” “drain the swamp,” “race realism” (a euphemism for rolling back civil rights protections). It also surveyed opinions about Russian President Vladimir Putin. It seemed as if they were getting ready for a presidential campaign—but which one?","4. “They’ve gotten the wool pulled over their eyes”","At 8:05 p.m. on March 22, 2015, Ted Cruz’s personal Twitter account posted a message: “Tonight around midnight there will be some news you won’t want to miss. Stay tuned…” There wasn’t much suspense—Cruz had effectively launched his presidential bid the day he arrived in the Senate two years earlier, but now he would make it official.","At midnight, the senator’s team in Houston would turn on the campaign website built by Cambridge Analytica. Then, at 12:01 a.m.…nothing. “We couldn’t even get the website up,” one former Cruz staffer told me. Eight excruciating minutes passed before Cruz simply sent another tweet: “I’m running for President and I hope to earn your support!”","It was a harbinger of things to come. Interviews with eight people who worked on the Cruz campaign reveal a litany of disputes with Nix. As the campaign’s frustrations mounted, it winnowed the number of Cambridge staffers in Houston from 12 to 3.","Cruz’s campaign did, however, employ Cambridge’s psychographic models, especially in the run-up to Iowa. According to internal Cambridge memos, the firm devised four personality types of possible Cruz voters—“timid traditionalists,” “stoic traditionalists,” “temperamental” people, and “relaxed leaders.” The memos laid out how the campaign should talk to each group about Cruz’s marquee issues, such as abolishing the IRS or stopping the Iran nuclear deal. A timid traditionalist, the memo said, was someone who was “highly emotional” but valued “order and structure in their lives.” For this kind of person, an “Abolish the IRS” message should be presented as something that “will bring more/restore order to the system.” Recommended images included “a family having a nice moment together, with a smaller image representing Washington off to the side—representing that a small state makes for better private moments.” But for a temperamental type, the suggested image was a “young man tossing away a tax return and taking the key of his motorbike to head out for a ride.”","Almost two months before the Iowa caucus, the Guardian reported that Cambridge and the Cruz campaign were using unauthorized Facebook data—an early indication of what Chris Wylie would later reveal in full. In response, Facebook told Cambridge to delete any Facebook data it held. Wylie says that while he deleted the data in his possession, he merely filled out a form and sent it back to Facebook certifying that he’d deleted the information. Facebook, he adds, never verified whether he actually had. A former Cruz staffer told me that well after the Guardian report, he could still use Cambridge’s Facebook data to build voter models.","Doug Chayka","The Cruz campaign eked out a victory in Iowa, and Nix was quick to take credit during an interview on Fox News. Whether Cambridge’s psychographics played any part in Cruz’s win is debatable: When the firm began using these techniques on December 1, two months before the caucus, Cruz was polling at 28 percentage points in Iowa. From there to caucus day, his numbers fluctuated in the range between 23 and 32 percent. Contrary to Nix’s claim that Cruz was languishing in the single digits until Cambridge came along, the candidate was already well on his way to winning when Cambridge’s secret sauce kicked in. “If we weren’t using the personality stuff until that point in time,” a former Cruz official says, “then Nix can’t credibly make the argument that it mattered, right?”","Adding to suspicions about whether Cambridge’s personality profiling worked as claimed was the fact that the company refused to share any of its underlying models. Cambridge advised the campaign on how best to deliver Cruz’s message to “stoic traditionalists” and “relaxed leaders,” but it wouldn’t divulge how it came up with those personality types in the first place. “They’re the least transparent company in the business,” a former Cruz staffer told me. Nor did Cambridge seem to understand the fundamentals of how a presidential campaign operated: Two weeks out from the South Carolina primary, Cruz’s data team discovered that the company hadn’t updated the voter database feeding its models in seven months. The result: In a primary where the victory margin could be in the low thousands, there were 70,000 people Cruz wasn’t targeting because his data was stale. “How fucked up is that?” the former Cruz staffer told me. “That’s political malpractice.” Cruz finished third in South Carolina. After the opening four states, he stopped using Cambridge’s personality-profiling models.","The company’s lackluster performance on the Cruz campaign didn’t stop Nix from walking onstage at the Concordia Summit and taking credit for Cruz’s second-place finish in the nomination fight. Word of his speech spread in Cruz circles, and campaign alums watched the video of Nix and scoffed. “Most of that’s bullshit or things we designed on the campaign,” one senior Cruz staffer told me. “Everybody has respect for the Mercers. But they’ve gotten the wool pulled over their eyes.”","5. “The phenomenon Donald Trump”","The Cruz campaign was still in the process of unwinding when Cambridge, following the lead of its investors, the Mercers, offered its services to the Trump campaign. Cambridge had previously reached out to Trump’s team, but his advisers didn’t want to hire the firm if it was also working for his rivals. Now, this was no longer an issue. Nix sent three employees to Texas to meet with Brad Parscale, Trump’s head of digital operations, who had no political experience and had gotten to know the Trump family while building websites for their company. (Parscale was recently named Trump’s 2020 campaign manager.)","As Nix courted the Trump campaign, he came up with an idea to boost the GOP nominee-in-waiting—one that was more in line with the political dirty tricks he and his colleagues would later discuss with Channel 4’s undercover reporter. WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange had recently told a British TV station that he had come into possession of internal emails belonging to senior Clinton campaign officials—the result of a cyberattack later revealed to be the work of Russian hackers. Nix reached out to Assange via his speaking agency, seeking a meeting. Nix reportedly hoped to get access to the emails and help Assange share them with the public—that is, he wanted to weaponize the information. According to both Nix and Assange, the WikiLeaks founder passed on his offer.","Nevertheless, by late June Nix had landed a contract with the Trump team. At first, a handful of Cambridge employees set up shop in San Antonio, where Parscale was running Trump’s digital operation out of his marketing firm’s offices. But Matt Oczkowski, Cambridge’s head of product, was eventually put in charge of the San Antonio office after Parscale relocated to campaign headquarters in Trump Tower.","What exactly Cambridge Analytica did for Trump remains murky, though in the days after the election, Nix’s firm blasted out one press release after another touting the “integral” and “pivotal” role it played in Trump’s shocking upset. Nix later told Channel 4’s undercover reporter that Cambridge deserved much of the credit for Trump’s win. “We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy,” he said. Another Cambridge executive suggested the firm had delivered Trump victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—states crucial to his ultimate win. “When you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million votes but won the Electoral College vote, that’s down to the data and the research.”","Cambridge helped run an anti-Hillary Clinton online ad campaign for a Mercer-funded super-PAC that paid the company $1.2 million. The ads stated that Clinton “might be the first president to go to jail” and echoed conspiracy theories about her health. But according to multiple Republican sources familiar with Cambridge’s work for Trump, the firm played at best a minor role in Trump’s victory. Parscale has said that $5 million of the $5.9 million the Trump campaign paid Cambridge was for a large TV ad buy. When Cambridge bungled that—some of the ads wound up running in the District of Columbia, a total waste of money—the firm was not used for future ad buys. During an interview with 60 Minutes last fall, Parscale dismissed the company’s psychographic methods: “I just don’t think it works.” Trump’s secret strategy, he said, wasn’t secret at all: The campaign went all-in on Facebook, making full use of the platform’s advertising tools. “Donald Trump won,” Parscale said, “but I think Facebook was the method.”","Nix, however, seemed determined to capitalize on Trump’s victory. Cambridge opened a new office a few blocks from the White House, where Bannon would soon take on his new role as Trump’s chief political strategist. (Bannon retained his stake in the firm, valued between $1 million and $5 million, until April 2017, months after Trump took office.) SCL, its UK-based affiliate, eventually relocated its global headquarters from London to Arlington, Virginia, and began chasing government work, quickly landing a $500,000 State Department contract to monitor the impact of foreign propaganda. SCL briefly signed on Lt. General Michael Flynn as an adviser and later hired a former Flynn associate to run its DC office.","“Alexander was always entertaining,” a former colleague says. “In the end, he will always hang himself.”","But even as Nix jetted around the globe and Cambridge opened new offices in Brazil and Malaysia, the company found itself with few allies in the United States. Trump campaign alums and Republican Party staffers distanced themselves from the company—especially after news broke last October that Nix had communicated with Assange. “We were proud to have worked with the RNC and its data experts and relied on them as our main source for data analytics,” Michael Glassner, the Trump campaign’s executive director, said in a statement released in response to these reports. “Any claims that voter data from any other source played a key role in the victory are false.”","By late 2017, after giving every indication that Cambridge Analytica intended to be a major player in American politics, Nix told Forbes the firm was no longer “chasing any US political business,” a decision he framed as a strategic move. “There’s going to be literally dozens and dozens of political firms [working in 2018], and we thought that’s a lot of mouths to feed and very little food on the table.” This seemed dubious—working on a winning presidential race is a golden ticket that most consultants would dine out on for years. In reality, Cambridge Analytica’s reputation for spotty work had circulated widely among Democratic and Republican operatives, who were also put off by Nix’s grandstanding and self-promotion. Mark Jablonowski, a partner at the firm DSPolitical, told me that there was “basically a de facto blacklist” of the firm and “a consensus Cambridge Analytica had overhyped their supposed accomplishments.” Perhaps even worse for a company that had relied on its billionaire patrons to open doors to new clients, the Mercers ceased “flogging for” Cambridge, according to Doug Watts, the former Ben Carson staffer.","For any upstart company, this would have constituted a crisis. But being shunned from the American political scene, it turned out, was just the start of Cambridge’s problems.","6. “I am aware how this looks”","Nix was near his London office when a Channel 4 correspondent confronted him. “Have you ever used entrapment in the past?” the reporter asked, thrusting a microphone in Nix’s face. “Is it time for you to abandon your political work?”","Captured on tape musing about entrapment and spreading untraceable propaganda, accused of misappropriating Facebook data to meddle with the minds of American voters—by March 20, scandal had reached Nix’s doorstep. He brushed past the reporter and into his building.","“I am aware how this looks,” Nix said in a statement. He explained that the explosive comments he and his colleagues had made to an undercover reporter were untrue. They were just “playing along” with “ludicrous hypothetical scenarios” proposed by a prospective client. His company, meanwhile, claimed that it did not “use or hold data from Facebook profiles.” By the end of the day, Cambridge Analytica had suspended Nix pending an investigation, and he had offered to resign if it would spare the company. “Alexander was always entertaining,” a former colleague told me. “In the end, he will always hang himself.”","The revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s alleged political tricks and shady data mining added to a growing list of problems the company was already facing. A few months earlier, in December, Nix had appeared before the House Intelligence Committee—though not in person. The panel’s Republicans, who ran the committee’s Russia probe with an eye toward minimizing any political damage to the president, arranged for Nix to beam in by video link. One topic of discussion was Nix’s outreach to WikiLeaks. His testimony remains secret, though he subsequently acknowledged approaching Assange in an effort to get his hands on “information that could be incredibly relevant to the outcome of the US election.” (In the Channel 4 undercover footage, Nix mocked the Intelligence Committee and said the Republican members asked him only three questions. “Five minutes—done,” he said, adding, “They’re politicians; they’re not technical. They don’t understand how it works.”)","From left: Rebekah Mercer, Christopher Wylie and Steve Bannon","Mother Jones illustration","The committee’s Democrats had taken a keen interest in Trump’s data operation and Cambridge Analytica’s role in particular. Michael Bahar, a former general counsel on the committee who worked on the investigation before entering private practice, told me that one line of inquiry explored whether Cambridge Analytica had deployed its targeting tactics to more effectively spread Russian disinformation, and whether it had been enlisted to use data and analytics stolen from the Democratic National Committee by Russian-directed hackers. “Maybe [hacked information] was actually given to a campaign to help with the microtargeting,” Bahar says. “That’s why I think the role of Cambridge Analytica…needs to be looked at very carefully.”","Scrutiny will likely intensify given revelations that Cambridge’s Russian connections predated the 2016 election. Wylie, the former Cambridge employee, provided documents to the Observer revealing that the firm briefed Lukoil, the Russian oil company, on its behavioral microtargeting strategies. In a recent interview with CNN, Wylie drew a startling connection between the firm’s work and the Russian cyberattacks during the election. “I am concerned that we made Russia aware of the programs that we were working on,” he said, “and that might have sparked an idea that eventually led to some of the disinformation programs that we have seen.”","In addition to Nix, Democrats, according to a House Intelligence Committee memo, had hoped to call as witnesses Alex Tayler, Cambridge Analytica’s chief data officer; Julian Wheatland, the chairman of SCL; and Rebekah Mercer. Instead, in early March, committee Republicans hastily shut down the probe, though Democrats have vowed to continue investigating on their own, although without subpoena power. On March 21, the committee’s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), wrote to Aleksandr Kogan seeking an interview and requesting documents about his interactions with SCL and Cambridge Analytica. Chris Wylie has agreed to meet with committee Democrats.","The firm also remains a subject of interest to special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. According to the Wall Street Journal, Mueller last fall requested the emails of any Cambridge employee who worked on the Trump campaign. Nix’s unguarded comments to Channel 4 may be of interest. He said the firm relied on an encrypted email system that deleted messages two hours after they were read. “So then there’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing.”","Yet another avenue of interest for investigators is Cambridge’s possible role in a second 2016 election that featured covert Russian meddling—the British referendum to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. In 2016, Cambridge seemed to break its informal rule of forgoing UK political work when it unveiled a partnership with Leave.EU, the more extreme of the pro-Brexit campaigns, only to backtrack and deny any involvement in Brexit.","In February, as part of a broader inquiry into fake news, members of the British Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee grilled Nix for more than two hours. He unconvincingly blamed the announcement of the Leave.EU partnership on “a slightly overzealous PR consultant.” He claimed that he and his staff had “never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country.” And he denied that his firm used Facebook data. After the latest round of revelations, Damian Collins, a conservative member of Parliament who chairs the committee, said Nix had “deliberately misled” his panel “by giving false statements” and vowed to further investigate.","The blowback from the Cambridge Analytica scandals also hit Facebook, which faced a torrent of criticism for its lax handling of users’ data. The company’s stock price tumbled by 7 percent, losing more than $50 billion in value, and the Federal Trade Commission reportedly launched an investigation into its data practices. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally broke his silence, issuing a statement admitting to a “breach of trust” between Facebook and its users.","Yet, critics wondered, just how many times had their trust been breached? Cambridge Analytica was hardly alone in hoovering up user data. And how exactly were Cambridge Analytica’s psychographic techniques different from Facebook’s core business model—tapping into the vast amounts of data it collects on its users to guide hypertargeted advertising, be it for shoe companies or political campaigns or dubious fake news sites.","By most accounts, Cambridge Analytica’s main feat of political persuasion was convincing a group of Republican donors, candidates, and organizations to hand over millions of dollars. (A company called Emerdata that lists Nix as a director recently added Rebekah Mercer and another Mercer daughter to its board, suggesting that Nix hasn’t fallen out with all his GOP patrons.) But Cambridge’s controversial foray into US politics spawned larger questions about how our social-media habits can be turned against us, and how companies such as Facebook hold more power over our lives—the ability to shape public conversation, even political outcomes—than many people are comfortable with. Whether or not Cambridge Analytica survives, data about our personality types, our predilections, our hopes and fears—information we unwittingly divulge via status updates, tweets, likes, and photos—will increasingly be used to target us as voters and consumers, for good and ill, and often without our knowledge.

The idea, in theory, would let Snapchat users grant outside companies access to their Snapchat data to help personalize other services.","Mashable saw a beta version of Snapchat with a new section called “Connected Apps,” with text that reads, “These apps are connected to your Snapchat account. Choose an app to control what it has access to.”","Snapchat currently has an advertising API so people can buy ads through third-party dashboards, but it doesn’t let people use their Snapchat account on other apps, or help people connect with their Snapchat friends on other platforms.","Facebook does, and has for years. An old version of that API, which allowed outside developers to collect data from users without their consent, is at the center of the company’s entire Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The fact that Snapchat is considering sharing some data with outsiders is interesting in general, but particularly interesting given the recent news about Facebook.","There are a lot more questions than answers about the potential product. For example, what would connecting your Snapchat account to another app actually grant that developer? Would they have access to your contact list or private Snap messages? Would Snapchat let you post back to your account from other services?","A Snap spokesperson declined to comment, and the company is likely thinking a lot about those very questions, given the current climate around privacy sharing. Hopefully, Snapchat will learn from Facebook‘s mistakes whenever it decides to roll this out.","Until now, Snap has stayed pretty far out of the spotlight when it comes to data collection and user privacy, probably because so many of the interactions on Snap are in private messages. (And many of its users are smartphone natives who may better understand what they’re handing over— or simply not care.)","But Snap is also an advertising company like Facebook, and it collects a lot of data about its users so it can show them relevant ads. You can read about some of that here.","The fact that it’s considering an API is also a reminder of why Facebook continues to collect this kind of stuff about its own user base, despite the issues it’s facing — if Facebook isn’t going to do it, somebody else will."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the U.S. presidential election."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Cambridge Analytica is being criticized for violating the privacy of millions of unsuspecting people to help Trump, while Facebook is being accused of potentially breaking American and British laws for failing to disclose to users that their data had been used by an outside firm.","Cambridge Analytica has also been accused of knowingly employing non-American citizens to work on the 2016 presidential election, despite the fact that this violated federal law, according to The Guardian. Many of its methods were exposed in a recent piece from The Guardian that profiled eventual whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who, along with consulting company Strategic Communication Laboratories (which is the parent to Cambridge Analytica) and University of Cambridge professor Dr. Aleksandr Kogan had their accounts suspended by Facebook on Friday night. Facebook is also looking into the ties between one of its employees, Joseph Chancellor, and Global Science Research, a company that helped Cambridge Analytica, according to CNN.","One Facebook executive, Andrew Bosworth, took to Twitter to defend his company.","We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies.

It is creating an echo chamber in the name of connection. It surfaces the divisive and destroys the real reason we began using social media in the first place – human connection.","It is a cancer.","I’ve begun the slow process of weaning myself off of the platform by methodically running a script that will delete my old content. And there’s a lot. There are likes and shares. There are long posts I wrote to impress my friends. There are thousands of WordPress notifications that tell the world what I’m doing. In fact, I would wager I use Facebook more to broadcast my ego than interact with real humans. And I suspect that most of us are in a similar situation.","There is a method to my madness. I like Facebook Messenger and I like that Facebook is now a glorified version of OAuth. It’s a useful tool when it is stripped of its power. However, when it is larded with my personal details it is a weapon and a liability.","Think about it: any posts older than about a week are fodder for bots and bad actors. Posts from 2016? 2017? Why keep them? No one will read them, no one cares about them. Those “You and Joe have known each other for five years” auto-posts are fun but does anyone care? Ultimately you’ve created the largest dossier on yourself and you’ve done it freely, even gleefully. This dossier reflects your likes, your dislikes, your feelings, and political leanings. It includes clear pictures of your face from all angles, images of your pets and family, and details your travels. You are giving the world unfettered access to your life. It’s wonderful to imagine that this data will be used by a potential suitor who will fall in love with your street style. It’s wonderful to imagine you will scroll through Facebook at 80 and marvel at how you looked at the turn of the century. It’s wonderful to imagine that Facebook is a place to share ideas, dreams, and hopes, a human-to-human connection engine that gives more than it takes.","None of that will happen.","Facebook is a data collection service for those who want to sell you products. It is the definitive channel to target you based on age, sex, geographic location, political leanings, interests, and marital status. It’s an advertiser’s dream and it is wildly expensive in terms of privacy lost and cash spent to steal that privacy. It is the perfect tool for marketers, a user-generated paradise that is now run by devils.","Will you delete Facebook? Probably not. Will I? I’m working on it. I’ve already been deleting old tweets after realizing that border police and potential employers may use what I write publicly against me. I’m clearing out old social media accounts and, as I mentioned before, deleting old Facebook posts, thus ensuring that I will no longer be a target for companies like Cambridge Analytica. But we love our social media, don’t we? The power it affords. The feeling of connection. In the absence of human interaction we cling to whatever dark simulacrum is available. In the absence of the Town Square we talk to ourselves. In the absence of love and understanding we join the slow riot of online indifference.","When Travis Kalanick led his ride-sharing company down the dark path to paranoia, bro culture, and classist rantings we reacted by deleting the app. We didn’t want to do business with that particular brand of company. Yet we sit idly by while Facebook sells us out and its management pummels and destroys all competition.","I wish it didn’t have to be this way. There is plenty of good in these platforms but the dangers far outweigh the benefits. Try to recall the last time you were thankful for social media. I can. It happened twice. First, it happened when I posted on my “wall” a eulogy for my father who died in January. The outpouring of support was heartening in a dark time. It was wonderful to see friends and acquaintances tell me their own stories, thereby taking the sting out of my own. But months later that good feeling is gone, replaced by ads for fancy shoes and political rants. Out of the Facebook swamp sometimes surfaces a pearl. But it sinks just as quickly.","One more sad example: I found out, accidentally, that my friend’s wife died. It appeared on my feed as if placed there by some divine hand and I was thankful it surfaced. It beat out videos of Mister Rogers saying inspiring things and goofy pictures of Trump. It beat out ads and rants and questions about the best sushi restaurant in Scranton. The stark announcement left me crying and breathless. There it was in black and blue, splashed across her page: she was gone. There was the smiling photo of her two little children and there was the outpouring of grief under these once innocuous photos. Gone, it said. She was gone. I found out from her wall where her memorial service would be held and I finally reached back out to my old friend to try to comfort him in his grief. Facebook, in those two instances, worked.","But Facebook isn’t the only thing that can give us that feeling of connectedness. We’ve had it for centuries.","Facebook simply replaced the tools we once used to tell the world of our joys and sorrows and it replaced them with cheap knock-offs that make us less connected, not more. Decades ago, on one coal-fogged winter morning in Krakow, Poland where I was living, I passed Kościół św. Wojciecha with its collection of nekrologi – necrologies – posted on a board in front of the church. There you saw the names of the dead – and sometimes the names of the newly born – and it was there you discovered what was happening in your little corner of the world. The church wasn’t far from the central square – the Rynek – and I walked there thinking about the endless parade of humanity that had walked across those cobbles, stopping for a moment in their hustle at the church yard to see who had died. I stood in the crisp air, flanked by centuries old brickwork, and imagined who once populated this place. This was the place you met your friends and your future partners. It was there you celebrated your successes and mourned your failures. It was there, among other humans, you told the world the story of your life, but told it slant. You witnessed kindnesses and cruelties, you built a world entire based on the happenings in a few square miles.","No more. Or, at least, those places are no longer available to most of us.","We’ve moved past the superstitions and mythologies of the past. Tools like Facebook were designed to connect us to the world, giving us an almost angelic view of daily happenstance. We replaced the churchyard with the “timeline.” But our efforts failed. We are still as closed, still full of superstition, as we were a hundred years ago. We traded a market square for the Internet but all of the closed-mindedness and cynicism came with it. We still disparage the outsider, we still rant against invisible enemies, and we still keep our friends close and fear what lies beyond our door. Only now we have the whole world on which to reflect our terror.","It doesn’t have to be this way. Maybe some day we’ll get the tools we need to interact with the world. Maybe they’re already here and we just don’t want to use them.","Until we find them, however, it’s probably better for us to delete the ones we use today."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The data inside was not particularly usable for a Facebook user, except on Facebook.","But with all the controversy surrounding Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data of 50 million user profiles was misused, many users are reexamining their own relationship with the platform and the data it has.","It takes a few minutes for Facebook to prepare your archive into a .zip file to download, and once it’s unzipped, you can view it by double-clicking on the file “index.htm.” (The interface is web-based and will open in a browser.)","What your archive says","Your digital life, compressed into an archive, may be bizarre to see. Your relationships, should you have made them public are front and center in your details. Your email addresses, the names you used on Facebook (I used a fake name until 2014), your workplaces (one of mine just says “yes yes hi hello”), and all the things you “liked.”","Over the years, Facebook had different ways to deal with that stuff, so everything doesn’t quite match up perfectly. There used to be a place for favorite movies and books, and most of that merged to a general “Other” category. (Except for the movies category, which for me still displays “Roadhouse.”)","Among the items in the file are your entire timeline, which includes posts from previous iterations of Facebook, when posting on people’s walls, which comprised the bulk of a user’s interactions on the platform. (Perhaps it was not even a platform yet.)","Everything you and others posted is there, including all the things people wrote, assuming they were simply shouting into the abyss, figuring no one was listening. Facebook was, and they wrote it down!","Also present are the ad topics Facebook thinks you’d be into, the ads you’ve actually clicked on — this doesn’t seem complete, it says I clicked on only a few in just 2018 — and the advertisers that possess your data. Some of them are really weird: A friend texted me to say that “Rod Stewart” is listed under the advertisers that have his data. My editor’s archive showed that a bunch of cruise lines — and the musician Beck – had her data. (She has no idea why, and when asked whether she even likes Beck said, “I don’t know?”)","Most unnerving perhaps, are the private messages, compiled in one place. We get new phones or clear our old phone texts, but Facebook doesn’t have storage issues. It’s all here.","All of this should not be news to you. Facebook’s 3 billion users give this information willingly, and we certainly expect the company not to delete old posts. But the archive, compiled for the benefit of the user, puts the concept into alarming relief, showing exactly how much of our lives we’ve poured into it. And of course, how easy it is to condense a digital life into a .zip file.","It’s scary, but it’s not a surprise","When you post a photo on Facebook, you expect it to be available — even years later. Recently, Facebook even made a feature on this, showing friend retrospectives for friend anniversaries in your newsfeed. Similarly, the motivation for the collection of some of this data – advertising – was detailed in the fine print. Unfortunately, most don’t read the fine print and thus miss this devil in the details. (Though the fact that a 13-year-old is expected to read and understand this may trouble some.)","How Facebook can interpret all this data may be of more interest. You can see what their conclusions are if you read this article. From the data you provide as a user, what you “like” on the platform, they can get a decent picture of who you are.","Another friend and Facebook user I talked with noted that it was interesting that people seem more concerned with “psychographic data” rather than the fact that Equifax exposed 150 million Social Security numbers, something that has identity theft and financial security implications. The answer, of course, is because there’s a small-ish .zip file —mine was 34 megabytes filled with secrets. If it got loose, it would be pure KOMPROMAT. (Update your password.)","From a personal data hygiene perspective, if all this doesn’t sit well with you, the only thing you can really do is delete the contacts you may have uploaded to Facebook. Though you can make things hidden, purging the site of your data seems to mean full-scale account deletion, if you want to set fire to your old activity."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.\"","Stamos advocated investigating and revealing manipulation of news at the social network by Russian entities, to the chagrin of other top executives, the Times reported, citing unnamed current and former employees.","Senator Ron Wyden asked Facebook to provide more information on what he called a \"troubling\" misuse of private data that could have been used to sway voters.","Wyden said he wants to know how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook tools \"to weaponise detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.\"","In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage.","Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations \"horrifying, if confirmed,\" and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week.","According to a joint investigation by The New York Times and Britain's Observer, Cambridge Analytica was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's Information Commissioner who regulates the sector in the country, announced her office would seek a court warrant on Tuesday to search Cambridge Analytica's computer servers.","She said the company had been \"uncooperative\" to requests for access to its records and missed a Monday deadline stipulated.","Meanwhile, Facebook said it has hired a digital forensics firm to examine how the data leak occurred and to ensure that any data collected had been destroyed.","Facebook shares skidded 6.8 per cent by the close of the Nasdaq amid concerns about pressure for new regulations that could hurt its business model.","Shares slipped another per cent or so to US$170 in after-market trades.","Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media, said the disclosures will increase pressure to regulate Facebook and other social media firms, already under scrutiny for allowing disinformation from Russian-directed sources to propagate.","\"Self-regulation is not working,\" Grygiel said.","Daniel Kreiss, a professor of media and communications at the University of North Carolina, said Facebook failed to live up to its responsibilities on election ads.","\"The fact that Facebook seems to make no distinction between selling sneakers and selling a presidential platform is a deep problem,\" Kreiss said.","Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research maintained that the revelations highlight \"systemic problems at Facebook,\" but that they won't immediately impact the social network's revenues.","David Carroll, a media professor at the Parsons School of Design, said Facebook and others will soon be forced to live with new privacy rules such as those set to take effect in the European Union.","\"Facebook and Google will have to ask users a lot more permission to track them,\" Carroll said. \"Most people are going to say no, so I think it's going to have a huge impact on these companies.\"","Carroll has filed a legal action in Britain calling on Cambridge Analytica to disclose what data was gathered and used on him.","An undercover investigation of Cambridge Analytica by Britain's Channel 4 said executives boasted they could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and Ukrainian sex workers, and spread misinformation online.","The executives claimed to have worked in more 200 elections across the world, including Argentina, the Czech Republic, India, Kenya and Nigeria.","The British firm said it \"strongly denies\" the claims from Channel 4 as well as reports on misuse of Facebook data.","\"Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign,\" a statement read.","ADVERTISEMENT","POST A COMMENT","HOUSE RULES","1.

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","On March 17, reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London suggested Trump-campaign linked UK-based political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had been able to buy data on 50 million Facebook users in 2015 to use for microtargeting political advertising.","The data had been gathered via a third party survey app running on Facebook’s platform and using its API to pull data on the friends of the 270,000 respondents who answered the survey.","At the weekend Facebook took out full page newspaper ads in the US and UK apologizing for failing to protect users’ information.","Billions have been wiped off the company’s share price since the scandal broke.","The company’s share price also fell more than 5% today, on the news of the FTC announcement.","The consumer watchdog previously investigated Facebook over deceptive privacy claims, back in 2011.","And in 2012, as part of an FTC settlement, Facebook promised it would give users “clear and prominent notice” and get their consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.","It also agree to two decades of biennial audits.","Facebook avoided a financial penalty at the time, though if the FTC goes on to decide the company violated that earlier initial agreement it could certainly be on the hook for fines — fines which the Washington Post has suggested could scale to trillions of dollars if the FTC’s $40,000 per privacy violation is multiplied by the 50M Facebook users whose data was passed to Cambridge Analytica.","Whatever any eventual financial penalty might be, the reputational damage Facebook is suffering as a result of this snowballing data handling scandal is bad enough, adding to calls for policymakers to regulate social media platforms.","We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the FTC’s announcement — at the time of writing the company had not responded. Update: In a statement, Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer said: “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign.

{"originalurl":"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/03/links-3-20-18.html","title":"Links 3/20/18 | naked capitalism","text":["Readers, per my post yesterday, Verizon is getting rid of copper in my local central office. Some readers have confirmed my take that this is illegal under common carrier regulations, and separately also not be allowed under the recent New York state copper settlement agreement. But Verizon appears to be taking advantage of the fact that the deal has been agreed but not yet approved by a court to establish “facts on the ground.”","So I’m still limping on the connectivity. Both my options, FIOS and Spectrum, get generally crappy reviews and have bad customer service. My experience with cable, and it seems to be true with FIOS, is they have just as many outages as DSL, and the outages last longer when they happen. I know some readers have piped up and claimed they’ve never had outages, but my building staff says tenants have complained about both FIOS and Spectrum outages. There are more complaints re FIOS, but that could be sample bias (with only 65 units in my building, having even one or two tenants with high service expectations on one or the other would skew results) or the caliber of customer service once you have an outage v. the amount of actual downtime. The latter is far and away the most important consideration for me, and despite DSL being antique, it performed well, including relative to cable from Spectrum when I’ve been staying with family or friends who use that for their broadband. (And do not forget that I listed wanting POTS for safety as a big reason to want to stick with copper, but that’s beside the point going forward.)","But for NYC readers only: If you have FIOS or Spectrum, how many outages have you had in the pst year or two? How long have they typically been? And can you get answers from tech support or customer service when they happen?","(See Terry Pratchett’s The Truth for a discussion of “fracas” vs. “rumpus.”) I’m actually a little baffled about where to file this material, since as an event the fracas begins as a “2016 Post Mortem,” but then ramifies outward to questions of valuation, the melding of the press, opposition researchers, the political class, and the intelligence community, besides raising privacy issues.","About Lambert Strether","Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered.\nTo me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.","Post navigation","189 comments","Another reason why I view going to major eastern seaboard cities akin to visiting third-world countries when I travel there from upstate NY. I was just visiting one of my kids in another eastern seaboard major city last week and had numerous, numerous disconnects of my VPN so I spent half of my work time just reconnecting to the Comcast wifi.","Returned to FIOS in upstate NY and no more disconnects.","So internet, traffic jams, incredibly crappy roads (especially in NYC), unbelievable bureaucracy (hello NYC Department of Buildings), mass transit that often has delays, fires etc. all give these cities a distinct third-world flair. Fabulous for the 1%, not so good for the rest.","I avoid eastern seaboard airports like the plague for connections due to frequent delays, missed connections, and generally poor airports, Flying through select “fly-over” hubs is usually much more reliable.","Agreed. I live upstate and have reached similar conclusions. Which is saying a lot given the fact that this region has been clobbered pretty hard over the past 40 years in the global/gig economy. But is there any region or city that does function pretty well? Maybe Minneapolis? Or not.","Most of the Fortune 100 plants in our area closed in the 80s and early 90s. By 2008, the old plants were actually filling up pretty well with small businesses, so we didn’t go through massive layoffs unlike the early 90s. House prices didn’t go up in the housing bubble and didn’t go down in the housing crash. A $60k income will buy you a decent home in a decent school district. In 2009 I was laughing about the fact that our economy had sucked for so long that we had adapted and we now had a diversified economy that many other areas now wanted.","Many people left the area, especially the younger folks, but if you have a good job, either blue collar or professional, then you can live comfortably. The poor in the urban centers and rural areas can be very poor with a lot of family challenges. However, a full-time job a couple of dollars above minimum wage can pull you into lower middle-class, especially if you do not have a child.","In general, I would say we have been in an equilibrium state for about 15-20 years. Local taxes are way too high, mainly because the county taxes pick up a big chunk of the NYS Medicaid funding. Shifting that to the General Funds would completely change the picture on local taxes and make these areas much more competitive.","Yikes, sounds like life is a lot worse in the big coastal cities than in Canada.","It used to be that well off people in Canada, especially Atlantic Canada, would move to the US because the opportunitues and living standards were just better than what Canada had to offer. For a very long time, Canadians were worried about the risk of a massive brain drain.","With the exception of the technology industry, where many Canadian graduates move to San Francisco or Seattle to work for companies like Google or Amazon, that doesn’t happen as often now.","Our telecommunications giants in Canada are quite bad, but I hear that the American giants like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon are far worse.","You do get the feeling that the US is regressing in many ways. Poor quality infrastructure that is in a state of decay, a much weak social safety net, constant fear of illness, high rates of gun related fatalities, dysfunctional government, police forces that are excessively warlike, and for many, the declining state of living resemble a developing country.","I’m glad my family moved, but it seems like it is creeping northwards and into Europe as well.","Canadians believe government can actually function which many Americans don’t believe. As a result, many Americans work hard to disprove that government can actually function. This appears to be one of the best explanations of the current Congress.","Canada developed a social contract over the past 60 years where Canadians pay taxes and expect to get decent government functions, including universal health care. That struggled in the late 70s and 80s but seems to have rebounded over the past 20 years or so.","I live in a small city in upstate NY on the PA border. I’ve had Time Warner now Spectrum internet service for 6 years. It has only been out once for about 2 hours. I have two complaints.It is expensive. The other is they advertise 100 mbps starting speeds. When I test mine , the best I get is 37 mbps.","NY Times article on racism’s effect on Black boys is worth careful reading and thought. For me, it argues for major and long-term work to make neighborhoods healthier places to live, meaning places with good schools, access to capital to finance local businesses and community institutions, amenities, safety. In other words, places where kids thrive.","Two notes about FIOS service that probably apply, even though I live in Maryland. YOU are responsible for replacing the backup battery in the unit, and in my experience, they need replacement more often and don’t power the unit as long as the Verizon states. OTOH, I was surprised to discover that my FIOS box works with my old, dial telephone.","My problem is with the local power company, Southern California Edison. In the last three months or so, they have had scheduled power outage three times already. No idea what they are doing, but that seems a little too often.","Edison scheduled an all-day outage here a few weeks back. It was on a Monday from 8AM to 4PM. As I work from home, I pushed projects back and planned on spending the day reading a book.\n8AM came, no outage. Visited the Socaled website, no explanation. The power stayed on all day.","My WAG is that they are performing much deferred distribution system upgrades to make up for under investment over the last decade and deal with a truly difficult to manage surge in rooftop PV (which at higher penetrations such as what CA is beginning to see can introduce all sorts of difficulties).","Although I would guess PG&E might be in worse shape than SCE in terms of deferred capital investment because of their early 00s bankruptcy.","You can do a search of reviews just for your zipcode. If you click on a review you’ll see a scale to the right which also includes a scale on connection reliability.","See http://www.dslreports.com/reviews. Enter your zipcode and then just click on the first “go” button, after the “Tech” dropdown – you don’t even need to select anything in that dropdown unless you want to filter the results even more. The results are limited to recent reviews; so you’re not getting reviews that go far back in time.","I switched from Verizon DSL to Spectrum in 2015: I’ve only experienced one lengthy outage (according to news reports the problem was with a network backbone provider, not Spectrum). Once in a while during the wee hours there will be a five minute service interruption (presumably scheduled maintenance).","So far I haven’t had an issue that required tech support or service (I probably soon will now that I’ve said that). My only complaint is that Spectrum’s e-mail servers are always painfully slow (one reason I use a separate e-mail provider).","Back in the days I was with Verizon their FIOS telemarketers phoned weekly (once when I called for DSL tech support I was “accidentally” routed to a FIOS salesman). They only stopped dunning me after I told them that if I heard from FIOS again I would bundle my telephone and internet business with my cable TV company.","About three years later I received a letter from Verizon saying they would soon discontinue their copper wire service and gave me a deadline to adopt FIOS to avoid an interruption in service. The N.Y. State Public Commission told me that “yes, they can do that.” That’s when I made the move to TWC/Spectrum and I haven’t looked back.","Another thing about FIOS: If your router/modem dies, don’t expect any help from Verizon. Oh, they’ll try to sell you a new one for $150. But you can buy the same unit for around $100 on Amazon.","This is a summary of what I experienced while visiting Mom over the holidays. Ran all over hell’s half acre trying to find her a replacement unit. I finally went to the Big Evil River and ordered one. It arrived two days later, I plugged it in, and the thing worked like a charm.","Amr Moussa, Secretary-General of the Arab League before the criminal invasion of Iraq: ‘It will open the gates of hell!’ At that time I found the formulation rather bizzare, theatrical, at the least. Now it seems measured understatement.","Agree with Mr. Moussa. I felt similary at the time, despite BushCo jubilantly informing us hapless rubes that the Iraqi’s would greet Team USA! USA! USA! with rose petal parades (I truly think they said something along these lines). Yeah, NO!","What a clusterfeck. And how many *millions* marched around the globe against this senseless, greedy, grifting War Crime invasion based on lies, Lies, LIES? And whaddid we get? Over a million dead, and I’m STILL waiting for my Iraqi War Inc Oil “dividend” that W so gleefully “promised” us… with his fingers crossed behind his ratbag back.","Pallets of Yankee Dollar$$ shipped “over there” … and who knows what happened with that money? Torture happened, and now we get one of the Chief Torturers as the head of one branch of BigSpook, Inc. Yay, Yay, USA. puke","Your tax dollar$ at work. Please don’t bother to “Learn” me about how MY taxes don’t pay for War, Inc. Whatever… they do in some ways.","Against an impressive amount of warnings, from a wide variety of sources, including the intelligence community, as to the complexity of the Iraqi situation and the high risks involved in letting loose, imprudently, the long-compressed popular dynamics in that country, the Bush administration chose to listen only to a very specific set of “experts”: the Pentagon’s friends among the Iraqi opposition in exile. The most symptomatic of them in my view is Kanan Makiya-a man who has much been quoted as part of a neocon cabal led by former “Trotskyites” that took the helm of U.S. foreign policy, according to a somewhat phantasmagoric view propagated by both liberal and conservative circles.","Makiya was recruited at Brandeis University after becoming the anti-Saddam Hussein intellectual par excellence for the media, which-after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990-upgraded to the best-seller list his Republic of Fear, a labored description of Baathist Iraq inspired by both Arthur Koestler and George Orwell. He turned from Trotskyism and friendship with people like Tariq Ali (and myself) into becoming the house intellectual of Ahmad Chalabi, the famous Iraqi crook and Donald Rumsfeld’s buddy.","The quote:","And when asked if he agreed with the statement made the day before by Vice President Cheney that American forces will be “greeted as liberators” in Iraq, Makiya replied: “I most certainly do agree with that. As I told the President on January 10th, I think they will be greeted with sweets and flowers in the first months and simply have very, very little doubt that that is the case.”","And how could he disagree with Cheney? The latter himself had given Makiya’s expertise as his key reference in making his prognosis. That was on NBC’s program “Meet the Press.” When Tim Russert, the interviewer, insisted, asking what “if your analysis is not correct, and we’re not treated as liberators, but as conquerors,” Cheney replied:","“Well, I don’t think it’s likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe that we will be greeted as liberators. I’ve talked with a lot of Iraqis in the last several months myself, had them to the White House. The president and I have met with them, various groups and individuals, people who have devoted their lives from the outside to trying to change things inside Iraq. And like Kanan Makiya who’s a professor at Brandeis, but an Iraqi, he’s written great books about the subject, knows the country intimately, and is a part of the democratic opposition and resistance. The read we get on the people of Iraq is there is no question but what they want is to get rid of Saddam Hussein and they will welcome as liberators the United States when we come to do that.”","“Sweets and flowers” then went viral and became a catchphrase symbolizing the absurd pretensions of the Iraq invasion.","* * *","Those of us who remember the run-up to the Iraq war — it happened when I was just starting out as a blogger, and gave impetus to what we then called “the blogosphere” — can’t help but be struck by the similarities between that engineered war scare and this one (including the role of the compliant press and the British intelligence agencies, as well as the unanimous approval of war by elites*). The differences are:","1) Bush tried to present and plant actual “evidence” (even if it was shot down) like the yellowcake uranium, the aluminum tubes, and all the rest of it. Today’s effort simply relies on unverified and unverifiable leaks from the intelligence community (along with viral videos).","2) It was clear for a solid year before the shots were fired that Bush was going to war regardless, because there was a massive effort to pre-position the materiel. I don’t see that prepositioning going on now, suggesting that the current crop of warmongers doesn’t want boots on the ground**, but that means drones and air strikes (i.e., not holding ground). How does that work?","3) That the elites want a war, any war, is confirmed by the constant shifts in which foreign power the 5 Minutes of Hate is targeted at. Russia? North Korea? Iran? It doesn’t matter, so long as we get a war with one of them! The Bush administration targeted only Iraq, from the beginning.","4) The United States, as a result of Iraq, may be stronger militarily, but is visibly weaker in every other way (and we haven’t won any wars at all since 1945, have we?)","* Most of whom were not held accountable in any way and are still in power (including the torturers). They consider themselves immune, so why wouldn’t they start another war?","** And where would they get them? I’m convinced, FWIW, that the flyover states are tired of this crap, and that’s where the troops come from. Crossed fingers that Sanders is edging toward making an anti-militaristic case to them in terms they can accept, and that his Yemen bill — shot down by Democrats, naturally, since 5 Republicans crossed the aisle to support it — is an opening move.","It’s past time to push the political window in the correct direction. (The political science term for the “window” of acceptable discourse has slipped my mind.) For the invasion of Iraq, this entails creatively imagineering appropriate punishments of the kingpins for aggressive war.","Germany and Japan had the daylights bombed out of them during the final months of WWII. We really don’t want our metropolitan areas to suffer the same fate. So we probably want more than the ordinary execution that followed the Nuremberg Tribunals. Crucifixion would be ideal if not for the religious symbolism and imagery. But then there’s the rack. And one can web-search other interesting, fetishistic execution methods from Renaissance history.","The cost of the war will be paid in blood and guts, not money.","Just remember: “War is Hell”. Think of the 12yo son blown up in an aerial bombing, or the 10yo daughter’s left arm and leg blown off.","I’ve thought a lot about this, and while I think it’s a useful metaphor, the Overton Window is only two-dimensional. I think political conflict takes place on a plane (a terrain) and not a line (binary thinking). A lot of our stressors come from the effort of forcing multiple dimensions into two.","Its all quite curiously low key. I can find very little real detail in the news today, but it seems that the negotiators are quite confident that a deal is almost done on a transition period. The UK has conceded on pretty much every key element so far as I can see. But even the Brexit hardliners seem to be only putting up token resistance. Are they saving up their ammo for later? The DUP have been surprisingly quiet too, are they still trying to take in the implications? I wonder if the hardliners have been persuaded that if they agree to this, then their nirvana has only been delayed by 21 months.","I posted a link to the text yesterday, and there was some reasonable quick commentary from experts on the Grauniad and Independent sites. The general consensus was that the UK had given way on almost everything, which seems to be the case from the amount of green in the text.\nRichard North has a typically cogent analysis this morning, and I think he’s right about the unreality of the whole situation. The muted reactions in the media seem to be a product on the one hand of shock, on the other of an inability to comprehend where we have got to under this government, and on the third, a sense of relief that immediate disaster has been averted, even if the Northern Ireland question remains unsettled, and could sink the whole thing.\nI think what happened is that the EU put a gun to the government’s head, and said, if you accept basically everything else now, we’ll give you more time to find a political fix for the NI question. May accepted, because it’s a stay of execution and more months, perhaps a year, in power. She’ll sell various communities in NI and Scotland out to do that, without a second thought.","I’ll need to reread it several times to make sure I’ve not missed anything but there seems to have been sufficient dollops of eurofudge to keep everyone happy for a couple of years and thereafter in a semipermanent state of muddling through:","Article 13","Safeguards","1. If the application of this Protocol leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties liable to persist, the Union or the United Kingdom may unilaterally take appropriate measures. Such safeguard measures shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Protocol.","2. If a safeguard measure taken by the Union or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, in accordance with paragraph 1 creates an imbalance between the rights and obligations under this Protocol, the Union or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may take such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Protocol.","Article 15","Subsequent agreement","Should a subsequent agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom which addresses the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, avoids a hard border and protects the 1998 Agreement in all its dimensions, become applicable after the entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement, this Protocol shall not apply or shall cease to apply, as the case may be, in whole or in part, from the date of application of such subsequent agreement and in accordance with that agreement.","“measures as will least disturb the functioning of this protocol”? What is it, Sleeping Beauty or something?","And don’t get get me started on the whole of that Article 15. I can’t believe they kept straight faces when they issued that doozie. They were channelling Humpty Dumpty with that one:","When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.” “The question is,” said Alice, “whether you can make words mean so many different things?”","I suppose the big question is why? The UK has lots of motivation to fudge like crazy, but the EU doesn’t. I can only assume they’ve decided that the extra time is in everyones short to medium term interest.","I agree. It didn’t actually hurt the EU anymuch to make the whole Brexit situation more loosely coupled. They’ve kicked a few cans you could easily stub your toe on quite nastily down the road in the case of a hard Brexit (properly checking imports at major hubs like Europoort Rotterdam and — and I’ll call confess I didn’t appreciate the importance of this one — a sudden cliff edge stop for fishing rights) and got the U.K. to pick up the cans it certainly didn’t want left lying around (current EU budget round payments and future U.K. obligations to the EIB and pension liabilities).","And it acknowledges that the end of 2020 is a long way away, politically. Theresa May will probably be gone, Arlene Foster might not be around so the DUP could wise up (finally…), there might have been a snap UK election, the Commission has got itself into an uncharacteristic tight spot with the bungled Japanese corporate non-governance governance style Ascension to Heaven of Martin Selmayr (which does strongly suggest it has got itself spread too thinly to keep everything on an even keel all at once, especially with big time stealers like Brexit to deal with) and political instability in Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain needing to be handled.","Putting Brexit to bed for a year or so just seems in everyone’s interests right now. And as Brexit is simply not going to go away, this Draft Withdrawal Agreement seems to not displease anyone to a sufficient degree that it’s mostly liveable-with. And the U.K. government also seems to have finally woken up to the fact that it’s about the best they can expect to get.","I think, with regard to your last line, is that while the senior negotiators have woken up to the fact that this is the best they can get, they seem to have done precisely zero to ease the way to a climbdown (unless the relative quietness of the hard Brexiters means that they’ve been quietly lobbied and agreed that there will be another time and place for a battle over this).","I assume we’ll know when May faces Parliament next – either the Tories will do a big show of solidarity in the face of the Russian hordes, or there will be blood on the carpet.","All my other posts today have disappeared into moderation. Perhaps this one will make it through. I think the answer is that the EU wants the most graceful Brexit possible to limit the damage and inconvenience to its members. By accepting so much of the EU draft text, the UK government has effectively committed itself, but also any conceivable future government after an election, to a series of things the EU wants, and been obliged to give up a number of things they were not prepared to accept. You can’t row back from that kind of agreement, even if, technically, nothing is agreed until everything is. If there is a final agreed text, we now have a good idea what it will look like. The NI concession as I have said in another comment earlier, is essentially meaningless. It simply gives more time for realignment of political forces before something like the EU draft text is accepted by the UK.","I think it could be, in the sense that Brexit was always primarily a political concept, very vaguely defined, rather than a thought-through economic and political strategy with identified benefits. BINO could actually be sold on this basis, in the sense that, once the UK is out of the EU, the essential political objective will have been met, irrespective of the practical consequences. And I think the rather downbeat reaction to the government’s total surrender this week can only make BINO as an option more likely – all smoke and mirrors in the end, perhaps.","They can’t do BINO. The EU has been very clear that any “future relationship” has to fit within existing parameters. The UK’s red lines mean a Canada type deal, and even if they relax them, the best they get is Norway. That is NOT BINO.","And if they were to rejoin, they have to accept the Euro. Those are the current rules.","You and I know that. I was making a different point, that there is constituency which will be satisfied if the UK is “out” of Europe. They are quite numerous and pay little attention to the detail of negotiations. They are focused on leaving Europe, not on the future relationship, which is a different issue. In other words, it is theoretically feasible for May’s government to claim victory, independently of the content of the withdrawal agreement, on the basis that the UK is now “out” of Europe.","The EU’s actions imply that they think they have a lot to lose. I saw one example, which I can’t remember right now. The German automakers might be a factor. And the EU citizens living in the UK are hostages of a sort, especially the ones from places like Poland that aren’t eager to get them back suddenly.","But all of that is just speculation. I think analysis of what the EU has to lose has been lacking here, because Yves doesn’t think there’s that much. I’d have to take her word for it, but the EU itself doesn’t. I keep remembering that Britain is one of the Big 5 economies, although not in the Euro. What’s missing from this picture? Is the EU just turning out to be a big softy? Hoping Brexit will be reversed (which I still think likely)?","Huh? The UK capitulated on everything that mattered. And we’ve written repeatedly that the German automakers are firmly behind Merkel. The UK press has acted as if the German automakers would rise up and they haven’t. You have to stop believing what you read there.","Every European newspaper I read said the UK had caved on all of its red lines. True as that may be, getting the EU to kick the Irish border can of worms further down the road (until the DUP can be soothed or tossed overboard) seems a slight victory for May, but more important was the EU letting the UK negotiate treaties prior to Brexit, which could be a huge opening for the government, if they can get their ducks in a row.","May’s job will now be quelling dissent from Brexiteers as the reality sinks in. Rees-Mogg called the agreement unsatisfactory but acceptable, while Farage called for the PM to step down.","Yes, that seems the consensus, but the response has been unexpected low key – I think reflecting a lot of puzzlement with what this actually means in reality. I think the big question is whether the government can sell this to the wider Tory party.","If there was only some way to distract the populace while all of this was going on. Something that will have all the TV, radio and newspapers all fired up and unified as a nation. Something outrageous that could be turned into a three-ring circus, preferably involving lots of military and their toys but without all the costly messiness of an actual war. Something that would take all the oxygen of the Brexit negotiations/cave-ins.\nNope, too much for me. Guess I need to have a brain the size of a planet to come up with something like that.","The Verizon cord cutting – sorry to hear. T-Mobile has a plan for unlimited hotspot data plan for their smartphones. “hotspot” creates a wifi you can access with any computer. I think they call it the “international” plan and its a $30 add-on. Totally worth it.","Yves I know you hate smartphones but the hotspot data feature is alot faster than DSL. I have the same privacy issues with smartphones as you do if not worse. Get a used samsung version 7 and use it for hotspot and calls only. I dont even have a google acct active on mine, and the location tracking is turned off.","One could just as well or better pick up a USB LTE modem aka “air card” for one’s laptop on the order of $30 and get an extra data SIM for it, which was only $10/mo atop my T-Mobile unlimited plan. Bonus: when it’s unplugged, you can be somewhat more sure it’s unplugged.","(Of course, if you buy a non-carrier-locked smartphone, hotspot/tethering features are built into recent Android releases and, if you use a VPN atop that, nobody will or can be the wiser.)","Yves, I think perhaps he meant you would leave the phone at home. As your internet connection.\nYou are already “located” at your address, by your copper connection. If the phone, or smartcard, stays there with your PC, what is the difference?","I don’t understand your point at all. Someone’s home address is known and has pretty much always been public (court records if you own your house, in phone directories unless you paid to be unlisted) even before the Internet. I publish my business phone and address various places.","It is a completely different matter to have your phone spying on where you go during the day, all day, with time stamps of where you have been, which is what geolocation does. If you leave your phone home, that does not happen. If you have a smartphone but leave it in a Faraday bag a lot, you cut down the completeness of the record a lot (provided you are not pulling out your phone every two nanoseconds). If you have a dumbphone, they geolocation is less accurate (only to within 100 feet) plus unless you become a target and the authorities get a warrant and track you all the time, your phone company retains data only on when you’ve used the phone, so they can retrospectively locate you only when you were calling or getting/sending texts. And if you have a dumpphone, taking the battery out also stops geolocation.","I set up an account (I think, not sure if I finished it) there years ago. May actually have visited once, but ever since, I have been receiving emails from them, even though I haven’t been there for a long time. I don’t even remember my password. So, I am not sure how to delete that account. I would think my account should be inactive, and they would let me alone. Do I have to do something to delete my account?","Yes, you absolutely MUST DO something to delete your account, and my understanding is that it is a deliberately complicated process (I don’t know for sure, as I never ever created an account there).","There is a way to recover your password (or create a new one), I’m sure. I don’t know how Faceborg does it, but usually there’s a place where you can click on something saying “I forgot my password,” and you enter your email address. They’ll send you a link by email to recreate a new password, so that you can get to your account… in order to delete it.","Good luck!! Others who have accounts are likely to be more knowledgeable than me and can chime in with useful pointers.","I have deleted my FB account twice in the past three-four years, carefully following the directions both times. However, certain sites will still trigger a request to “log in via Facebook” complete with a view of my page, so I have to conclude that it is still there. Hmmm.","I’ve had a facebook account for some time to keep in touch with people who are scattered all over the world, including cousins in the U.S. I haven’t been able to figure out why it’s such a big deal, but I’m an old, so even though I’ve been dealing with computers since 1976 I’m pretty socially inept and probably don’t “get” social networking. I can imagine one of my cousins, a very smart woman with a PhD in Economics, persuading me to change my mind about some point, but I can’t imagine some ugly meme/photo/graphic affecting me in any way but offending. I have a wide assortment of sources which I have assigned appropriate levels of trust on certain topics. I regard almost every announcement by a government official as a lie, also almost all stories in the New York Times and the Washington Post, especially if their sources are “requesting anonymity” for any reason. I happen to think that advertising is generally pretty ineffective, but the advertising agencies have sold themselves as essential to every business. All these “powerful” people are just members of a small in-group doing favors for each other. They provide no value to society, and since Raygun have actually been actively harming society.","Another update from the Slim Gives Up Facebook for Lent file: I’m finding that I’m building genuine friendships with people who were acquaintances before March 6. (That was my first full day away from the Borg.)","Lent ends on April 1, and the Tucson NC meetup is on April 6. Come to that meetup and I’ll give you a personal update on how the Facebook Fast is going. At this point, I’m planning to keep it going. Because I am having too much fun!","People are slowly waking to the fact that their personal data is not worth nothing and can be used against them. Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, all your phone apps – they should pay you a royalty every time they sell your data (which is often), or at least allow you the option not to release your data. Or better, stop disgorging your life into corporate databases.","There is a growing movement designed to persuade people to abandon Facebook and Twitter, playing heavily on privacy concerns and the implication that intelligent people will do it. The problem, as Caity Johnstone and I agree, is that most of the people who need to hear from alternative news sources and commentators aren’t going to switch to some obscure geeky social media option in sufficient numbers to make those alternatives viable for our purposes.","Given the constant focus in the corporate media is how stupid people are on the major social media networks because they’re always being persuaded to this and that by Russian trolls, it’s no surprise to me that people who avoid, say, Facebook are totally ignorant of the fact there is a very vibrant community of people who aren’t Clinton cultists with severe cases of Trump derangement syndrome who are working daily to ensure others are aware of alternative narratives. If the people who are most likely to be encouraged to pause and think by those narratives are instead driven off, the narratives have been very effectively muzzled.","And the establishment knows it. I’ve said before I do not believe the sudden emergence of social media founders and executives urging people to give up what they founded is an accident. And yes, I have a large roll of aluminum foil handy, but the more I learn the more it becomes clear to me that throwing “conspiracy theorist” at anyone who has qualms about what seems to be a sudden sharp focus on scaring people away from something that can be very useful to rebellion.","I doubt that is the case with FaceBook or Twitter, given that all the data collected either already is or wil go to those who want to suppress any rebellion. See Yasha Levine’s Surveillance Valley; the Internet was designed to do just that. Leaving security features out of the basic architecture was not an accident.","Dear Yves,\nI live in Forest Hills, and have Spectrum outages every three months or so. Usually for a day at a time, sometimes shorter, sometimes longer. But regularly\nI’m told that Time Warner has brought in cheaper labor from outside New York (California often is cited) and workers are sabotaging it.\nThere’s no FIOS out here. My copper land line always works.","Time Warner victim, er, customer here. As a coping mechanism, I reboot my system periodically. Our local environment seems to slow down on schedule so that by Thursday that reboot becomes a necessity.","Separately, I recommend that everyone continue to be aware of any potential browser updates. These past several days have seen a flurry of activity as companies attempt to address ongoing security and other matters, somewhat beyond the old Patch Tuesdays. The usual caveats apply regarding whether to update and after which version so that you aren’t too much part of an unannounced beta test. Also consider some browser refresh or default restoration options based on your specific user needs.","1800 Spectrum technicians represented by IBEW Local 3 have been out on strike for nearly a year over union security and healthcare issues.

Just something you never gave any thought to, in terms of what it could do.","That said, we’re in a very earthquake safe part of California, where the largest one historically that I could find hitting here was a 4.1, which is the equivalent of a carnival ride, no biggie.","I live in one of the first areas that ATT installed with DSL in 1998 (IIRC). Every few years the wires get corroded and the service gets intermittent, but other than that it’s been great, if you think 3 MB/second for $30/month is a deal (we don’t stream TV). I’ve heard from neighbors that our wires won’t be replaced with fiber, that we’re going directly to 5G. Goodbye cheap internet.","I have spectrum in queens ny. Internet only package though they are constantly tring to upsell tv stations.","We have not had many service outages that we’re not power outages.

I don’t often have outages, but I find that I do have to reboot my modem fairly often….sometimes every week. I do have Fios in my building, but when I once called to get pricing…they asked me for my social security number….which I thought was pretty outrageous.","I’ve actually been emailing Yves about NYC Mesh (free community owned network once you buy the equipment).

I’ve seen small businesses and their owners have fines, liens and even jail time for similar activities.","“I suspect preliminarily it appears that the Uber would likely not be at fault in this accident …” Moir said.","Police also noted that the victim was probably homeless and was also jaywalking.","The police haven’t released the video yet, although “From viewing the videos, it’s very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway,” Moir said.","It very well may be that the video shows that this was an unavoidable accident. But the article hints that the video might have been taken by the robot car itself.

Of course that’s not always possible and especially for pedestrians, but the reality is that car drivers are looking out for other cars, not the rarely encountered cyclist or pedestrian. Humans see what they are expecting to see and therefore may have their own “Lidar problem.”","Robots will never be better than highly trained, attentive and skilled professional drivers. Electronics are not that reliable in my experience, may not get proper maintenance and will become more unreliable in the years ahead. We are entering a magnetic polar reversal on this planet. That means chaotic magnetic field strength for scores of years into the future. Radiation from our sun does a number on electronic equipment, I’ve experienced it several times. I once bought a new truck and in a month it came to a full stop on a busy two lane road because of a failed engine sensor in a solar storm.

While not quite good enough for hi-def video streaming, it’s sufficient for most web-related functions. Since it’s cellular, it’s best to set the modem by a window for best reception.","I also use it travelling, it’s much more secure (and sometimes faster) than connecting a laptop to public or hotel/institutional hotspots.","Most smart phones can be configured to operate as such a hotspot, but it’s a dedicated function (can’t make/receive calls), and usually requires an additional monthly plan. The Caylix modem service is comparably priced but more flexible to use, and has no cap, so no extra charges for exceeding 30Gb in a month.","Thanks but the Sprint network does not work in my apartment. I tried Karma, which runs over the Sprint network. No signal in my apartment. I contact Karma to complain and they say, basically, “Well, our coverage map says it ought to work.”","And this was not a device issue. Worked fine at Laguardia, the Dallas and Atlanta airports, and on planes in even more airports (when seated before takeoff).","Lambert’s theory is that my building (the first elevator apt. building in NYC) was overbuilt and has so much steel in it that it is partway to being a Faraday cage. Most of the apartment is a dead zone on my 2G phone too.","All those tin ceilings are terrible for sending/receiving radio waves. At a B&B in New Brunswick a few years ago I could watch the wifi signal strength on my laptop drop from stout to nothing as I descended the stairs from the lobby at the exact moment when I passed by the tin barrier. Under the lobby was the bar. Luckily, the proprietor was a member of the New Brunswick Scotch Appreciation Society (or some such name) and I soon quit worrying about the interwebs.","I was on a backpack trip with a couple of friends 15 years ago, when Shock & Awe® rained down upon Iraq, and after the initial skirmishes with boots on the ground went well, it all fell apart quickly.","Here on the home front, the housing bubble was accelerating across the country, and by the time the dark days of Fallujah meant that we had to destroy the city in order to save it, the bubble was fully engulfed.","Were the 2 episodes interrelated, something gained to pay for the loss of innocents?","I thought the Housing Bubble was cooked up as a response to the DotCom collapse. Once, the first was out, they just kept going. Shrub wasn’t exactly popular having just stolen an election. He pushed for a major tax cut, and Greenspan was slashing the Fed rate throughout the year. Yes, he was a new President, but 43 tried to hit the ground running. My sense is many Republicans really believe Gore and company really were “tax and spend” Democrats instead of more polite GOP types.","Its overlooked these days, but Bob Woodward revealed Rumsfeld wanted videos of targets for CNN knowing the 2004 election was around the corner. Keeping power was a major issue for the GOP.","Imagine if the leading figures of the #Resistance were a fraction of upset at Bush V Gore as they are at the Hillary campaign not understanding the electoral college.","Listening to Rep Jim Jordan – R-Ohio on NPR this morning complaining about the extraordinary length of the Mueller investigation “a year already”. aren’t these the same people who supported Ken Starr spending four years investigating the Clintons in the ’90s and four years investigating Benghazi from 2012 to 2106? Mueller has already come up with more indictments and guilty pleas than those 8 years of investigations produced.","Facebook seems to have offered various levels of data dissemination with various terms over time – as far as I understand it, these were tightened to a significant degree somewhere in the 2012-2014 period – I had access to secondary services based on facebook (instagram, twitter, etc) in 2014-15 that appeared to have fairly deep access (up-to the ability to run facial recognition based on tagged images in their various databases)","Most the services had pretty weak semi ‘AI’ analytics operating on these data sets. I assume these have improved since (at the time I was amazed by how bad the analytics performed generally, although there were some rare and somewhat scary exceptions)","I didn’t play with Cambridge Analytica, so can’t comment on their capabilities, but did play with some others that were impressive enough to indicate that CAs claims may be less oversold than some imagine","I have jury duty today, and as usual I am hoping to get on an interesting case, hopefully along the lines of somebody using a previously canceled stamp on a letter (a federal offense) or something similarly galling.","NeoFeudalism….a great way to keep the troublemakers from traveling to the cities as do tens of millions of Chinese workers.","See the “Last Train Home” video on Youtube about the yearly trip back from the factory dormitories to the home villages.

The other possibility might be a scarlet macaw. Wish I could see the other side of the bird and had some idea as to size. But based on this view and those red lines, I’d go with your call.","For years now, i’ve been watching Lake Mead recede from it’s shores, there are boat launching ramps 1/2 a mile from the water in some places. Combine that with Phoenix’s thirst, and it’s a given that the city they cemented over, will be the 1st big American city to go tilt, in my opinion.","Foreign observers can have somewhat fanciful notions about the American west. When Piers Taylor of the Netflix series The World’s Most Extraordinary Homes visited a custom house outside Tucson, he made the offhand comment that it never rains in the desert, so the roof doesn’t have to be designed for it.","Probably he was there in June, the driest month of the year, not realizing that monsoon rains make August the wettest month (with the corresponding potential for rainwater collection and storage).","I have a relative in Bullhead City, AZ. Another HOT spot. His take is that “official” temeratures always are lower than the highs shown by temp monitoring equipment in the private domain.\nI have been on his shaded patio, when the temps were easily 10deg F. greater than what the NOAA sensors at the airport were broadcasting.(Averraging several thermo measuring devices).\nPerhaps the PTB has an interest in not scaring off the snowbirds. Yeah, I’m a little foily…","Jim – Do you live in Phoenix? Just wondering if it is your position that Phoenix (and other large cities in AZ: e.g. Tucson) does actually have a future? In other words, are you long Phoenix? I visit in-laws in Phoenix a couple of times per year, so just curious.","Downtown Phoenix is 1100 ft and sits in a bowl surrounded by mountains which aggravates the smog problem.

As if “Russia stole the election!” was getting stale, so a new excuse was needed in order to avoid any introspection for Democrats. Now, “Cambridge Analytica stole the election!”","Is there really any meat to this story? Even if we don’t dispute that yes, Facebook user data was used by the Trump campaign – would it have actually made any discernible difference in the election? Or a difference more important than, say, Clinton being a terrible candidate, or voter’s dissatisfaction with decades of neoliberalism?","So, when will Democratic elites begin to ask: what is the connection between Cambridge Analytica and the British government?","I doubt our “special ally” will be subjected to the same intense scrutiny as Russia has. This, despite the fact that Australian, hence British subject, Rupert Murdoch has done inestimably more damage to USA democracy the past four decades than anything Putin and Russia have done.","Remember, Britain is a monarchy. Hence, government of, by, and for oligarchs, or “high net worth individuals.” Is it really coincidence that USA has ceased being a republican democracy and become an oligarchy controlled by “high net worth individuals”?","“Cambridge Analytica was founded by conservatives Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.” — Wikipedia","It is headed by a British former financial analyst and all-round dodgy geezer. He did go to Eton so will know a lot of top Tories.","“In 1981, Murdoch bought The Times, his first British broadsheet, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen (and as a result, gave up Australian citizenship) in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership.” — Wikipedia","You are right about the damage he has done, in the UK and Australia not just the US. You are a bit confused about the British and Australian political setup.","The Sarkozy story is an important development. The former President is being held in “garde-à-vue” – ie in custody, probably for 48 hours. At the end of that time the police should either recommend that the magistrates bring charges or let him go. Of interest, Brice Hortefeux, Sarkozy’s longtime fixer and bagman, is also being interviewed as a “suspect libre”, ie he has been asked to attend for questioning as a suspect, but can’t be forced to stay in custody. Other members of Sarkozy’s clique are also in serious legal trouble, including Claude Guéant, who was his Interior Minister.\nWhen the first allegations of Libyan financing of Sarkozy’s election campaign in 2007 appeared, they tended to be dismissed as conspiracy theorizing. But both the police and the media, from their different perspectives, have been turning over stones patiently, and more and more evidence is emerging, notably from documents seized by the police. Watch the news over the next day or so to see whether Sarkozy is charged. If so, it will not just be the first French President sent for trial (he’s already been charged with lesser, unrelated offenses) , it will be a major question-mark over the 2007 election, and of course over the 2011 bombing of Libya, and why that happened.","On Facebook and Cambridge Analytica let’s not fall into the trap that this was a Trump show exclusively. In fact Carol Davidsen who was the former head of the Obama 2012 analytics efforts just revealed yesterday in a series of tweets that they extracted by devious means the complete social graph of the US population from Facebook databases and as she says:","“Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.”","I doubt that Obama did not share the (updated?) social graph data with Hillary so what I don’t understand is the 2016 unsuccessful(?) effort by the Hillary campaign to get the Bernie mailing list even though Hillary had Google and Facebook in her back pocket (remember Eric Schmidt at the Hillary ‘Victory’ party in NYC).","I was also thinking that one thing that is under the radar is the USPS database since for years now all mail covers are scanned so the Bernie mailing list can be reverse engineered from their database. Actually the USPS has recently taken advantage of the ‘service’ to make it available to residents who are absent and need to be notified by email of regular mail being delivered to their registered address. I use the service myself since I am away from home for long periods and need to know if something unexpected shows up. There are probably laws that prevent its use in that way but who knows…","A couple of disquieting parallels to the Internet Bubble which ended 18 years ago:","1. At 75%, the portion of IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) with negative earnings is at the highest level since 1999. One is reminded of a 1999 commercial in which two tech bros are talking stocks. “I was gonna take a flyer on Jetson Datatech, but it’s got earnings.” “Dude … bummer!”","2. On Jan 14, 2000 — in the same month Robert Shiller’s Irrational Exuberance was published — the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its cyclical peak of 11,723. A couple of months later, the poster child of the Internet Bubble, the high-flying Nasdaq Composite which contained many of those no-earnings IPOs, reached its final Bubble I summit of 5,048.","In an echo of that pattern, this year the Dow’s last record high of 26,617 was reached on Jan 26th. Last week on March 12th, the Nasdaq rose to a record high of 7,588, three percent above its March 2000 high water mark after inflation adjustment.","Ideally, a strong bull market exhibits across the board strength in all sizes and sectors of stocks. When strength in one index is not confirmed by another, it suggests narrow, fluctuating leadership and diminishing momentum.","Now a lethal cocktail of reckless fiscal policy, a pending trade war, and a potential Watergate-replay constitutional crisis may finally have inserted the decisive poisoned banderilla into the neck of our beloved Bubble III, which is all that keeps America’s decaying Potemkin economy in the semblance of a recovery.","Being a geezer from The Horizon, I worry that this Bubble Popping Ceremony will mimic what happened after the 1929 market breaks. We already have a cheap reproduction Herbert Hoover at the helm of the Ship of State. I can almost write in my head the press releases announcing cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and federal matching funds for everything not MIC related in order to “keep the budget balanced in these hard times.”\nOur esteemed Fed picadors will have laughingly noticed that many of the vicariously valued viewers of this machismo sport were struck by the deflationary darts.\nWe paid to see this show! Who do we importune to get our money back? Some suspect that the ‘money’ was never ‘there’ to begin with.\nFrom where I sit, near the bottom of the cheap seats, this Potemkin Village is in just a ‘shamblance’ of a recovery.\nBring on the Bears!","Re internet connection — I had FIOS for about a year in NYC and vaguely recall an outage or two but more significantly I found the connection to be subject to frequent hiccups that would interrupt streaming (even of audio-only sources). It was irritating enough that I switched to Spectrum which has not had such problems. By the way, the FIOS box, which was in the apartment when I moved in, is quite a large eyesore growing out of the wall. Your experience with DSL sounds better than mine during a stint in the upstate wilds; I was close to the phone company office but the connection was still unreliable.","RE: the SacBee article re CalPers retirees being worried about their pensions, one of the commenters to the artilcle links to yesterday’s NC article (also linked above) about the perfidious behavior of the CalPers Board turning off new Board Member, Margaret Brown’s mic and refusing to provide her with past info.","Couldn’t happen to a nicer bloke. Sarkozy was right at the forefront of leading France into the destruction of Libya and he should be in a slammer at the Hague. Still, people like this are never brought to account for their war crimes so if he is in deep doo-doo, it must be for other reasons. Maybe Macron wants to remove him as a political threat down the track? Time will tell as stuff like this comes out eventually.","I had forgotten he was President of France then. What I remember is when he was leaving the IMF and was in New York for some reason, he was accused of raping a maid at his hotel. There was some confusion in her story and she had an unsavory boyfriend, and of course he’s rich, so the prosecutor decided to drop the case, but Sarkozy made a number of arrogant statements that convinced me he was guilty, and several stories emerged that suggested he had almost certainly done the same think in several other hotels around the world. I must say I’m enjoying the schadenfreude.","Funny that all this is coming up for you just at this moment, Yves. I had Time-Warner cable for about 10 years at my old apartment in Jackson Heights, Queens. They would have occasional service outages, mostly related to the wires out on the street, which were highly prone to storm damage. But I found they were quite diligent with customer service and it was never a big problem. Until they were bought out by “Spectrum”, and then all went to hell.","Spectrum forced me to “upgrade” the modem we leased from them (they said it was out of date), and from then on connectivity was a constant on-off, worked-okay-until-it-didn’t kind of thing. Quite literally, my connection was broken every 2 minutes, forcing me to open my network preferences and run the diagnostic cycle. Nine times out of ten, this resumed the connection, but it was seriously annoying. I assumed (silly me) that it was just the new modem, so I called them up and told them to send me a replacement, which they did. It worked no better than the so-called “upgrade”, which convinced me that Spectrum was, in fact, throttling my service since I was purchasing an internet-only package at the lowest rate.","When we moved to Forest Hills in the fall, the same problems continued. I was already turned off by Spectrum’s abuse of its labor force and its poor relationship with its labor unions, and we resolved to switch services. We finally ditched Spectrum about 3 weeks ago. On the “severance call”, I told them I was leaving because of the precipitous decline in service, their abhorrent customer service (every time you call you’re forced through a long series of automated responses, and then told that if you pay a bill with a live operator they’ll charge you an additional $4.95 or something), and because of the company’s mistreatment of its labor force. Spectrum, in turn, completely messed up our final billing (sending payments made on the new account to the old, and vice-versa), and despite cancelling our service back in February, they just sent us a *new* bill, with a past-due date for the previous month (which we had already paid). It took a 37-minute phone call last week straighten that out, and I won’t be convinced that all’s fixed until the actual final bill arrives.","As for Verizon and service outages: a week after we had FIOS installed, we lost service and reported it to the company…they sent a tech out and within 3 hours they had rectified the situation (they said it was a bad splice on the fiber cable outside our apartment). That was an inconvenience, but I felt they handled it well.","After the March 7 storm, FIOS was down again. The symptoms looked the same, but this time when I called, the earliest they could get a tech out to us was 48 hours later (the morning of Sunday the 11th). The appointment time came and went, we made several calls to Verizon (diverted to their answering service, which seems to be located in India) but could get no clear answer on what was happening. Finally, on one call the operator told us that the damage was on the street — due to the storm — and that a construction crew had been sent out to do repairs. These were finally effected around 8PM that day, and we got a text message telling us service had been restored.","Since then our service has been fine. Can’t say I’m happy with Verizon, and in particular the fact that if you call them for service outages on a weekend, you get sent to a call center thousands of miles and several time zones away. But we *had* to switch, as Spectrum had become intolerable, and in this new area we didn’t seem to have much other choice.","I wish New York City had good-quality municipal broadband. You would think there might be a market for such a product here.","This would make for the ultimate disaster film other than a meteor strike, ET alien invasion or full scale nuclear war.","Although this is only part one & covers only Portland, I imagine more substantial damage. Not only would an earthquake of this magnitude or greater severely impact buildings & infrastructure, but imagine that it sets off all of the Cascade volcanoes from Northern California to Northern Washington state. Now you have ash that prevents air traffic, including helicopter assistance with emergency relief. There may be pyroclastic mud flows driving Westward toward the large cities. A tsunami may be heading Eastward toward some of the big cities. Now you have pincer movement of mud flows from one side and a tsunami from the other side. Yikes !!","If you’re a fan of avoiding long-tail risks and live in earthquake country, no excuse to not have a simple disaster kit: first aid-tourniquet supplies, batteries, flashlight, water, a decent amount of gas in the car, etc.","If-when the big one comes, people likely be on their own for hours as the emergency services will be too busy dealing with fires and extricating people from collapsed masonry buildings.","Hours. Hah! After Katrina, our neighborhood was “on its’ own” for a week.\nIf this exercise in Disaster writing did its’ research right, expect ‘Gilligans’ Island’ conditions to last a half year or longer. They did on the Gulf Coast in 2005. That assumes a functioning economy in the rest of the nation however. When Cascadia goes, how much of the national infrastructure goes with it? If Seattle goes dark, how much of the Internet goes dark with it? Etc.","We have friends and family at the coast. The coast range highways are unstable in the best of times. I think that after a magnitude 9 and tsunami, the coast will be partly isolated INDEFINITELY. Aid will come only from the sea, and maybe the air. And not from the valley, anyway, which will be in the shape Rothstein describes.","Fortunately, Oregon has no large cities exposed to tsunamis, but a legion of smaller settlements. Friends of ours live just within the tsunami zone, and he’s too old to move quickly uphill. Newport, mentioned in the article, would be hit but most of it is elevated (the touristy waterfront would be wiped out, and the bridges would go down). Astoria is also hilly, but the waterfront would be flooded. Seaside is the worst: it’s cut off from higher ground by a river with only a few bridges across it. A tsunami would wash completely over it. I wouldn’t live there in any circumstances.","Give a thought to Port Angeles, on the north coast of the Olympic Peninsula, and Victoria, which is the provincial capital of British Columbia, if a magnitude-9 quake triggered a tsunami. Think of that sucker coming into the Straits of Juan de Fuca, which would narrow it and thus raise it. Port Angeles and Victoria are both at sea level.","My heart doesn’t bleed for Victoria since it, a provincial capital (!), is still dumping its raw sewage into the Straits last I heard.","Regarding the MOA story, click through to the Craig Murray site and read some of the stuff there. I can’t avoid the feeling this is a Tory effort aimed at Jeremy Corbyn. Russia is the new cannon aimed at the left.","Having switched from Spectrum to FIOS in Manhattan a few months ago – based on my experience, Spectrum has more down time and happens more often. When working normally, connection speed seems to be about the same. Navigating the TV is easier on Spectrum however.","I understand that Genghis Khan either allowed local tribal chiefs to ride and conquer with him or executed them based on their ability to solve a similar puzzle. They were given a stick and allowed to work the problem out in the dirt of a hut in which they were imprisoned.

It looks like that they are sitting on chairs set against the back of the place as shown by the mirror reflection on the right.

A big one is pharmaceutical fraud, by Big Pharma. A little tiny pharmacy that started out in Key West, providing infusion meds to people with HIV, discovered one such scam, and its owners got together with a local “bulldog” attorney to bring a “qui tam” lawsuit naming the company. Qui tam is an action by a citizen ‘on behalf or relation of” a government, essential to embarrass and thus force the government to take action for violations of law that said government should be investigating and enforcing through government mechanisms. Here’s a pop version of “How Four Men Got Rich Exposing Pharma Fraud,” https://www.cnbc.com/id/41491563. There is a lot more about Ven-a-Care if one cares to search on their name — they have recovered or catalyzed the recovery of billions in fraudulent claims for federal and state governments, and for what it’s worth, not much in our mindless age, have highlighted a lot of very bad behaviors.

Even though I have praised some aspects of the Chinese system (like the “iron rice bowl’ state sector jobs that have already declined in number) they are outweighed by the authoritarianism and conformity that seems to run through much of Chinese society. The Chinese experiment disproves “end of history” narratives that economic development will inevitably produce freedom and democracy.","The sad thing is that the United States already has something close to a de facto social credit system.

Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has admitted to mistakes, but his explanations have not satisfied the financial markets or mitigated the understandable indignation of millions of people after they learned that a British company named Cambridge Analytica used millions of profiles without consent to benefit the Donald Trump presidential campaign.","Privacy is comparable to other fundamental rights","Watching over user privacy and protecting their information is one of Facebook’s unavoidable duties, as it is in general for companies like Google, Amazon, YouTube and Twitter, whose powerful servers store vast amounts of personal information. That information is the pillar of their business model. Their algorithms process people’s online habits and later serve them with personalized ads. A perverse use of this stream of data can agitate street protests, manipulate public opinion on controversial subjects, and incite citizens to vote for a specific candidate, thereby attacking the essence of democracy.","The suspicions regarding Facebook’s ability to influence politics are serious, and if it really hopes to gain back user trust, the company should direct its efforts at dispelling those accusations. Facebook, which has designed firewalls against fake online news and established mechanisms to identify reliable outlets, also has a responsibility to increase its control over political advertising, even if this means losing a (minimal) amount of its advertising revenues.","It is undeniable that tech companies have helped build a more open, connected world","It is undeniable that tech companies have helped build a more open, connected world.

The US Administration, the British Parliament and the European Parliament are asking Zuckerberg for conclusive answers and efficient measures.

When users ask to permanently delete their accounts, the company suggests: “You may want to download a copy of your info from Facebook.” It is this data dump that reveals the extent of Facebook’s data harvesting – surprising even for a company known to gather huge quantities of personal information.","I had a similar issue with mine on Android.

Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife.","About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app “scraped” information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends’ profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica.","A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn’t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.","This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a “data breach.” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false.” He contended that Facebook users “knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” He also said that “everyone involved gave their consent.”","Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn’t a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook’s business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook’s users.","Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please.","Facebook doesn’t just record every click and “like” on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases “external” data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge “offline” data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases.","Facebook even creates “shadow profiles” of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States.","Despite Facebook’s claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her “consent” — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off.","This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.","Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person’s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook “likes” — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?","Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable.","What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.","The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company’s operations in the 2016 presidential election.","If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn’t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn’t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone’s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.","Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook.","The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests?","A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.","Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep) is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, the author of “Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest” and a contributing opinion writer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify.

But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Hawley says a 2010 Supreme Court's ruling that outlawed life sentences for people under 18 who didn't kill anyone applies only to a sentence for one crime.","The former St. Louis judge who sentenced Bostic disagrees. She now believes the term is unjust and is backing Bostic's high-court appeal. There's no timetable for when the justices will decide whether to hear his case.","Now 39, Bostic has been in prison for more than 20 years.","State and federal courts around the country have ruled differently about whether young people convicted of crimes can be sentenced to prison for terms that the American Civil Liberties Union, representing Bostic, said \"exceed their life expectancy.\"","Sally Yates(Photo: Jack Gruber-USA TODAY NETWORK)","The retired judge, Evelyn Baker, is among more than 100 current and former judges, prosecutors and law enforcement officers who are calling on the Supreme Court to throw out the sentence as grossly unfair.

The robbers then carjacked a woman and Hutson robbed and fondled her before releasing her, according to the ACLU's brief. The two men threw the guns in a river and used the money to buy marijuana.","Hutson took a plea deal and got 30 years. Bostic went to trial and lost.","At Bostic's sentencing, Baker said, \"You made your choice. You're gonna have to live with your choice, and you're gonna die with your choice because, Bobby Bostic, you will die in the Department of Corrections.\"","Later, she said, \"I feel nothing for you. I feel the same thing for you that you apparently felt for those victims and you feel for your family.\"","But in an essay published in the Washington Post in February, Baker wrote, \"Scientists have discovered so much about brain development in the more than 20 years since I sentenced Bostic. What I learned too late is that young people's brains are not static; they are in the process of maturing.\"","The Supreme Court has used essentially the same reasoning in barring life sentences for juveniles who didn't kill anyone and in throwing out mandatory life terms for people who kill before they turn 18.","The ACLU wants the court to apply the 2010 ruling to Bostic.","But Hawley, in the state's brief filed Thursday, said there are several reasons the high court should not disturb the Missouri court rulings upholding the sentence. Among them was that the 2010 Supreme Court ruling doesn't apply to Bostic because he \"was sentenced to multiple, consecutive terms in prison for committing multiple crimes, and who will be eligible for parole in great old age.\"","Hawley is seeking the Republican nomination to take on Democratic U.S. Sen.

Except the company wasn't really abusing anything and is just really really good at grabbing all of your data and that's just as important. It went pretty much like so:","Old versions of the Android READ_CONTACTS API bundled your call logs with a contact into the data about the contact itself.","Facebook wants you up upload your contacts so you can see others who also have the Facebook app installed (and can spam the ones who don't) and someone noticed that they could scrape the call logs and get information about who you called, who called you, when, and how long you talked.","Facebook being Facebook didn't bother to tell you it was doing this, but did say in their privacy policy that you can see and remove any data they have about you if you like so technically they were above the board here.","Android was updated and access to call logs was split out of the READ_CONTACTS permission.","The old permission still applied if you had an old phone, didn't revoke it yourself by reinstalling the Facebook app, or had a version of Facebook that was baked in and you didn't have any control over any of this to start with.","When you finally did update and saw the new permissions, you probably didn't read them and tapped install anyway. If you did read them, you probably didn't understand them and didn't bother to find out what they meant.","Zuckerberg buys a volcanic island and begins plans for his doomsday device. Probably.","I'll start by saying what we're all thinking and can all agree on: that's all seriously messed up. But a lot of it is our own fault and that's not something anyone wants to talk about.","Google may be able to \"fix\" this but then we shift trust and responsibility from one company that makes billions from our data to another.","Google should have never let this happen. Another thing most will agree with but is that really what we want? Google cannot see the future nor read anyone's mind. Some of the smartest people in tech work for Facebook and they simply found a way to game a system and they did until they had to stop. You can bet that there are smart people working at places like Facebook and trying to game the current system, too, because your data is what makes these companies worth billions of dollars. More of your data equals more dollars and if you can bring in more dollars to the company you work for some of it trickles down to you. And it's not Google's responsibility to monitor what you install and what you don't; it's only there to enforce the rules as best it can and update the rules when it thinks of a better way.","We also can't ignore that people have been telling us all that Facebook was a super shady company for a long time. This isn't even the first time the call-log scraping has been brought up to mostly deaf ears. And we've been told to read permissions and EULAs and everything else we have to agree with before we tap the Yes/Install/DO IT NOW buttons and largely ignored that advice, too. We've been given plenty of information that should have made us take a closer look at what Facebook was doing and most of us chose to ignore it because we didn't understand much of it or simply didn't care.","It's obvious that this all wasn't good enough or that nobody cared. We don't need to look any further than Facebook's current permissions that include the ability to pull all of the data from your call history and then check to see how many installs the app has to prove it. It's right there in black and white now and has been for a while, but people either trusted that Facebook would never do such a thing, didn't bother to even look at the permissions, or saw them and installed the app anyway.","I think and sincerely hope that it's just the difficulty of keeping track of it all and not that nobody cares.","Picking on Facebook is easy because it is so bad. But all of this goes for every app on every screen.","What's less obvious is how it can be fixed. If you're that person who doesn't care what type of information Facebook has on you and is OK with them doing whatever they like with it, you have nothing to worry about here. Please be sure to delete me from your contacts if I happen to be in them, by the way, because I care and Facebook also tries to build a profile on me based on any data you have about me without asking either of us for permission. For everyone else, it's simply time to take some responsibility and police our own actions. That's easier than you might think and here are a few tips to get you started.","Know what you are giving a company and what you get in return. That means think about all the data a huge company like Google collects from you and how they handle that data then decide if it's a good deal for you. It also means to think small and decide if it's worth letting Toyota have access to your contacts so that your car can announce a caller by name while you're driving. Everything is give-and-take, and you need to make sure what they are taking is worth what they are giving.","Every piece of software on every device with a screen has terms you need to agree to before you start using it. Read them. Read every word and question anything you do not understand. Question the answers you get, too, until you're satisfied.","Decide what services you need versus what services you don't. Do you really need Alexa and Cortana and Google Assistant and Siri and Bixby and Roscoe's Rib Rack's automated drive-thru knowing everything about you? Keep the things you need (as long as you're comfortable with the terms) and ditch the things you don't.","Don't sign in to your new Android phone during the setup. Skip past and get everything running so you can see what you might want to uninstall or disable before you've logged in with your Google account. Once you've deleted and disabled the huge amounts of spyware and garbage that companies love to install on your new phone, open the Gmail app and you'll be sent to the sign-in process.","If you find apps on your phone that you can't disable or delete, find out why. The answer could be because of a legitimate need (many Android apps depend on other apps being in place to work) or it could be because that app is from a company interested in things you do and places you go and wants to send data back to the mothership. If, for example, you're not OK that some Android apps need Chrome to be installed and not disabled, make sure your next phone doesn't have Chrome installed. Or iTunes. Or OneNote. Or whatever.","Use some common sense. And it's OK to ask questions if you don't trust your own common sense, too. Nobody is a walking encyclopedia that knows the right answer to everything and you'll always be able to find someone who is an expert on the things you aren't.","The old saying goes \"if you want something done right, you do it yourself.\"","If we don't start taking some responsibility ourselves when it comes to our privacy there are no good outcomes. We don't want or need lawmakers who are older than the transistor itself trying to decide what's best for us, we don't want any one company (like Google) acting as a gateway for all of our personal information. And we don't want to keep seeing things like Facebook screwing us over (and over) until we have nothing left that it wants. We can do this. You can do this.","Jerry Hildenbrand","Jerry is Mobile Nation's resident nerd and proud of it. There's nothing he can't take apart, but many things he can't reassemble.

Nix allegedly asked the WikiLeaks founder whether he could assist in releasing thousands of emails that had gone missing on a private server that had been used by Hillary Clinton. Assange confirmed the contact but said the offer was rejected.","The news prompted a top former campaign official, Michael Glassner, who was executive director of the Trump election campaign, to minimise the role Cambridge Analytica played in electing Trump, despite the fact that it paid Cambridge Analytica millions of dollars in fees.","In a statement on Wednesday, Glassner said that the Trump campaign relied on voter data owned by the Republican National Committee to help elect the president.","“Any claims that voter data from any other source played a key role in the victory are false,” he said.","But that claim is contradicted by a detailed description of the company’s role in the 2016 election given in May by a senior Cambridge Analytica executive.","Speaking at a conference in Germany, Molly Schweickert, the head of digital at Cambridge Analytica, said that Cambridge Analytica models, which melded the company’s own massive database and new voter surveys, were instrumental in day-to-day campaign decisions, including in helping determine Trump’s travel schedule.","The company’s models also helped drive decisions on advertising and how to reach out to financial donors.","Schweickert said Cambridge Analytica started working with the Trump campaign in June 2016.","“It became obvious that a sophisticated data apparatus would be needed to combat the years of infrastructure and experience the Clinton campaign had been building up,” she said.","One of the company’s strategies was to work in “collaboration” with news publishers like Politico, the political news website, which Schweickert said helped the company target a political ad about the Clinton Foundation to readers in key battleground states.","“We knew we would be showing this to the right individuals,” Schweickert said.","In another case, in the late stages of the November election, Schweickert said the company acquired data on voters who voted early – data it collected from local counties and states – and linked the information to individual Facebook profiles.","This helped Cambridge Analytica determine whether people had been exposed to certain political advertisements, and whether those people had turned in their early voting ballots, helping them to predict the outcome of the election.","When asked by a German audience member whether this was legal, given privacy rules in Europe that would “probably” make the activity illegal in Germany, Schweickert responded: “It’s a very different sort of data privacy culture.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

The following year, that company, Eunoia Technologies, subsequently pitched Republican political operative Corey Lewandowski on microtargeting tools that could be deployed on behalf of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Emails from 2014 provided to BuzzFeed News show that Eunoia possessed a database of more than 50 million Facebook profiles at the time. That same information — and Facebook’s wider data collection policies in general — are now being scrutinized following reports by the New York Times and the Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired it from a company called Global Science Research (GSR), which originally collected it for academic purposes.","GSR, Cambridge Analytica, and Wylie said they have since deleted the data. Cambridge Analytica, which Donald Trump’s presidential campaign employed throughout 2016 to build ad-targeting profiles on potential voters, claimed in a statement Friday that none of the Facebook information in question was used for the election. And while there is no current indication Eunoia used the database or pitched it to Lewandowski, the fact that Wylie's little-known startup — which was a wholly distinct entity from Cambridge Analytica — possessed it at all is the latest in a string of revelations in Facebook's data crisis and further evidence that the company is unable to track how the personal profile information it collects is employed and distributed by third parties.","Other documents from Eunoia, which marketed ad microtargeting services to corporate and political clients, reveal that in the spring of 2015 Wylie’s startup pitched elections-related work to Trump’s eventual campaign manager, Lewandowski. One source, who declined to be named for fear of endangering personal and business relationships confirmed the authenticity of these documents; another person, who had direct knowledge of Eunoia’s meeting with Lewandowski, confirmed the Wylie-led startup’s interest in working for the fledgling Trump campaign.","Since blowing the whistle on Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, Wylie has said very little about Eunoia and his aspirations for it. He also has not spoken at all about his startup’s meeting with Lewandowski, who would go on to lead the Trump campaign. In response to BuzzFeed News’ questions about Eunoia last week, Wylie’s lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that her client “has not worked for Republican clients since leaving [Cambridge Analytica]” and that his company had “no data or assets.”","“Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets.”","The documents obtained by BuzzFeed and subsequent interviews with sources do not always cast Wylie in a flattering light, but they also do not call into question his claims about the improper transfer of Facebook user data to political consulting entities. After responding to an initial request for comment, Wylie's attorney went dark and did not answer the questions BuzzFeed News put to her Tuesday.","In a four-hour hearing of the UK Commons select committee on digital culture, media, and sport on Tuesday, Wylie was asked by committee chair Damian Collins if he had benefited from the GSR data set on other projects that he’d worked on outside of Cambridge Analytica.","“I didn’t do any contracts or do any, you know, work with that data,” Wylie replied. “I haven’t worked with any clients … That data got deleted, I believe, in 2015 on my end.”","“SCL Without Alexander Nix”","Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Wylie discussed plans to “build the NSA’s wet dream” in late 2013 while still working at Cambridge Analytica. “Our goal is first to make it an extremely profitable company,” he wrote in late 2013. “Then we will cleanse our souls with other projects, like using the data for good rather than evil. But evil pays more.\"","According to two people who knew Wylie at this time, the SCL microtargeting specialist had approached a number of colleagues about leaving their jobs to join him in a new company. According to one person, Wylie hoped to model his firm after Palantir Technologies, the CIA-backed, Silicon Valley data-mining company.","“He was very much trying to build this company and his vision was, ‘I want to build SCL without [Cambridge Analytica CEO] Alexander Nix,’” said one person who talked to Wylie about his new venture. Last week, Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix pending an investigation after he was recorded by the UK’s Channel 4 touting his firm’s ability to influence foreign elections and discussing techniques to entrap and blackmail political candidates. Cambridge Analytica did not return a request for comment.","By the beginning of 2014, Wylie had put together a presentation for a company called Arg.us. According to its pitch deck, which was seen and published in part by BuzzFeed News, the company said it could ingest users' social media activity to build “psychographic” profiles for marketers who could then target ads to specific users and possibly influence behavior. By the winter of that year, Wylie was having conversations about his idea with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including one who spoke to BuzzFeed News and received a note that said the products that Wylie had promised had been used for previous political clients.","Wylie’s lawyer previously said that Arg.us presentation was “never a serious pitch,” and it’s not clear how it was used. That said, similarities in documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News suggest it was a precursor to Eunoia.","After leaving Cambridge Analytica and SCL in late June of 2014, Wylie pivoted his focus to Eunoia — Greek for “beautiful thinking” — formulating a company that could perform so-called psychographic modeling and targeting for its clients. By August, he was working at Eunoia with Tobias Kloepper, a one-time SCL data scientist who would obtain Facebook data for the young startup. Emails viewed by BuzzFeed News indicate that Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist and founder of GSR, shared a database of more than 50 million Facebook users with Kloepper.","Kogan and Kloepper did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unclear if Wylie ever used that data, with the whistleblower noting in front of a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that he eventually deleted it because “I wasn’t going to do anything with it.”","Correspondence between Wylie and an acquaintance from September 2014 show that, while Wylie was particularly interested in courting fashion industry clients, he claimed to also have meetings with Monsanto, the American Petroleum Institute, and Ford. A Eunoia fashion-focused presentation from the time obtained by BuzzFeed News said the company had a “database that contains the information of hundreds of millions of individual consumers with emails, Facebook/Twitter IDs and mailing addresses,” while a separate company brochure specifically discusses targeting voters for potential political clients. Neither document mentions the specific GSR data set of 50 million Facebook users, and it’s unclear if Eunoia ever put that data to use.","“The heart of our work stems from a rigorous scientific understanding of human behavior, which in turn allows us to engineer more responsive audiences and engage consumers more precisely,” read the brochure. “To do this, we have developed a series of algorithms that can predict the personality traits of individual voters by analyzing their voterfile [sic], social, online and consumer data.”","Neither the presentation nor the brochure mention the provenance of that \"social, online and consumer data.\"","Provided to BuzzFeed News","A presentation slide for fashion clients from Eunoia Technologies.","According to one person, GSR gave its data to Eunoia after Kogan had negotiated an agreement where the startup would receive the information without charge as part of a data-sharing agreement between the two parties. Wylie never provided Kogan with data of his own, this person said, and GSR moved to cancel its agreements with Eunoia in early 2015. Eunoia appears to never have officially launched; a separate source told BuzzFeed News that it was unable to secure funding.","Data On The Loose","The contested data set, which GSR harvested using a 2014 Facebook personality quiz where users permitted the app to obtain personal information about themselves and their friends, has kick-started investigations from governments around the world. In the US, multiple members of Congress have asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill about the social network’s data policies and how the information of more than 50 million users could have ended up in the hands of a company doing elections consulting work.","As BuzzFeed News has learned, the spread of the Facebook data was not confined to Cambridge Analytica. Wylie may have had access to the data set for more than a year after founding Eunoia, with Facebook only acting to address the violation of its rules in late 2015, after the release of a story in the Guardian. GSR was told to delete its data in December 2015, according to a source, while Wylie said in testimony in front a parliamentary committee Tuesday that he believed he deleted the GSR data “some time in 2015” after being contacted by Kogan.","Earlier this month, after learning that several outlets were working on stories about the Trump campaign–hired data analysis company, the social networking giant moved to suspend the Facebook accounts of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, and Wylie. Facebook declined to comment for this story.","\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post last Wednesday. He added that the company would investigate “all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014.” The company took out full-page ads in several newspapers last Sunday apologizing for the mistake.","Asked last week if Eunoia had used any data sets on Facebook users, Wylie’s lawyer, Allen, was adamant. “Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets,” she wrote.","Provided to BuzzFeed News","Eunoia business cards","Eunoia And Trump’s Campaign Manager","In an interview with NBC’s Today show last week, Wylie drew a line between Cambridge Analytica and Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “What I do know is that Cambridge Analytica was meeting with Corey Lewandowski in 2015 before Trump had even announced and offering the services that I’m talking about right now,” he said.","What Wylie didn’t say is that Eunoia Technologies also met with Lewandowski around the same time. According to one source, Lewandowski met with representatives of the company, including Tadas Jucikas, a former SCL employee, and Mark Gettleson, Eunoia’s communications and marketing strategist, around Easter Sunday 2015 in the lobby of a New York Central Park hotel. Wylie did not attend the meeting, said the person, but he was well aware of it and its purpose to discuss voter microtargeting for a possible presidential candidate.","Drew Angerer / Getty Images","Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski arrives at Trump Tower in December 2016 in New York City.","While Trump’s campaign went on to work with Cambridge Analytica later in 2016, the person said that Lewandowski met with Eunoia, in part, because the Alexander Nix operation was already working for Ted Cruz’s presidential election team at the time. According to that source, that meeting included “high-level discussions” about microtargeting techniques and did not include any talk about Facebook data.","Jucikas declined to comment. Gettleson did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including phone calls, emails, and a visit to his London home. Lewandowski, who became Trump’s official campaign manager when the billionaire announced his candidacy in June 2015, did not respond to a request for comment.","Emails obtained by BuzzFeed News further corroborate the pitch to the Trump campaign. In April 2015, following the meeting with Lewandowski, Gettleson, a political operative with UK’s liberal democratic party, sent an email with the subject line “Trump” to a graphic designer who had been designing business cards and brochures for the company. The email included an attachment labeled “Trump-Handout,” which contained a list of various political microtargeting products and services offered by the company. The graphic designer made a few adjustments to the document and placed its contents on official Eunoia stationery before sending it back to Gettleson in a PDF called “eunioa_stationary_introletter.” It’s unclear if these documents were then sent to Lewandowski or if Eunoia had any further meetings with Trump’s eventual campaign manager.","A cache of documents sent to BuzzFeed News by a source, which included business contracts and pitch decks, reveal other individuals who, to varying degrees, were associated with the fledgling startup. Many of those people did not want to talk about their involvement with the company or did not return BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment. Ray Larson, a former strategist for Canada’s liberal party, did not respond to emails and a phone message; Brent Clickard, a former colleague of Wylie’s at SCL declined to comment. A source close to Clickard said that while he spoke with Wylie about working at Eunoia, the pair never formalized an agreement.","Alfredas Chmieliauskas, a London-based employee of Palantir, said he had “no idea” why his name was on Eunoia’s business documents, adding that while Wylie knew “a former school friend of mine ... we never had a working relationship of any sort.” On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Chmieliauskas, while at Palantir, began corresponding with Wylie in 2013 and later gave him the idea to develop the quiz app, eventually employed by Kogan, to harvest Facebook user data. Wylie also visited with Palantir, with a company spokesperson later confirming that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica considered working together at one point.","Correspondence from Wylie that was given to BuzzFeed News show Wylie bragging to an acquaintance in late 2013 about the prospect of someone from Palantir wanting to join his idea for a startup.","It is not clear if these people, who denied having official work relationships with Eunoia or did not reply altogether, knew that the company had access to a data set with more than 50 million Facebook users or that its associates were meeting with potential presidential campaigns.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record.\"","According to a source, Eunoia also sought to hire Mark Block, the former chief of staff to 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain who had a brief spell of notoriety for smoking a cigarette in a campaign ad. Block’s name and that of his associate, Linda Hansen, were printed on a proof sheet of draft Eunoia business cards given to BuzzFeed News by a second source.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record,” Block said when asked about his relationship with Eunoia and Wylie. Block, who reportedly introduced Steve Bannon to SCL and worked for the company’s elections division as its head of US sales, according to an archived version of SCL’s website, declined to say anything more.","\"There were discussions about politics and some other ex [Cambridge Analytica] staff wanted to continue working in Republican politics,\" Wylie's lawyer said in an email to earlier questions last week. \"However they parted ways with Mr Wylie to set up their own company that does work for Republican clients. ... Mr Wylie has not worked for Republicans since leaving CA and does not wish to in the future.\""],"isopubdate":""}

DataSift, the London-based company that pulls data from conversations across social, news and blog platforms, anonymises it, and then parses it for insights for third party organizations, is being acquired by Meltwater, the company originally out of Norway but now based in San Francisco that provides business intelligence services such as media monitoring and AI analytics on internal business communications.","Financial terms are not being disclosed for the deal but it includes technology, employees and DataSift’s customer base. DataSift had raised about $72 million in funding from investors that include Insight Venture Partners, Scale Ventures and Upfront Ventures and the company had never disclosed its valuation.","Meltwater is bootstrapped and has never raised outside funding, but it has also been described as a “unicorn” with a billion-dollar valuation — a description that the company would not confirm but also does not contest.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts.

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","Christopher Wylie, who helped found the data firm Cambridge Analytica and worked there until 2014, said, “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.” (ANDREW TESTA / New York Times)","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social-media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","Article Continued Below","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s psychographic modelling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with half a dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","Article Continued Below","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators, who are scrutinizing possible data privacy violations and allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. In the United States, Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","In late 2013, Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behaviour. Wylie had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, Wylie recalled. Through a spokeswoman, Bannon declined to comment.","Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict voting behaviour.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time.","When the c declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was a psychology professor at the university. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said. Of those, roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles.","Just as Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dove into the U.S. midterm elections. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in a U.S. election campaign, the company said.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All of the scrutiny appears to have affected business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump’s re-election campaign.","More from The Star & Partners","LOADING","Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The firm connected with Trump’s political adviser Stephen Bannon, whom Wylie also met, the reports said.","Wylie, a 28-year-old from British Columbia, is the data scientist who spoke out about controversy. He’s also the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica.","“I do feel responsible for it and it’s something that I regret,” Wylie said in a video interview posted on The Observer’s web page.","“It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country, without their consent or awareness.”","The reports provided many details about whistleblower who in 2007 or 2008 landed his first political gig with the federal Liberals.","At age 17, he worked in the office of Canada’s opposition leader, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion, said one of the reports. When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama’s campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn’t heard of Wylie — or they barely remembered him.","“I vaguely recall him,” wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. “I think that he was a summer intern.”","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was “pretty junior” and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn’t know Wylie well, they remembered him as a “big advocate of microtargetting.”","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama’s campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ. The firm has come under scrutiny in Britain for its possible role in helping the Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum.","Asked about Wylie, Canada’s Liberal Party said in a statement Sunday that protecting the information of Canadians it engages with is a “foremost priority.”","The party said it has a clear, stringent policy that protects individuals’ private information. It also said its agreements with campaign partners also include strict requirements.","The party insists it doesn’t sell information under any circumstances.","A spokeswoman for Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said Sunday that social-media platforms have a responsibility to help ensure citizens and the democratic processes are protected from “threats like foreign interference, data breaches, hate speech, and misinformation.”","“While some social-media platforms have begun to take initial steps to address these issues, it’s clear that much more needs to be done,” Jordan Owens wrote in an email.","Owens said the government would work with social-media firms to ensure they respect and help preserve the integrity of Canada’s democracy.","Facebook said in a weekend blog post that claims the harvesting of user information was a data breach are “completely false.”","The statement said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his Facebook app.","“People knowingly gave their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” said the post by Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president and deputy general counsel."],"isopubdate":""}
{"originalurl":"https://heavens-burning.blogspot.com/2009/04/nick-took-what-kind-of-knucklehead.html","title":"Heaven's Burning","text":["Wednesday, April 22, 2009","Nick took the \"What kind of knucklehead takes these stupid Facebook quizzes\" quiz with the result \"Too many of his Facebook friends\"","If this looks familiar you probably have a Facebook account. If not, congratulations you are likely well adjusted, sane, have a normal real life and have no need of a virtual peer group. You could probably quit reading now and you won't miss much. If you do have a Facebook account or you are curious please read on.","Facebook is a \"social networking\" site ostensibly designed to facilitate cyber communities of acquaintances and to provide access to events and services not otherwise readily available. I like to think of it as the 'Borg' for all you Trekkies out there (that may be a future topic), because it organizes participants into a homogeneous glump devoid of personal expression. Unlike MySpace or some of the other such sites everyone's page is identically laid-out and subject to a steady stream of mindless babble and advertising. All of that begs the question, why do it?","The attraction to this site seems to revolve around the voyeuristic scrutiny of the activity of one's friends. Titillating as that may sound it comes at a price. It has been argued that people are willing to sacrifice their own privacy for the opportunity to peer into the lives of others. This symbiotic form of relationship wouldn't be so bad if the exchange were limited to one's friends but the access is viral. That is to say that while I can view steady streams of news feeds posted by my friends I can also view things like the photo albums of their friends, people I don't even know. While most of this stuff is so banal it's painful, occasionally something comes across that seems entirely inappropriate. I mean, we're all adults here but there is something pretty creepy about perusing some friend's niece's photos of a bunch of scantily clad adolescents pounding jello shooters in compromising poses. Yes, I've done it and it's not as innocent as the inability to turn one's eyes from the proverbial train wreck. At best it's invasive at worst it's pederasty.","As bad as that seems there is something significantly more pernicious about Facebook and those vile quizzes I mentioned at the outset are just one form of a series of mechanisms rooting about in our psyches. The extent to which this subliminal mind-mining will succeed wholly depends on the willingness of participants. At this point there seems to be limitless and gleeful acceptance. Oh come on you say, don't take yourself so seriously. Well trust me I'm no alarmist, I think maybe the Warren commission called it like it was but this kinda scares me.","There are a couple things that set up my personal paranoia. One is that Facebook was developed by a former executive for an information gathering think-tank enlisted by the CIA. Another is a failed marketing scheme called the beacon which would have linked specific partnering businesses with personal profiles. Activity with those companies would automatically generate news feeds to your friends. Something like \"Nick bought 'Debbie Does Dallas' at Amazon.com today\"would feed out to all my friends. Worse, Amazon can have Friends (or fans as they're called for businesses) who would also get that feed and anyone can be Amazon's friend. Even my parole officer. How would he like to see \"Nick bought a Glock at Sportsmans Wharehouse today\"?","So, with that in mind it seems pretty obvious what these quizzes are all about. At their most innocuous they are about establishing demographics. These quizzes typically ask things like \"Which Muppet are you?\"or\"Which punk rock star are you?\". The inanity of this is palpable. For those of you who found they were Patti Smith I have a news flash: Patti would prefer a non-anesthetized appendectomy to taking one of these quizzes. And, well need I remind anyone that Miss Piggy doesn't actually exist. The geniuses that created and proliferate these applications are building data. Soon you'll be seeing Miss Piggie wristwatches and posable Patti Smith dolls at your local WalMart. Ok that's a little extreme but you can bet the results of these quizzes will find their way into the marketing of goods and services because why else are these applications available.","Does anybody think Facebook subsidizes the development of these 'games'. Hell no, they are paid to host the access. So who is paying for it and why. Is it some misguided old hippie spreading the love, some wealthy hobbyist hoping to share a love for games and puzzles? Uh no! Nothing is free, you can't even walk in the park for free, its use is paid for by taxation. So why should we think we're getting free games from Facebook? We're not, we're paying with our very souls, we're shelling out tidbits of our very essence to the lowest bidder who will turn this information to use in their benefit and against our own.","The other day I saw the most alarming quiz to date, \"Which foreign country are you?\". Several of my Canadian friends found they were America. This generated a rash of dialogue regarding personal and public ideas about US policy and culture. Some of it was not too flattering some of it was conciliatory and some was just stupid. But I had to wonder what would come of this information being so insipidly gathered, who would be looking over those comments and whether they might some day come back to haunt those who made them.","When once asked by an interviewer if he thought people should keep their social distance Bob Dylan said \"I believe people should keep everything they've got\". I'm with him!","4 comments:","I so picture you sitting around at your house in a tin foil hat so that the government can't read your thoughts. Oh, and I'm Italy, because I have a big booty : )I was on Facebook long enough for you to find me! Yay me!"],"isopubdate":""}

But according to President-elect Donald Trump's digital director Brad Parscale, the social media giant was massively influential—not because it was tipping the scales with fake news, but because it helped generate the bulk of the campaign's $250 million in online fundraising.","\"Our biggest incubator that allowed us to generate that money was Facebook,\" says Parscale, who has been working for the campaign since before Trump officially announced his candidacy a year and a half ago. Over the course of the election cycle, Trump's campaign funneled $90 million to Parscale's San Antonio-based firm, most of which went toward digital advertising. And Parscale says more of that ad money went to Facebook than to any other platform.","'Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing.'","Brad Parscale","\"Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing,\" he says. \"Twitter for Mr. Trump. And Facebook for fundraising.\"","In the wake of Trump's stunning upset last week, media analysts have worked feverishly to figure out how social media may have altered the outcome of this election. They—and we—have pointed to online echo chambers and the proliferation of fake news as the building blocks of Trump's victory. But the answer may be much simpler. Of course Facebook was hugely influential in the presidential election, in large part because Trump's campaign embraced Facebook as a key advertising channel in a way that no presidential campaign has before—not even Clinton's.","\"I think the Trump campaign did that extremely well,\" says Andrew Bleeker, president of Bully Pulpit Interactive, which helped lead Hillary Clinton's digital marketing efforts. \"They spent a higher percentage of their spending on digital than we did.\"","Changing Minds Where It Mattered","Throughout the last year-and-a-half, stories about the imbalance between Clinton's ad spending compared to Trump's proliferated. They noted how Clinton spent more than $200 million on television ads in the final months of the election while Trump spent less than half that. Because Trump wasn’t spending as much on television all along, it seemed like his team wasn't investing in changing anyone’s minds. But they were: they were just doing it online.","\"The big takeaway was using digital in a digital-first way,\" says Matt Lira, a Republican digital strategist and senior advisor to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. \"It was the main course. It wasn't leftovers.\"","Facebook proved to be a powerful way for Trump's team to hone the campaign's message with the kind of enormous sample sizes you can't get with traditional polling. \"They have an advantage of a platform that has users that are conditioned to click and engage and give you feedback,\" says Gary Coby, director of advertising at the Republican National Committee, who worked on Trump's campaign. \"Their platform’s built to inform you about what people like and dislike.\"","Coby's team took full advantage of the ability to perform massive tests with its ads. On any given day, Coby says, the campaign was running 40,000 to 50,000 variants of its ads, testing how they performed in different formats, with subtitles and without, and static versus video, among other small differences. On the day of the third presidential debate in October, the team ran 175,000 variations. Coby calls this approach \"A/B testing on steroids.\" The more variations the team was able to produce, Coby says, the higher the likelihood that its ads would actually be served to Facebook users.","\"Every ad network and platform wants to serve the ad that's going to get the most engagement,\" Coby says. \"The more you're testing, the more opportunity you have to find the best setup.\"","The Digital Bully Pulpit","Clinton also had a robust digital strategy, investing $30 million in digital ads in the homestretch. Her campaign produced thousands of rapid-response videos and set up a customer service team to help people with their voting questions. But, says Bleeker, \"the Trump campaign took to an extreme what we were trying to do on the Hillary campaign.\"","The President-elect has shown he can turn a news cycle in 140 characters or less.","Social media was Trump's primary communication channel. It wasn't a platform for broadcasting pre-planned messages but for interacting with supporters and starting new conversations—however controversial those conversations often were. Bleeker says one of the biggest lessons he's learned from this election cycle is that social media is increasingly going to be part of any candidate's so-called \"earned media strategy\"—that is, the coverage a candidate gets for free in the press. The President-elect has shown he can turn a news cycle in 140 characters or less; in a recent 60 Minutes interview, he said he plans to continue using Twitter as president.","\"He’s going to tell his side of the story from the digital bully pulpit,\" Lira says.","Whether fake news did or didn't affect the election's outcome, Facebook as a platform did. The winning candidate was not just willing, but eager to break with traditional models of campaigning. His team invested in new ways of using the digital tools and platforms that have come to dominate the media landscape. Anyone who wants to defeat him in the future will have to do the same."],"isopubdate":"2016-11-15"}

Now that incident, and what followed, is at the center of a debate over how well the world’s largest social network protects its trove of user data.","What is the current fuss about?","In 2007, Facebook provided deep access to app creators and academics. Developers built games, dating apps and other social-friendly software. Meanwhile, researchers and marketers conducted their own studies. By 2015, Facebook clamped down on access, citing user privacy concerns.","But Facebook said it learned in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, broke its data policies when he shared Facebook user data gleaned from his personality-prediction app with others including Cambridge Analytica. The data included not just information on people who downloaded the app but about 30 different data points about those people’s Facebook friends, a surprisingly long reach.","Harvesting the data was allowed at the time, but sharing with others wasn’t. Facebook said it had received assurances the improperly accessed data had been deleted. The company later learned that wasn’t true and couldn’t independently confirm what data had been scrubbed.","Advertisement","Why does that matter so much?","Because it touches on longstanding fears about the enormous amount of information Facebook collects—it has nearly two billion users around the globe—and how that data is used.","Years of controversies came to a head during the 2016 U.S. election, when it was revealed that a handful of Russian actors manipulated Facebook users by spreading misinformation on the social network.","How much data does Facebook really have?","When people use Facebook, they volunteer large amounts of information. It starts with what the social network calls a public profile: name, profile picture, cover photo, gender, networks and user ID.","Advertisement","But it also covers a person’s hometown, religious and political affiliations, work and education histories, and stated relationship interests (i.e., your sexual orientation).","Facebook also keeps tabs on every photo and video that has been uploaded, every post ever written, every place on the map that has been tagged, and every page—on Facebook or out in the web—that users ever “liked” with a click or tap.","In short, whatever users have volunteered to Facebook or interacted with on Facebook becomes part of a profile that can be accessed by developers and targeted by advertisers.","How do app developers get Facebook data?","Many apps and websites offer the option for people to sign in with Facebook. (Some even require it.) Until now, those apps and sites had access to the information in the public profiles.","Advertisement","Going forward, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg says, the only information apps and websites will receive by default will be a person’s name, profile picture and email address. He also said Facebook would curb an app’s access to data if a person hasn’t used that app in three months.","With permission from the user and from Facebook itself, app developers can—and do—get far more. Upon login, the services can ask for specifics such as a friend list, birthday or political beliefs. Before 2015, Facebook even let developers pull detailed information about friends, too. While Facebook has tightened rules, people should check their settings with this guide to see what might still be leaking out.","How does Facebook use this data? Does it give it to advertisers?","Facebook executives stress the company doesn’t sell data directly to advertisers. Handing over user data would be bad for Facebook’s business model, they argue.","What Facebook does is use that trove of information to build targeting tools that can be used by advertisers. The user data is supposed to ensure the ads users see are ones they would actually click on. Marketers can also pay to promote nonadvertising content, such as a post containing a news article, and target it with the same sharp focus.","Advertisement","Facebook also uses data in other ways, including creating a personalized news feed for everyone, every time they log on.","What fixes did Facebook announce Thursday and how significant are they?","Mr. Zuckerberg admitted the company has made mistakes and apologized for the controversy over how it handles user data. He said Facebook will investigate any other potential abuses by app developers who have had access to large amounts of people’s data.","Facebook plans to map out the quantity and type of data app developers requested between 2007 and 2015 (the year it tightened the reins), a far-reaching endeavor. Facebook will start by examining apps that had large user bases—100,000 people or more—and those apps that pulled extensive data about a smaller group of people, said people familiar with Facebook. The process could involve analyzing tens of thousands of apps, some said.","In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Zuckerberg said the company’s investigation into outsiders’ handling of its users’ information will help identify and deter bad actors but won’t be able to uncover where all the data ended up and how it is being.","“Like any security precaution, it’s not that this is a bulletproof solve,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.

While Mr. Nix’s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference, Democrats on the committee want a fuller review. “It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica,” they said in a report this month.","Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm’s commercial division “discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.” The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.","Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.","“We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,” he wrote in response to a question from The Times. “Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL.

Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged.","Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March. The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.","Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.","Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users’ anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.","Facebook’s shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday.

Mercer has funded a wide range of conservative campaigns and causes, including Breitbart. Through the Mercer Family Foundation, he has funded a wide network of climate denialist groups including the Heartland Institute, the Manhattan Institute, the Media Research Center, and the Oregon Institute for Science and Medicine.","But several key directors at Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL Group, also have close ties to the fossil fuel industry, according to business records filed with the British government, fossil fuel company presentations obtained by Motherboard, and employee LinkedIn pages.","The connections show that, yet again, there is often crossover between fossil fuel interests and politically focused firms. SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment for this article.","Big Coal","Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of British company SCL Group, a former UK Ministry of Defence contractor which retains close ties to the British Foreign Office (FCO) and other elements of the UK political and financial establishment. SCL Group set up a subsidiary called SCL Elections in 2012 which, in turn, set up Cambridge Analytica as an incorporated venture with Mercer.","Media coverage to date has understandably focused on the persona of Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who is a director of the firm’s UK alter-ego, SCL Elections.","British company records, however, show that SCL Elections had another director, Christian Patrick Teroerde, who joined the company just months after it was incorporated. Teroerde went on to hold a one-year director role at SCL Elections from February 2013 to 2014.","Teroerde’s position coincided with a simultaneous role he held at another company, Hanson Asset Management, where he has been co-founding managing director since 2010.","One of the major contributors to Lord Hanson’s wealth was the burgeoning American coal industry.","Among Hanson’s major acquisitions, for instance, was the Peabody Holding Company, the largest coal producer in the United States in the 1990s. The firm was sold and grew into Peabody Energy—now the largest private-sector coal company in the world.","In April 2016, Peabody filed for bankruptcy due to plummeting coal prices. Trump’s election victory, which Cambridge Analytica helped target ads for, turned Peabody’s imminent collapse around. One day after Trump’s win, Peabody shares surged by over 50 percent, and six months later the global coal giant came out of bankruptcy.","Cambridge Analytica’s connection to Hanson’s wealth appears to have been close during that founding year. The company correspondence address for Teroerde’s directorship at SCL Elections was the same address as Hanson Asset Management, meaning he essentially fulfilled his duties to the company from the Hanson office.","Big Oil","Cambridge Analytica has other ties to fossil fuel interests. Julian Wheatland has been chairman of Cambridge Analytica parent company SCL group since 2009. During this period, Wheatland has simultaneously held a number of other directorships in companies with overlapping energy and military interests.","One such company is Phi Energy Group, a short-lived oil venture where Wheatland was a director from 2014 to 2016. According to an internal company presentation deck, Phi Energy’s focus was “exploring opportunities” in Libya, the US, Africa and Eastern Europe.","Image: a Phi Energy presentation","Wheatland is listed in the document as Phi Energy Group’s Chief Finance Officer; he also lists that position on his LinkedIn page. The document identifies the companies that Phi Energy worked with: Shell, Noble Group, Eni, Esso, BP, Statoil, Tamoil, Total and Saras—a veritable who’s who of international oil majors.","Since 2009, Wheatland has also been Chief Executive of Hatton International, a company about which almost no public information can be found. The Phi Energy document shows, however, that Hatton also overlapped with fossil fuel interests.","Image: Phi Energy presentation","Phi Energy’s presentation deck lists its then-Chief Commercial Officer as Tarick Kreimeia, who is described as “a Director of Hatton International” working under Wheatland.","According to Kreimeia’s LinkedIn profile, he was a “non-executive director” of Hatton International from 2012 to 2016. That profile not only refers to Hatton’s work “with defence and aerospace companies”, but further describes how Hatton “supports client companies, particularly in the energy industry, to develop financing strategies that will deliver the strategic objectives and help bring new products and propositions to market.”","The regions where Phi Energy/Hatton’s energy work was carried out include Iraq and Libya, both subjected to US-UK military interventions.","Kreimeia’s Phi Energy bio, for instance, depicts him as a key player in negotiating refining agreements in key Middle East countries, specifically assisting major EU refineries in negotiations with the Libyan National Oil Company (LNOC), the Iraqi State Oil Marketing Company and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG).","Climate denialism","An investigation by DeSmogUK reveals that Cambridge Analytica is also embedded in a web of power denying climate change. Besides the Mercer funding, Cambridge Analytica has numerous ties to Vote Leave, the official British campaign to leave the European Union, which was chock full of politicians who rejected climate science.","Vote Leave was run by Dominic Cummings, a former head of strategy for the Conservative Party. The Vote Leave campaign paid £3.5m for Facebook profiling and advertising to AggregateIQ, a Canadian firm which had secretly licensed its data tools to SCL Elections.","Cummings is also connected to SCL Elections and Hanson Asset Management director Patrick Teroerde, through Lord Hanson. From 1999 to 2002, Cummings had run the anti-EU ‘Business for Sterling’ business lobby, founded by Lord Hanson. Neither Teroerde nor Cummings could be reached for comment.","The pro-fossil fuels agenda of the Vote Leave campaign was no secret.","One senior Vote Leave committee member, Andrea Leadsom, currently Leader of the House of Commons and previously energy and climate minister, admitted to questioning climate change science when she first got her ministerial job. During the Brexit campaign, she was aligned with a pressure group agitating for more fossil fuels and less renewables.","Two other Conservative politicians who supported Vote Leave, Owen Paterson and Matt Ridley, are “well-known allies of the UK’s most prominent climate science denial campaign group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation,” according to DeSmogUK.","And so we come full circle. Cambridge Analytica’s political associations with the Trump campaign in the US, and the Brexit campaign in the EU, overlap directly with the firm’s ties to major oil and gas companies and anti-science campaigning to deny climate change.","The story of this firm’s massive breach of Facebook to manipulate public opinion is not just about the increasing impunity of giant technology companies, nor their capacity to allow nefarious entities to interfere in our fragile democracies from outside.","It is about how technology has been used to subvert democracy from within—not by foreign powers—but by increasingly unaccountable corporate power, including those tied to the rampant exploitation of oil, gas and coal. It’s power that continues to hold great sway over governments on both sides of the Atlantic."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Today, the organization announced a new tool it said will help keep Facebook from tracking your browsing across the web.","The Facebook Container add-on for Firefox promises to make it “much harder” for Facebook to track you when you’re not on its site. Mozilla has been working on the technology for several years already, accelerating its development in response to what it called a “growing demand for tools that help manage privacy and security,” according to a statement issued by Mozilla today.","Most people are probably aware that data they directly give to Facebook — such as “liking” a Page or updating their relationship status — may be sold to advertisers. But fewer people know that Facebook can also track their activities on other websites that have integrated with aspects of Facebook’s tracking technology, such as the pervasive “Like” button. And it’s in this scenario that Mozilla is now hoping to play the good guy.","The add-on, which can be installed through the usual means in Firefox, essentially “isolates” your Facebook profile from the rest of your web browsing, meaning you can use Facebook as usual without experiencing the off-site tracking part.","How it works","As its name suggests, the Facebook Container add-on is, well, a container — you access Facebook from within a little silo that is disconnected from the rest of your browser. When you install the extension in the first instance, all your existing Facebook cookies and data will be deleted.","When you next go to log in to Facebook, the site will load in a separate blue-colored tab, which serves as the “container.”","Above: Facebook Container add-on","If you interact with a Facebook share button from within another Firefox tab it will load within the Facebook Container tab, but Facebook will know that you have interacted with that third-party website. It’s also worth noting here that Facebook comments and Like buttons on websites in other tabs won’t work, and you may also encounter problems if you try to log in to a website using your Facebook credentials on third-party websites.","While it’s true that you can already browse privately in Firefox via a “private window,” doing so means that you will access all websites in that mode, not just Facebook. The add-on is purely about keeping Facebook from tracking you passively as you shift from website to website, though as noted it may “break” some Facebook Platform features that you have become accustomed to using on third-party sites. But hey, you can’t have it all ways.","Today’s announcement comes a month after Google rolled out a new filter within Chrome to block ads that don’t comply with standards set out by the Coalition for Better Ads. Last week, Mozilla announced its 2018 roadmap for Firefox, which also includes a blocker for “bad ads,” as well as other tools to prevent autoplaying video and provide breach alerts, something the company had previously tested.","The Facebook Container add-on fits into that broader scheme of things, insofar as Mozilla wants to position Firefox as a privacy- and security-focused browser. And what better way to capitalize on Facebook’s current privacy scandal than by launching an add-on that promises to keep the company from tracking you?","“There’s an important conversation going on right now about the power that companies like Facebook wield over our lives,” Firefox VP Nick Nguyen said in a blog post. “These businesses are built on technology platforms that are so complex, it’s unreasonable to expect users to fully understand the implications of interacting with them. As a user of the internet, you deserve a voice and should be able to use the internet on your own terms.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

According to the Guardian, it started with researchers concluding they could form complex personality profiles of people by what they \"like\" on Facebook, determining intelligence, history of trauma, and more based on responses to posts on innocuous subjects like curly fries and Hello Kitty. Researcher Aleksandr Kogan signed a deal with Cambridge Analytica—which had Stephen Bannon in a leading role—and in 2014 developed a personality quiz that would not only harvest the data of the Facebook users who took it but also all of their friends.","Around 270,000 Facebook users took the quiz—agreeing to allow their data to be used for academic purposes; their friends didn't even agree to that—which allowed Kogan to harvest the data of over 50 million Facebook users and pass it along to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policies. The company used it to create psychographic profiles of about 30 million US voters and target political ads toward them. Facebook found out in 2015 and demanded the data be deleted, Quartz reports. But Facebook didn't publicly acknowledge the leak until Friday and, despite claims to the contrary, it appears Cambridge Analyitica still has a good portion of the data. Cambridge Analytica, which has now been banned by Facebook, is also facing the possibility of having run afoul of US election laws and is being looked into by the Mueller investigation.","Well, since they were only targeting idiots who were likely Trump voters, this doesn't bother me one bit.","TwoSheds","Mar 18, 2018 5:26 AM CDT","The Guardian article makes a good point at the end.

U.S. companies, he warned, are not prepared to have China cut out of their supply chains or business models.","\"The immediate thing will be an economic crisis because these enterprises are built on long-term planning, they've developed a skilled workforce and ways of doing things. We have to rediscover these things in whatever country after the imports are cut off,\" he told CNBC at the annual China Development Forum.","\"It's just chaos: It will slow down development in the future if people think that this kind of thing is likely,\" he added.","The U.S. president had also announced tariff plans for up to $60 billion in Chinese imports, although China didn't officially connect its Friday threats of retaliation to that White House action.","The U.S. goods threatened by Beijing include wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol, and ginseng, the ministry said. Those products could see a 15 percent duty, while a 25 percent tariff could be imposed on U.S. pork and recycled aluminium goods, according to an official statement.","Adam Jeffery | CNBC","Robert Shiller","Shiller said he did not believe there would be a significant inflationary effect to the U.S. from steel and aluminum tariffs, but he warned that heated trade rhetoric from both sides could send the American economy reeling into a recession.","\"When you ask about the size of the impact on the economy, I think a lot of it is more psychological than direct, unless they really slam on tariffs,\" he said. The Yale economist pointed to the \"most famous tariff war of all\" during the Great Depression, which he said did not \"plausibly, directly\" affect economic growth \"in a major degree,\" but it may have helped \"destroy confidence\" and willingness to plan for the future.","\"It's exactly those 'wait and see' attitudes that cause a recession,\" he explained.","'Totally unbecoming'","The global economy has been firing on all cylinders in recent months. A trade war could end that strong momentum, but the last year of growth means there's \"a little capacity to absorb\" any trade-related jitters, Shiller said.","By that token, he said, Trump's decision to go on the trade offensive could be deemed \"good timing.\"","\"If he did this during 2009 it would have been catastrophic,\" Shiller said. \"But I think his timing is just his own personal timing for this: He's been president for a year, it's about time he does something that gets people's excitement going. He has a philosophy of life that that's what you have to do: If you want to stay famous, celebrity — which he obviously relishes — you've got to be constantly creating news.\"","On that point, the Nobel Prize winner recalled Trump's recent Twitter posts about former Vice President Joe Biden. The language of the president's message, Shiller said, \"was like school yard 'I'm going to beat you up.'\"","Shiller also questioned the fitness of others in the Trump administration, saying the president \"has hired some extremist people.\" He cited Peter Navarro, the White House trade advisor who wrote books called \"Death by China\" and \"The Coming China Wars.\"","\"It seemed to me that no responsible president would give credence to that, but here we are.

The Facebook CEO has been invited—and pressured—to appear before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee as well as other panels, including the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees.","Zuckerberg’s appearance would be a big deal in multiple ways, and it would signal to the world that Facebook is taking seriously the fallout from its data-privacy scandal. But it’s no wonder the company has been reluctant to put its chief under oath on Capitol Hill: There are a lot of ways it could go very wrong—especially with Zuckerberg in the hot seat.","First of all, Zuckerberg is simply not very good at this type of thing. Always an awkward presence, he has turned himself into a passable public speaker over the years—as long as he’s working from a script. He still struggles, however, when confronted with tough questions in live, impromptu settings. He famously flubbed an appearance at a tech conference in 2010, prompting one editor to describe him as “literally dissolving in a lake of his own sweat.” Since then, his preparation has improved, and he has learned to sound somewhat more natural as he spouts carefully rehearsed answers.","In his media tour last week, which included a TV interview on CNN, Zuckerberg managed to sound plausibly sincere without saying anything overly controversial—which might be partly because he and his team took three full days to prepare after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke out earlier this month. But it wasn’t so long ago—December 2016—that Zuckerberg inflamed critics by calling it “pretty crazy” to think fake news could have had any influence on the U.S. election, among other foot-in-mouth moments.","Congress would put Zuckerberg beneath a harsher spotlight than he’s experienced before. Not only will he be under oath, but he’ll be fielding blunt questions from grandstanding legislators that are liable to be less predictable, less technically literate, and frankly ruder than those asked by journalists such as David Kirkpatrick or CNN’s Laurie Segall.","While it was absolutely a dodge, there’s also some truth to the excuse Zuckerberg gave Wiredlast week as to why he hasn’t testified in the past. The CEO really isn’t always the most informed person at a company when it comes to the detailed workings of its products or policies. He’ll have to be well-briefed by lawyers and lower-level executives to learn enough that he doesn’t come across as bumbling or out of touch. He’ll also have to be careful to avoid saying anything that turns out not to be true. Congress really doesn’t like it when you do that.","And at the same time, he’ll have to avoid condescending to lawmakers who ask questions that, from a technological perspective, make no sense. That’s often a challenge for people like Zuckerberg, who were blessed with brilliant engineering minds but not so much natural grace or charm.","More worryingly for Facebook, Zuckerberg will be pressed along partisan lines from two opposing sides, each of which are convinced that Facebook has wronged them in different ways. Facebook is terrified of being seen as politically biased, and Zuckerberg will have to dispatch each side’s concerns without giving fodder to the other.","There’s one more reason Facebook would almost certainly prefer to put someone other than Zuckerberg on the stand. His presence alone will ensure that the hearing makes front-page headlines, drawing out an already damaging news cycle in which Facebook has been cast as a villain. And if he goes, that will put pressure on fellow CEOs such as Google’s Sundar Pichai and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey to do the same. A lineup of those three CEOs would call to mind the infamous tobacco hearings of 1994—not a flattering look for companies that like to think of themselves as forces for good in the world.","The best-case scenario for Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill might be that he comes across as anodyne, well-rehearsed, and robotic. The worst case is that he’s thrown off his game to the point where he commits a Kinsley gaffe—accidentally saying what he really thinks, rather than what will keep him and his company out of trouble.","Assuming Zuckerberg does indeed testify, his battle to stay on script while keeping his armpits dry should make for compelling, if awkward, viewing. Unless you work for Facebook, in which case you might prefer to hide your eyes."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

{"originalurl":"https://www.gq.com/story/ari-melber-cambridge-analytica-facebook","title":"What the Cambridge Analytica Scandal Means for the Future of Facebook | GQ","text":["What the Cambridge Analytica Scandal Means for the Future of Facebook","A conversation with MSNBC’s Ari Melber about Facebook’s uphill battle and the case for regulation.","Already, the Cambridge Analytica–Facebook scandal involves so many layers, angles, and lurid buzzwords—stolen data! bribery! viral entrapment videos! \"Ukrainian girls\"!—that it's already become difficult to distinguish between confirmed facts, educated guesses, and total fiction. At the very least, we know that Cambridge Analytica, which earned a moderate level of notoriety after serving as the digital firm for the Trump campaign, obtained the personal data of some 50 million Facebook users in a way that violated Facebook's privacy policies—and maybe some state and federal laws, too. Facebook found out about the breach in 2015. It wasn't until The New York Times and other outlets published stories on the subject last week, though, that the company delivered anything more than a private slap on the wrist.","Confusingly, around the same time the Facebook story broke, UK's Channel 4 News released a video showing Cambridge Analytica officials pitching some of their more nefarious services to a reporter posing as a prospective client. The company, they revealed, could create videos of a political opponent accepting a bribe, or send \"girls\" to the opponent's house to catch them in a compromising situation. And in a separate clip, the officials brag that their data analysis and/or propaganda-creation methods were instrumental to the Trump campaign's success. The extent to which these claims are anything more than opportunistic salesmanship is unclear, and there is no evidence that the shadily obtained data was used in the Trump digital operation. According to ABC News, though, Robert Mueller wants to find out for himself.","The scandal has dominated the news cycle in large part because it crams illicit data leaks, undercover reporters, billion-dollar corporations, political intrigue, and House of Cards–esque plot devices into the same headlines as the name of a president who already operates under a perpetual cloud of suspicion. But for Facebook, the problem laid bare by the Cambridge Analytica story is about more than just Cambridge Analytica. As Facebook evolved over the past 14 years from Harvard novelty to a publicly traded behemoth, it accumulated a near-unfathomable amount of data about its base of more than 2 billion active users, many of whom freely shared their entire lives without thinking about how valuable that information might be—or, in the wrong hands, how dangerous.","Today's Facebook is a global, for-profit institution that functions as a hybrid digital directory, online marketplace, instant communications service, video-on-demand platform, civic-engagement tool, virtual public square, and curated one-stop news source. For many people, it is the Internet. It quickly outgrew the relevant regulatory schemes, most of which were built decades ago with only the relatively meager capabilities of its media predecessors in mind. It is now so big that when—just as a hypothetical example—it is used to facilitate the deliberate dissemination of fabricated \"news\" stories in a way that might have helped swing a presidential election, it poses the worst kind of problem: one for which there is no objective, readily identifiable method of fixing.","Watch:","Lil Yachty Says He Once Had a Jewelry Addiction","Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the media rounds on Wednesday for the first time since the story broke, apologizing for the company's \"mistakes\" and vowing to more carefully safeguard user data in the future. As noted by The Verge, though, his most interesting comments came when he was asked about the scandal's potential implications for the future of companies like Facebook. For most business executives, the answer to \"Should your industry be more closely regulated?\" is some polite version of \"Hell, no.\" This time, Zuckerberg didn't seem as confident.","I actually am not sure we shouldn’t be regulated. I think that in general, technology is an increasingly important trend in the world. I think the question is more what is the right regulation, rather than \"Yes or no, should we be regulated?\"","He may get his wish soon. The Federal Election Commission is considering new rules for political ads on the Internet, and both the Federal Trade Commission and several state attorneys general have opened probes into the Cambridge Analytica matter. Several legislators have called for Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. In the past, he's sent his lawyers to Capitol Hill. This time, he says he's \"happy to\" do it himself.","Regulating any industry is hard, and the nature of this one—transnational tech giants whose products play integral roles in our everyday lives, and evolve far more often than the Federal Register is published—means that legislators and regulators everywhere (and the billions of people who pay their salaries and depend on their competence) are staring down a challenge of unprecedented stakes and scope. Since the 2016 election, Ari Melber has been assiduously covering some of the more troublesome intersections of democracy, privacy, and technology on his show, The Beat with Ari Melber (6:00 E.T., weeknights on MSNBC). As this story continues to develop, I spoke with Ari about why Facebook's reckoning is overdue—and what a forthcoming brave new world of regulated social media might look like.","GQ: How much trouble are Facebook and Cambridge Analytica in? And... with whom, exactly?","Ari Melber: With stories like this, people always look first to what rules have been broken. Here, for example, there are internal rules established by Facebook to which all app developers agree when they offer a product about what happens to users’ personal information. There are international implications, too, depending on what laws or agreements may be in force in different countries.","But the rush to focus on the minutiae of the rules can come at the expense of looking at bigger moral and societal questions, too. Facebook lost $50 billion this week because people are learning about this company's core conflict between its business model and the personal rights and freedoms of its user base. The company’s priorities revolve around profiting off their users. While any company can pursue profits, Facebook is facing the strain of an inherent conflict: They claim to treat users as customers, or even a \"community,\" but as many tech experts have shown, the customers are actually the product. Users tend to come not second for Facebook, but something like fourth or fifth.","What evidence is there that Cambridge Analytica did anything shady and/or unlawful that actually affected the 2016 presidential election?","I don't think there's public evidence that would give us some indication of how these new scandals informed what Cambridge did for Trump. It is entirely possible that most of what they did was lawful or conventional. It may have involved tricks or manipulation, but all as part of the rough and tumble world of politics, whether online or offline.","What we know is that this is the group that the campaign chose, and one with which the Mercers and Steve Bannon were more than just “involved”—they were running it, as its financials and board activities show. The Mercers were also interested in whether Cambridge Analytica could help boost the impact of material that Wikileaks was releasing in a way that would cause maximum political harm for Hillary Clinton. That gives you a window into the company’s mindset—whether they were observing careful boundaries, or perhaps crossing over the line.","Even with all that we don’t know, I think it’s fair to say that this was a major group linked to the Trump campaign at the highest levels. Brad Parscale, who oversaw this relationship, has now been promoted to run the entire Trump reelection effort. The videos show how the company markets itself abroad, and reveal a certain attitude about rules and ethics. The boasting about what they do, and their approaches to online manipulation, and “information dominance,” and alternative facts—which overlaps with a key tenet of the Trump campaign—all of those things together give you a view of what they are doing. Even if this app data wasn't widely used to benefit Trump, if there are profitable dirty tricks being employed by an entity involved with the president’s campaign, that’s a big story.","If, as some have suggested, Cambridge Analytica's services are less effective than advertised, does the Trump campaign’s decision to retain them matter?","Anyone who has been around political consultants understands that they play a strange role, vacillating between being supreme, successful Machiavellian strategists and useless, expensive people on the margins of politics. One reason the special counsel’s probe is so useful is that, in addition to bringing criminals to justice, it might extinguish the claims of people who were, more or less, bragging that they might be criminals. If Cambridge—or anyone else around Trump—inflated what they could do, or who they contacted, or how they did things, and are now withdrawing to the truth, that’s useful for all of us who are interested in getting to the truth.","Having said that, it is true as a matter of outcomes that the Donald Trump campaign did beat expectations and most of the smart money in Washington. It did it so spending less than Hillary Clinton, and less than his primary campaign rivals. It do so largely on the strength of \"earned media\"—that is, instead of buying ads, you \"earn\" it by via TV coverage and online buzz. Much of that might stem from Donald Trump's style, and from his tweets. But some of it may also relate to the role played by this firm. It’s possible that they inflated their role, but still played a substantive one.","What should Mark Zuckerberg's message be going forward?","For those of us who hope Facebook will improve—who see this as an issue of social and corporate accountability, and who think that the world would be a better place with a Facebook that is more truthful and more respectful of human rights—Zuckerberg’s message has to be built on action and substance, not on PR. He needs to acknowledge the business conflict, and lay out a plan for navigating it. Their resistance to this might come from a human place of fear, or from a corporate place of risk aversion. But as the last few days have shown, it isn’t in his interests to evade accountability any longer.","He needs to demonstrate that he's willing to have a public accounting for this company's actions. He should testify before Congress. He should talk to a range of journalists, not just the tech ones—although they certainly know what they're talking about, and can perhaps lead the conversation. He should talk to journalists who specialize in law and democracy.","I don't think any serious person suggests that they should become a charity. They're a publicly-traded company, and they can pursue their profit. But their increasingly absurd insistence that everything they do is about “community” and “communication” and “connecting” has undermined their ability to have open, transparent discussions with critics and stakeholders about their future.","Why haven’t social media companies like Facebook been regulated to date?","Many tech companies are still so new that—simply by virtue of their youth—they have never been subject to the kind of regulation we see in media, or in other industries. That isn't the product of any considered judgment that they don't merit regulation. It's an accidental result of how new they are, and of how long it takes Congress to study issues, respond to problems, create agencies, and write laws. Right now, it’s just a patchwork of some media regulation, some Federal Trade Commission regulation, and whatever Congress does or doesn’t do to update existing election laws.","To pick a concrete example, in election law, there are disclosure obligations that apply to other media, like television, but that don't apply online. You're less likely to know an ad's true origins if it runs on the Internet than if it runs on TV. If you're a citizen, that doesn't help you. And if you're like a lot of citizens, who today get more information online than they do from TV, it probably hurts you, because it leaves you in the dark. There's no good reason for this Internet loophole to exist.","How is Facebook likely to respond to regulation? What are the possible drawbacks of acting here?","Facebook touts their technical acumen for every possible part of the site, except when it comes to resolving problems like these. When they want to fix something, or make a problem go away, they’re pretty good at doing so. When they don’t, the lectures come about how impossible it is to do things, or that what happens on the site doesn’t matter and doesn’t influence anyone.","I just don’t think that that argument is on the board anymore. Everyone knows how people use this site, and why it’s so omnipresent. Wall Street has spoken about its value. It touches people every day. It’s one of the most influential media/social/utility companies in the world.","The greatest drawback to regulation is potential interference with the innovation that is vital to Silicon Valley. If you look back in history, there are examples of very smart people in Congress and in regulatory agencies who were unable to foresee what might be valuable or useful to society, and who made poor regulatory decisions as a result. Tech companies have a point when they say that a rush to enact broad regulation in response to a particular problem of the moment could create more problems than it solves. That's a fair warning. I hope no one mistakes my attempts to highlight Facebook's conflicts as any kind of beef with the good the Valley has done in the world.","\"If the government were involved in ensuring that there is more transparency and labeling on social media, and less fraud and fakery—and if done right—all users would notice is... more truth and less crap!\"","Having said all that, the opposite side of that coin is that when you fight any and all regulation so much that you suppress any public-private partnership to address these problems, the backlash you earn can be so great that you actually become a handmaiden to your own overregulation. Facebook may be headed for that.","How might regulation change the user experience?","It’s called the “News Feed,” and yet it’s sometimes full of lies and crap. If the government were involved in ensuring that there is more transparency and labeling on social media, and less fraud and fakery—and if done right—all users would notice is... more truth and less crap!","When people go into a store to buy a Louis bag, they don’t think a great deal about the FTC’s enforcement of trademark provisions that stop people from peddling fake Louis bags. They just buy a Louis bag. Well-done regulation should protect the user, but it shouldn't be omnipresent, and shouldn't affect the user that much.","What forms might this regulation take? Who or what is qualified to make sure this is \"done right\"?","As a legal matter, you could create a whole agency that regulates social media. I'm not suggesting that that's a good or bad thing—but it's certainly a constitutional possibility.","The easiest, quickest thing would be for Congress to modernize election law to reflect the Internet's growing role in elections. These are statutes that the FEC enforces, and honestly, updating them isn’t that big a deal. It probably should have happened already, if you think it's good to regulate elections so we know that Americans are participating in them and that foreigners are not. There shouldn't be a loophole for things done on the Internet.","There is also the question about whether federal law or the FEC should be dealing differently with the most rampant cases of lies and fraud. I think foreign espionage would be one place to start, because there aren't a lot of constitutional rights implicated by, say, North Korea trying to defraud our citizens. Domestically, though, things get much more complex, because the Supreme Court has held that we generally have the right to lie. That's still a First Amendment right that people can exercise online and off.","The biggest-picture issue—the pie-in-the-sky discussion—is that today, most people would probably be more concerned about someone rifling through their phone than going through their bedroom drawers. What does it mean to \"protect our rights\" online? How do you hold accountable companies that know more than the government about what aspects of our personal information they even have, and about how they can best protect it? I don't have a solution, but I think we should be having that discussion. And we can’t have it until social media companies are ready to talk."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

Two factors have been the focus of repeated discussion - fake news and targeting of ads. A Department of Culture, Media and Sport select committee has recently been taking evidence about the first of these. But reports in The Guardian and The Observer over the weekend of 18th and 19th March have brought the second activity into its fresh focus.","According to a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie, the company did collect data on Facebook users and use it to target political ads, despite the denials made by its founder, Alexander Nix, including during evidence given to the DCMS committee in February.","Facebook has responded by suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambrdge Analytica, and Wylie. It has denied that the incident constitutes a data breach, states that data subjects gave their consent and that it was an academic researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, who violated the terms of a license under which he was given permission to run an app on Facebook by sharing the data collected. DCMS has announced that it will call back Nix and Facebook to explain their earlier statements that no personal information was involved in this activity.","What has happened to the Facebook data?","Kogan applied for and was granted a license to operate an app, thisisyourdigitallife, on Facebook. Users were asked to take a personality test whose purpose was to capture likes as part of a psychographic modelling exercise to identify how predictive these are of other behaviours, such as political affiliation and voting intention. This type of exercise is a relatively common practice - it underpins The University of Cambridge Psychometic Centre’s Magic Sauce profiling system, for example - because of the scale of Facebook’s user base and the visibility it provides into preferences.","Some 270,000 Facebook users downloaded the app. As part of the data collection it involved, their friends who had privacy settings that allowed for data sharing were also included in a data set said to involve up to 50 million individuals. Wylie alleges that the raw data from this app was passed by Kogan to Cambridge Analytica, in breach of the license he was granted.","Facebook was aware of this in 2015 and demanded that all copies be destroyed. In the wake of the DCMS hearing, the incident has gained fresh momentum and new questions are being asked about who knew about the data sharing, when it happened and whether the personal information involved was actually used and subsequently deleted.","What does the Data Protection Act say about this?","Cambridge Analytica is a UK-based company which has brought the Information Commissioner’s Office into the picture. Crucially, much will depend on whether any UK citizen’s data is involved. Given the global footprint of Facebook, even if the app was aimed at US voters, it is possible that some of the data covers British subjects, potentially as friends of those direct downloaders.","If this is the case, then any data collected is covered by the existing Data Protection Act. Two key principles are involved:","Use for a limited, specifically-stated purpose: The ICO will want to be satisfied that any UK citizens who downloaded the app were made aware of the purpose for which it would be used. If the data collection notice only mentioned academic research and not political profiling or data sharing, this would be a breach of the DPA. Facebook states that data sharing was not part of the terms and conditons of the license it granted.","Protection of sensitive information, such as political opinions: Any information that is potentially senstive, such as a user’s political opinions, has to meet high standards for the basis on which it will be processed. An academic researcher could claim legitimate interest provided they meet strict conditions - any additonal usage would require consent. Facebook says users of the thisisyourdigitallife app provided this.","What would happen under the General Data Protection Regulation?","As the app was launched in 2015, it is covered by the DPA. But if it were to be in use after 25th May of this year, then GDPR would apply. Transparency, definiton of purpose and granularity of consent are all much tougher under the Regulation. The distinction between data controllers and data processors is also less, which would play an important part in any investigation into who directly accessed and controlled app data, including whether Facebook was a first-party controller. Penalties for breaches of GDPR are substantial - sharing personal information and using it beyond the stated purpose would be likely to incur a €20 million or 4% of global turnover fine.","Why does this matter?","There are three critical dimensions to the Cambridge Analytica data issue. The first is for UK data subjects who may have had their sensitive personal information shared without their consent. The ICO will focus on establishing this in order to decide whether it has jurisdiction.","The second is for the fake news investigation being carried out by DCMS (which the ICO has alsos been asked to engage with). It is recalling Nix and Facebook to challenge evidence they provided in February about personal information sharing by Kogan with Cambridge Analytica. With Facebook now stating it knew this had happened back in 2015, it is likely to come under significant pressure about subsequent statements.","But there is a third group that needs to take a close look at its data collection practices, including consent notices and data sharing. Competitions, quizzes and games are common techniques deployed by affiliates as data capture mechanisms. In 2015, the ICO wrote to 1,000 companies in this sector asking about the basis for their data processing. In the wake of this weekend’s Cambridge Analytica revelations, it may just decide to take another look."],"isopubdate":""}

In order to leverage the deep pool of data Facebook collects on users, the company mixes information that it obtains from users themselves (Pages a user liked, for instance) with information from advertisers (membership status in a loyalty program, for example) and with data obtained from third party providers.","While Facebook feels comfortable with the integrity of its data sourcing within the first two categories, it feels less settled about dipping into these aggregate pools of third party data. The decision was issued in light of the company’s recent privacy concerns over third-party data mishandling.","Facebook Product Marketing Director Graham Mudd elaborated on the decision in a statement:","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Facebook clarified that it will still work with companies like Experian and Acxiom in order to measure ad performance and provide metrics, although it will also be conducting a review of those ongoing relationships. Facebook may also move toward sharing data in a shared server environment in order to offer further assurances of user privacy. As Mudd noted, the program will be discontinued in the coming months.","FREE BONUS SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD!** Includes Giveaway Rights **","Brought To You By Profit Agency","Free Downloads","Click The Image To Download","Products & Reviews:","The key purpose is to sponsor brands through various types of digital media.

Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.","Facebook and its rivals, including Twitter and YouTube, have largely withstood political pressure stemming from Russia's manipulation of their services. While they have taken voluntary steps to restrict foreign interference and combat false news, they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes, and legislation on the issue has stalled.","It was not clear whether Republicans who hold congressional committee gavels would announce hearings related to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.

Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, a data-analysis firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, over allegations that it held onto improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had deleted the information.","(Matt Rourke / AP)","Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Tom HamburgerWashington Post","Facebook's recent suspension of Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that played a key role in President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, highlights the rapid rise of a company that claimed it had reached new heights in marrying the art of political persuasion with the science of big data.","Four years after the company began offering Republican political candidates the promise of groundbreaking tools for delivering political messages tailored to the psychological traits of voters, serious questions remain about its tactics and effectiveness.","What is clear is that the services Cambridge Analytica offered are increasingly coveted by modern political campaigns. Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information - including the names of users, their \"likes,\" friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work - including a former Cambridge Analytica employee - said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","Facebook is suspending the Trump -affiliated data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, after learning that it failed to delete data that it had taken inappropriately from users of the social network, Facebook said late Friday.","Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication...","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what \"like\" buttons they had hit.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook's concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump's digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook's public website.","Some critics said Facebook's actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Cambridge Analytica - which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president's former senior adviser Stephen Bannon - has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its \"psychometric profiles\" could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company's actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, D, said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data \"may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. \"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 EU referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook's processes for dealing with developers who broke the company's rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules - usually because of a story in the news - the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook \"relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,\" Parakilas said. \"During my 16 months at the company, I don't recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.\"","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","\"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook's actions on Saturday, including if they ran afoul of their 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of their agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry in to U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge's \"psychographic targeting\" techniques - including its use of Facebook data - with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of the Cambridge work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge's work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm's data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign's data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump's strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge's parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in \"soft power,\" or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia's influence in the region.","SCL's main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience's values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of \"persuadables,\" and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL's defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company's techniques is that it \"can be undertaken covertly.\"","\"Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government's role and/or third parties can be invisible,\" he wrote."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Did the first president really say that?","Would George Washington have been an ally to modern-day gun-rights groups? A social-media meme suggests that he would have.","Around the time of Washington’s 282nd birthday, a reader sent us the meme, which includes a painting of Washington and a quote purportedly written or uttered by the nation’s first president: \"When government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern.\"","But are those really Washington’s words?","We contacted Edward Lengel, editor in chief of the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia. He said \"there is no evidence that Washington ever wrote or said these words, or any like them.\" Lengel cautioned that it’s impossible to prove a negative, but he added that he’s \"as certain as he can be\" that the quote did not originate from George Washington.","This is not the first time a similar claim has popped onto our radar screen.","In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated False a claim made two days after the Newtown elementary school shooting. When U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, appeared on Fox News Sunday, he was asked why he believed ordinary Americans should be able to buy semi-automatic weapons designed for military use. Gohmert answered in part, \"For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government.\"","The closest statement they could find was one Washington made in his first State of the Union address on Jan. 8, 1790: \"A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.\"","The academic consensus is that Washington was referring to a trained militia to defend the new nation, rather than anticipating citizens seeking to head off perceived governmental tyranny.","Ron Chernow, whose Washington: A Life won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for biography, told PolitiFact Texas that Washington was \"talking about national defense policy, not individuals arming themselves, and the need for national self-sufficiency in creating military supplies.\"","Some post-Revolutionary lawmakers did expect citizens to own firearms, but Washington does not appear to have been among them, experts said.","\"The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington,\" Lengel told PolitiFact Texas. \"Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors.

Here's How You Can View It | IFLScience","text":["Facebook Has A \"Secret File\" On You. Here's How You Can View It","Ever wondered what information Facebook is keeping about you? Well, it’s pretty easy to discover – but you might not like what you find (dun dun duuun!).","Facebook stores a lot of information about you, including previous images, adverts you’ve clicked on, conversations, documents shared on Messenger, and much more. It’s not alone in doing this, mind. Google, for example, keeps pretty close tabs on you.","So Nick Whigham, a reporter for the New Zealand Herald, decided to find out just how much Facebook knew about him. He was surprised to find out it had collected a huge amount data, some of which he didn’t even know existed.","“It included scanned copies of lease forms from a previous rental property I must've sent to my buddies over Messenger, my current tenant ledger report, an old monthly billing statement for my home broadband, screenshots of banking transfers and seemingly endless web pages of all the banal conversations I have ever had on the platform,” he wrote.","“It's an odd feeling to think that, in some ways, Facebook knows you better than you know yourself.”","The site also stores facial recognition data, names and numbers from your contact list, where you’ve been on the Internet, and much more.","You can find out the cache of data Facebook has on you pretty easily. All you need to do is click the small “down” triangle in the top-right corner of any Facebook page. From here, click Settings, then go to the General tab and click “Download a copy of your Facebook data” at the bottom. After up to an hour or so, you'll get an email telling you your data is ready to download.","Facebook has argued previously that it does this – openly, mind, not in secret – to keep the platform free. Some might be comfortable with that, some not.","“We work with third-party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or who use advertising or related products, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world,” Facebook notes in their data policy.","Whether you're willing to hand over the keys to your life to Mark Zuckerberg in order to keep it free, well, that's up to you."],"isopubdate":""}

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board.","The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","Tony Romm contributed to this report.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

I swear it’s not a case of getting early adopter syndrome. Trust me, given my background in subculture theory, I have workshopped that one.","It’s complicated and potentially long-winded, so in a nutshell, I have both professional and personal reasons.","1. Facebook is an excellent example of worst practice in almost every aspect of how to run and manage an online social network, and as someone who ostensibly believes there are good and bad ways to do those things, I don’t want to be part of it anymore.","2. Too many worlds colliding, too many invites to vampire garden pirate fishtank zombie kissing applications, and yes, I ended up with kind of too many friends from too many different spheres of my existence (not that I don’t love them all, really) for it to be non-complicated and fun.","Which is fine, and mostly my own fault, I can just log in less frequently, right? Apart from all the obvious problems with that (ignoring friend’s requests and messages and birthdays?), when I started toying with the idea of leaving I had this thought: “Sigh. I can’t leave. Everyone I know is on there and increasingly organising events through the events application, and…”","Whoa, what? I CAN’T LEAVE a commercial service that I never thought was super awesome in the first place and now I’m sick of BECAUSE MY SOCIAL WORLD IS STARTING TO DEPEND ON IT???","Right.","So the only way to reclaim my capacity to act is to engage in the politics of refusal, which I usually think of as pretty much an expression of impotence. Which makes me even more angry.","OK, so to be a bit more rational, here are just a few of the areas in which Facebook takes the prize for worst practice.","3. Almost every means at the user’s disposal to make their experience of the site safer, more socially comfortable, and less irritating (turning off notifications, making certain content visible to certain friends, making your profile invisible to Google searches, etc) requires effort and knowledge on the user’s behalf. Which is one among many symptoms of utter contempt for the users. See 4.","4. Did I mention the Terms of Use?","5. Oh, and even though Tom Hodgkinson clearly doesn’t respect the unwashed masses any more than the company does and generally thinks the interwebs are a waste of time, according to him it might also be run by an evil neoconservative conspiracy. Which would explain 1, 2, 3, and 4, and gives me little hope that user activism will ever make a bit of difference.","Anyway, there’s always a straw that broke the camel’s back. In my case, it came when an older member of my close family rang me for info and advice about how to ‘get onto’ Facebook, because other family members were sharing photos and news there, which anyone not using Facebook was missing out on.","The longer I talked about what people use Facebook for, and how to manage friends and privacy and tried to answer questions about why Facebook needed your date of birth, and whether ‘they’d send all kinds of junk emails’, the more uneasy I felt. It wasn’t anything like the many, many ‘how to use email’ or ‘what you can do with the Internet’ or ‘how to edit your digital photos’ conversations I’d had with family members and older friends and acquaintances before. So that’s when I started thinking about leaving.","Oh, and by the way, in order to delete your Facebook account, apparently, you have to not only deactivate it, but also delete every single item you have contributed to the site (messages, wall posts, posts other people have written on your wall, photos, links to contacts, profile information) and then email customer service and request they delete your account completely. Oh, and also, in order to delete absolutely everything, I’d also have to re-add every single one of the applications I’ve ever had installed, and then go through and remove the content, and then delete the applications again. Because when you delete an application, guess what? Your data is still stored there somewhere.","That’s not just meanness, but I’m pretty sure it’s also not just to be helpful in case you’re quitting in a fit of pique like this one and might decide later that you want to come back. It’s also because of the way the business model works: Facebook and all the marketeers who sail in her pretty much just want you to visit as many ad-bearing pages per visit as possible (that’s what all those applications and invites are for), and having lost your eyeballs, they’d quite like to keep the data that can be mined from those activities. So they’re going to make it as difficult as possible to scrub that data out of the system. Can you guess how much that softens my heart toward the company?","This is all very obvious of course, and absolutely non-unique, I know that. It’s just I’m not willing to put up with it anymore in this particular case.","So off I go digging little tiny pieces of content out of my account until it’s all clean again. It will be gone by this time tomorrow.","Good move! I have not left Facebook – I just began to ignore it. I have switched off all the notification emails and let it evolve without me. Its a bit like ignoring the work that needs to be done in a garden… Eventually the neighbors will begin to accept that you don’t take care of it…","I am glad you posted this entry. I’m in the long, excruiating process of deleting my facebook account and I feel much better knowing others are resisting the giant that is taking over the public sphere.","Interesting to read this Jean. I’ve been having the same feelings, amplified since the Hodgkinson piece, although I didn’t know how hard it was to leave. I’ve been looking around at alternative socialnetworking sites (mugshot, pulse, elgg, ning, peopleaggregator, mulitply … ). It’s difficult to evaluate – and of course then there’s the problem of whether all your friends will come too. Then again, this has always been a problem with social networking. It’s like changing pubs. Never easy but sometimes necessary.","The counter-intuitiveness, and the data mining, really piss me off, but I think the worst thing is that Facebook covers the territory where I used to think people would create their own independent networks. It’s all about social exclusivity, and fear of missing out. Yay for deletion.","Katy, do you still really use snail mail? I’ve been promising a few people in particular actual written letters for a while. It’s something I really miss doing! Maybe I’ll get round to it soon after all.","Anne – cool! The course looks great btw.","Andrew, if you could see QUT’s local you’d realise how accurate your metaphor is!!! I’m not trying to get people to follow me (and I fully expect everyone else will carry on Facebooking without me). My friends all know where to find me anyway; I’m not sure my social life will be destroyed by this wanton act of destruction. BTW, the wanton destruction side of it was kind of pleasurable. That’s why mere deactivation just wouldn’t do.","And Az, I hear you re: independent networks, but of course creating and maintaining those creates a certain level of enterprise and a certain set of technological competencies that Facebook helps you to bypass (which is part of the reason for the mass take-up). And there’s the tension, right there.","Great rant. I started benignly neglecting my profile at the start of the year, and haven’t really looked back. I’m finding myself still contacting the people I’d usually contact via e-mail anyway, and everything else just becomes too distracting and/or annoying. The insane difficulty of deleting your account just confirms all that you’ve been feeling.","I wonder: will we all look back at Web 2.0ishness in a decade or so and wonder WTF we were all thinking handing over our data and desires just like that?","hi jean jean\nI have something to confess. I am not on Facebook. I have never even looked at Facebook. (The whole thing gives me a big headache.) Reading your rant though, its funny hearing the elements of addiction (I HAVE to be on it, or something bad will happen) that probably perpetuate sites like this – but maybe also wear people out in the end?\nI was thinking of having a look at Facebook…but you’ve changed my mind. Thankyou!!! (love you maaaaaate)","Actually I joined Facebook because of my brothers who joined…Well, i must have been in my “5 minutes” because I didn’t do any reasearch about that site….embarrassing because I’m an IT guy and normally do some research ………….\nAnyway…wished I would’ve read your blog earlier…\nYour writing is hilarious…","I can’t believe so many people are being THIS bothered by this. I think the fact that people are driven to madness and have to actually delete their cute little facebook account for resolve is, in itself, creepy.","I have a facebook account. I have a lot of friends on facebook. That’s it. Nothing else… No Lawnmower Man, no Matrix, no evil blood in the wires… just another internet site.","It mirrors my sentiments and I just went through and deleted my facebook too.","The people that cant understand or think facebook is just one more site really need to think about the bigger issues.","1. The lock in is a big deal. It’s very hard to get all of your data out of facebook (messages, photos, friends email addresses). Which means people are more likely to stay.. The other aspect to lockin is that face that facebook does not conform to the opensocial api etc means that you’ll stay on the site because your friends are on the site..","Lets face it, it IS fun to see what your friends have been upto and also post a few pics of some family event to update people.. But the problem lies in the fact that they have such a tight lockin it’s near impossible to get away from it all and still keep as updated with your friends.","2. The dubious origins facebook.. ie. stolen source code from the guy that originally came up with the idea (the connectu.com guys).","It’s not about addiction.. I hardly log onto my facebook account, maybe once every few weeks.. but it’s just the ever growing beast that locks you in tighter and tighter widening its monopoly without having to do anything.","It’s also an abomination of a site, it’s bloated, slow, full of spammy apps, and generally horrid.","And then there’s the lack of privacy and contact partitioning that means anyone that knows your name can request to get onto your friends list.. which is fine if there was adequate privacy and partitioning settings.. but there’s not, which means it’s a constant fight adding people and worrying about group convergence.. Do you really want your neighbour, mother, supervisor, best friend, and guy you met at some conference all knowing the same things about you.. (bad enough) but even worse… knowing everything about each other without even being friends.","Facebook access you webmail contact list like google, yahoo, hotmail,etc without your permission and use it to generate the suggestions friend list. I am seeing people that I never met before or ex-coworkers from 5 years ago. This is an unethical practice and it’s illegal. They are evil and they only care about you personal data. I can see this company selling your data in the black market in the near future.","jen… Don’t be scared to sign up under a bogus name so you can have a look. You can use Facebook to check up on people you work with or you employer. Or a potential boyfriend or a crush. Be careful with that though. I’ve found that people I may secretly admire or like, once I’ve seen their profile or parts of it I realise there is no way we are compatible. But that crush feeling is still there. So Facebook kinda sux like that. Personally I’d rather get to know someone over a romantic dinner than peruse their (me and 4000 other people) Facebook profile. I dunno, I think things like Facebook kill all the romance and mystery of life.","oh and Mike… Why don’t you tell me you Facebook id number and I’ll show you exactly what I can do with it.","This place was actually decent when they had standards and college students were on it. Now, it’s full of 10-11 year olds who want attention and 50-60 year olds. Disgusting & annoying. Most people who are on it now are not even aware that it’s been around for a while! Now it’s just another useless fad for old people and children who want attention.","blah blah, you’ll be old some day and your kids will be saying the same thing about you as you join the next social networking wave to keep in touch with family and friends left behind. You might even want to look at a few photos of your grandkids, so don’t be insulted when some young punk writes a comment like yours and says ‘get lost, you old fart. You’re not wanted here.’","I completely agree. I felt the same weird “Oh no, I’m going to lose touch” and yet, how LAME. When I sell a book, let some other hourly worker (perhaps some of your haters) be my “social media connection” and post for me since I’m too old and unhip and 40 to want to deal with this crap. THANK YOU for saying it better than I could. If I were still on FB, I’d ask to be your “Friend” and send you a virtual bouquet of flowers.","I’ve turned a blind eye to facebook’s issues in the past but in the last month, I’ve had 2 issues. Firstly, one day i noticed that all my interests and activities were visible to everyone. And then today, i noticed that the supposed “new and improved” privacy handles actually compromised my Privacy. I had set certain groups to be unable to view status updates and wall posts – however, today they all can see it. I’ve taken time to create relevant groups for relevant posts – i am NOT a silly user but this just really angered me.","I am supposedly being street smart , but still getting fooled by FB. I will be deleting my account as well. Wish i did the smart thing like you did and got it done 2 years ago.","It’s so true! I literally became paranoid when a relative of mine left facebook. To not see him listed under my “Friend” section suddenly had me thnking he has deleted “himself” from my page. Immediately my mind started wondering in a panic over “what I had said or wrote that offended him”. Was the mob after him? a baby momma? was he dead? in jail? Irs after him? But then I understand why some get rid of FB. To constantly see two FB pals talking to each other and continually ignoring you, make you wonder if they only signed you on so you won’t “be offended”.

A missing left arm, to be exact, severed at the shoulder, temporarily patched and held together.  Thick, pale flesh, flecked with bright red at the edges. It looked like meat sliced open. The face and what remained of the rest of the man were obscured by blankets, an American flag quilt, and a jumble of tubes and tape, wires, drip bags, and medical monitors.  That man and two other critically wounded soldiers — one with two stumps where legs had been, the other missing a leg below the thigh — were intubated, unconscious, and lying on stretchers hooked to the walls of the plane that had just landed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. A tattoo on the soldier’s remaining arm read, “DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR.”  I asked a member of the Air Force medical team about the casualties they see like these. Many, as with this flight, were coming from Afghanistan, he told me. “A lot from the Horn of Africa,” he added. “You don’t really hear about that in the media.”  “Where in Africa?” I asked.  He said he didn’t know exactly, but generally from the Horn, often with critical injuries. “A lot out of Djibouti,” he added, referring to Camp Lemonnier, the main U.S. military base in Africa, but from “elsewhere” in the region, too.  Since the “Black Hawk Down” deaths in Somalia almost 20 years ago, we’ve heard little, if anything, about American military casualties in Africa (other than a strange report last week about three special operations commandos killed, along with three women identified by U.S. military sources as “Moroccan prostitutes,” in a mysterious car accident in Mali). The growing number of patients arriving at Ramstein from Africa pulls back a curtain on a significant transformation in twenty-first-century U.S. military strategy.  These casualties are likely to be the vanguard of growing numbers of wounded troops coming from places far removed from Afghanistan or Iraq. They reflect the increased use of relatively small bases like Camp Lemonnier, which military planners see as a model for future U.S. bases “scattered,” as one academic explains, “across regions in which the United States has previously not maintained a military presence.”  Disappearing are the days when Ramstein was the signature U.S. base, an American-town-sized behemoth filled with thousands or tens of thousands of Americans, PXs, Pizza Huts, and other amenities of home. But don’t for a second think that the Pentagon is packing up, downsizing its global mission, and heading home. In fact, based on developments in recent years, the opposite may be true. While the collection of Cold War-era giant bases around the world is shrinking, the global infrastructure of bases overseas has exploded in size and scope.  Unknown to most Americans, Washington’s garrisoning of the planet is on the rise, thanks to a new generation of bases the military calls “lily pads” (as in a frog jumping across a pond toward its prey). These are small, secretive, inaccessible facilities with limited numbers of troops, spartan amenities, and prepositioned weaponry and supplies.  Around the world, from Djibouti to the jungles of Honduras, the deserts of Mauritania to Australia’s tiny Cocos Islands, the Pentagon has been pursuing as many lily pads as it can, in as many countries as it can, as fast as it can. Although statistics are hard to assemble, given the often-secretive nature of such bases, the Pentagon has probably built upwards of 50 lily pads and other small bases since around 2000, while exploring the construction of dozens more.  As Mark Gillem, author of America Town: Building the Outposts of Empire, explains, “avoidance” of local populations, publicity, and potential opposition is the new aim. “To project its power,” he says, the United States wants “secluded and self-contained outposts strategically located” around the world. According to some of the strategy’s strongest proponents at the American Enterprise Institute, the goal should be “to create a worldwide network of frontier forts,” with the U.S. military “the ‘global cavalry’ of the twenty-first century.”  Such lily-pad bases have become a critical part of an evolving Washington military strategy aimed at maintaining U.S. global dominance by doing far more with less in an increasingly competitive, ever more multi-polar world. Central as it’s becoming to the long-term U.S. stance, this global-basing reset policy has, remarkably enough, received almost no public attention, nor significant Congressional oversight. Meanwhile, as the arrival of the first casualties from Africa shows, the U.S. military is getting involved in new areas of the world and new conflicts, with potentially disastrous consequences.  Transforming the Base Empire  You might think that the U.S. military is in the process of shrinking, rather than expanding, its little noticed but enormous collection of bases abroad. After all, it was forced to close the full panoply of 505 bases, mega to micro, that it built in Iraq, and it’s now beginning the process of drawing down forces in Afghanistan. In Europe, the Pentagon is continuing to close its massive bases in Germany and will soon remove two combat brigades from that country. Global troop numbers are set to shrink by around 100,000.  Yet Washington still easily maintains the largest collection of foreign bases in world history: more than 1,000 military installations outside the 50 states and Washington, DC. They include everything from decades-old bases in Germany and Japan to brand-new drone bases in Ethiopia and the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean and even resorts for military vacationers in Italy and South Korea.  In Afghanistan, the U.S.-led international force still occupies more than 450 bases. In total, the U.S. military has some form of troop presence in approximately 150 foreign countries, not to mention 11 aircraft carrier task forces — essentially floating bases — and a significant, and growing, military presence in space. The United States currently spends an estimated $250 billion annually maintaining bases and troops overseas.  Some bases, like Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, date to the late nineteenth century. Most were built or occupied during or just after World War II on every continent, including Antarctica. Although the U.S. military vacated around 60% of its foreign bases following the Soviet Union’s collapse, the Cold War base infrastructure remained relatively intact, with 60,000 American troops remaining in Germany alone, despite the absence of a superpower adversary.  However, in the early months of 2001, even before the attacks of 9/11, the Bush administration launched a major global realignment of bases and troops that’s continuing today with Obama’s “Asia pivot.” Bush’s original plan was to close more than one-third of the nation’s overseas bases and shift troops east and south, closer to predicted conflict zones in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Pentagon began to focus on creating smaller and more flexible “forward operating bases” and even smaller “cooperative security locations” or “lily pads.” Major troop concentrations were to be restricted to a reduced number of “main operating bases” (MOBs) — like Ramstein, Guam in the Pacific, and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean — which were to be expanded.  Despite the rhetoric of consolidation and closure that went with this plan, in the post-9/11 era the Pentagon has actually been expanding its base infrastructure dramatically, including dozens of major bases in every Persian Gulf country save Iran, and in several Central Asian countries critical to the war in Afghanistan.   Hitting the Base Reset Button  Obama’s recently announced “Asia pivot” signals that East Asia will be at the center of the explosion of lily-pad bases and related developments. Already in Australia, U.S. marines are settling into a shared base in Darwin. Elsewhere, the Pentagon is pursuing plans for a drone and surveillance base in Australia’s Cocos Islands and deployments to Brisbane and Perth. In Thailand, the Pentagon has negotiated rights for new Navy port visits and a “disaster-relief hub” at U-Tapao.  In the Philippines, whose government evicted the U.S. from the massive Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base in the early 1990s, as many as 600 special forces troops have quietly been operating in the country’s south since January 2002. Last month, the two governments reached an agreement on the future U.S. use of Clark and Subic, as well as other repair and supply hubs from the Vietnam War era. In a sign of changing times, U.S. officials even signed a 2011 defense agreement with former enemy Vietnam and have begun negotiations over the Navy’s increased use of Vietnamese ports.  Elsewhere in Asia, the Pentagon has rebuilt a runway on tiny Tinian island near Guam, and it’s considering future bases in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei, while pushing stronger military ties with India. Every year in the region, the military conducts around 170 military exercises and 250 port visits. On South Korea’s Jeju island, the Korean military is building a base that will be part of the U.S. missile defense system and to which U.S. forces will have regular access.  “We just can’t be in one place to do what we’ve got to do,” Pacific Command commander Admiral Samuel Locklear III has said. For military planners, “what we’ve got to do” is clearly defined as isolating and (in the terminology of the Cold War) “containing” the new power in the region, China. This evidently means “peppering” new bases throughout the region, adding to the more than 200 U.S. bases that have encircled China for decades in Japan, South Korea, Guam, and Hawaii.  And Asia is just the beginning. In Africa, the Pentagon has quietly created “about a dozen air bases” for drones and surveillance since 2007. In addition to Camp Lemonnier, we know that the military has created or will soon create installations in Burkina Faso, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritania, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Seychelles, South Sudan, and Uganda. The Pentagon has also investigated building bases in Algeria, Gabon, Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria, among other places.  Next year, a brigade-sized force of 3,000 troops, and “likely more,” will arrive for exercises and training missions across the continent. In the nearby Persian Gulf, the Navy is developing an “afloat forward-staging base,” or “mothership,” to serve as a sea-borne “lily pad” for helicopters and patrol craft, and has been involved in a massive build-up of forces in the region.  In Latin America, following the military’s eviction from Panama in 1999 and Ecuador in 2009, the Pentagon has created or upgraded new bases in Aruba and Curaçao, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, and Peru.  Elsewhere, the Pentagon has funded the creation of military and police bases capable of hosting U.S. forces in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, and even Ecuador. In 2008, the Navy reactivated its Fourth Fleet, inactive since 1950, to patrol the region. The military may want a base in Brazil and unsuccessfully tried to create bases, ostensibly for humanitarian and emergency relief, in Paraguay and Argentina.  Finally, in Europe, after arriving in the Balkans during 1990’s interventions, U.S. bases have moved eastward into some of the former Eastern Bloc states of the Soviet empire. The Pentagon is now developing installations capable of supporting rotating, brigade-sized deployments in Romania and Bulgaria, and a missile defense base and aviation facilities in Poland. Previously, the Bush administration maintained two CIA black sites (secret prisons) in Lithuania and another in Poland. Citizens of the Czech Republic rejected a planned radar base for the Pentagon’s still unproven missile defense system, and now Romania will host ground-based missiles.  A New American Way of War  A lily pad on one of the Gulf of Guinea islands of S­ão Tomé and Príncipe, off the oil-rich west coast of Africa, helps explain what’s going on. A U.S. official has described the base as “another Diego Garcia,” referring to the Indian Ocean base that’s helped ensure decades of U.S. domination over Middle Eastern energy supplies. Without the freedom to create new large bases in Africa, the Pentagon is using S­ão Tomé and a growing collection of other lily pads on the continent in an attempt to control another crucial oil-rich region.  Far beyond West Africa, the nineteenth century “Great Game” competition for Central Asia has returned with a passion — and this time gone global.  It’s spreading to resource-rich lands in Africa, Asia, and South America, as the United States, China, Russia, and members of the European Union find themselves locked in an increasingly intense competition for economic and geopolitical supremacy.  While Beijing, in particular, has pursued this competition in a largely economic fashion, dotting the globe with strategic investments, Washington has focused relentlessly on military might as its global trump card, dotting the planet with new bases and other forms of military power. “Forget full-scale invasions and large-footprint occupations on the Eurasian mainland,” Nick Turse has written of this new twenty-first century military strategy. “Instead, think: special operations forces... proxy armies... the militarization of spying and intelligence... drone aircraft... cyber-attacks, and joint Pentagon operations with increasingly militarized ‘civilian’ government agencies.”  Add to this unparalleled long-range air and naval power; arms sales besting any nation on Earth; humanitarian and disaster relief missions that clearly serve military intelligence, patrol, and “hearts and minds” functions; the rotational deployment of regular U.S. forces globally; port visits and an expanding array of joint military exercises and training missions that give the U.S. military de facto “presence” worldwide and help turn foreign militaries into proxy forces.  And lots and lots of lily-pad bases.  Military planners see a future of endless small-scale interventions in which a large, geographically dispersed collection of bases will always be primed for instant operational access. With bases in as many places as possible, military planners want to be able to turn to another conveniently close country if the United States is ever prevented from using a base, as it was by Turkey prior to the invasion of Iraq. In other words, Pentagon officials dream of nearly limitless flexibility, the ability to react with remarkable rapidity to developments anywhere on Earth, and thus, something approaching total military control over the planet.  Beyond their military utility, the lily pads and other forms of power projection are also political and economic tools used to build and maintain alliances and provide privileged U.S. access to overseas markets, resources, and investment opportunities. Washington is planning to use lily-pad bases and other military projects to bind countries in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America as closely as possible to the U.S. military — and so to continued U.S. political-economic hegemony. In short, American officials are hoping military might will entrench their influence and keep as many countries as possible within an American orbit at a time when some are asserting their independence ever more forcefully or gravitating toward China and other rising powers.  Those Dangerous Lily Pads  While relying on smaller bases may sound smarter and more cost effective than maintaining huge bases that have often caused anger in places like Okinawa and South Korea, lily pads threaten U.S. and global security in several ways:  First, the “lily pad” language can be misleading, since by design or otherwise, such installations are capable of quickly growing into bloated behemoths.  Second, despite the rhetoric about spreading democracy that still lingers in Washington, building more lily pads actually guarantees collaboration with an increasing number of despotic, corrupt, and murderous regimes.  Third, there is a well-documented pattern of damage that military facilities of various sizes inflict on local communities. Although lily pads seem to promise insulation from local opposition, over time even small bases have often led to anger and protest movements.  Finally, a proliferation of lily pads means the creeping militarization of large swaths of the globe. Like real lily pads — which are actually aquatic weeds — bases have a way of growing and reproducing uncontrollably. Indeed, bases tend to beget bases, creating “base races” with other nations, heightening military tensions, and discouraging diplomatic solutions to conflicts. After all, how would the United States respond if China, Russia, or Iran were to build even a single lily-pad base of its own in Mexico or the Caribbean?  For China and Russia in particular, ever more U.S. bases near their borders threaten to set off new cold wars. Most troublingly, the creation of new bases to protect against an alleged future Chinese military threat may prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy: such bases in Asia are likely to create the threat they are supposedly designed to protect against, making a catastrophic war with China more, not less, likely.  Encouragingly, however, overseas bases have recently begun to generate critical scrutiny across the political spectrum from Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul to Democratic Senator Jon Tester and New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. With everyone looking for ways to trim the deficit, closing overseas bases offers easy savings. Indeed, increasingly influential types are recognizing that the country simply can’t afford more than 1,000 bases abroad.  Great Britain, like empires before it, had to close most of its remaining foreign bases in the midst of an economic crisis in the 1960s and 1970s. The United States is undoubtedly headed in that direction sooner or later. The only question is whether the country will give up its bases and downsize its global mission by choice, or if it will follow Britain’s path as a fading power forced to give up its bases from a position of weakness.  Of course, the consequences of not choosing another path extend beyond economics. If the proliferation of lily pads, special operations forces, and drone wars continues, the United States is likely to be drawn into new conflicts and new wars, generating unknown forms of blowback, and untold death and destruction. In that case, we’d better prepare for a lot more incoming flights — from the Horn of Africa to Honduras — carrying not just amputees but caskets.

A missing left arm, to be exact, severed at the shoulder, temporarily patched and held together. Thick, pale flesh, flecked with bright red at the edges. It looked like meat sliced open. The face and what remained of the rest of the man were obscured by blankets, an American flag quilt, and a jumble of tubes and tape, wires, drip bags, and medical monitors.","That man and two other critically wounded soldiers — one with two stumps where legs had been, the other missing a leg below the thigh — were intubated, unconscious, and lying on stretchers hooked to the walls of the plane that had just landed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. A tattoo on the soldier’s remaining arm read, “DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR.”","I asked a member of the Air Force medical team about the casualties they see like these. Many, as with this flight, were coming from Afghanistan, he told me. “A lot from the Horn of Africa,” he added. “You don’t really hear about that in the media.”","“Where in Africa?” I asked. He said he didn’t know exactly, but generally from the Horn, often with critical injuries. “A lot out of Djibouti,” he added, referring to Camp Lemonnier, the main U.S. military base in Africa, but from “elsewhere” in the region, too.","Since the “Black Hawk Down” deaths in Somalia almost 20 years ago, we’ve heard little, if anything, about American military casualties in Africa (other than a strange report last week about three special operations commandos killed, along with three women identified by U.S. military sources as “Moroccan prostitutes,” in a mysterious car accident in Mali). The growing number of patients arriving at Ramstein from Africa pulls back a curtain on a significant transformation in twenty-first-century U.S. military strategy.","These casualties are likely to be the vanguard of growing numbers of wounded troops coming from places far removed from Afghanistan or Iraq. They reflect the increased use of relatively small bases like Camp Lemonnier, which military planners see as a model for future U.S. bases “scattered,” as one academic explains, “across regions in which the United States has previously not maintained a military presence.”","Disappearing are the days when Ramstein was the signature U.S. base, an American-town-sized behemoth filled with thousands or tens of thousands of Americans, PXs, Pizza Huts, and other amenities of home. But don’t for a second think that the Pentagon is packing up, downsizing its global mission, and heading home. In fact, based on developments in recent years, the opposite may be true. While the collection of Cold War-era giant bases around the world is shrinking, the global infrastructure of bases overseas has exploded in size and scope.","Unknown to most Americans, Washington’s garrisoning of the planet is on the rise, thanks to a new generation of bases the military calls “lily pads” (as in a frog jumping across a pond toward its prey). These are small, secretive, inaccessible facilities with limited numbers of troops, spartan amenities, and prepositioned weaponry and supplies.","Around the world, from Djibouti to the jungles of Honduras, the deserts of Mauritania to Australia’s tiny Cocos Islands, the Pentagon has been pursuing as many lily pads as it can, in as many countries as it can, as fast as it can. Although statistics are hard to assemble, given the often-secretive nature of such bases, the Pentagon has probably built upwards of 50 lily pads and other small bases since around 2000, while exploring the construction of dozens more.","As Mark Gillem, author of America Town: Building the Outposts of Empire, explains, “avoidance” of local populations, publicity, and potential opposition is the new aim. “To project its power,” he says, the United States wants “secluded and self-contained outposts strategically located” around the world. According to some of the strategy’s strongest proponents at the American Enterprise Institute, the goal should be “to create a worldwide network of frontier forts,” with the U.S. military “the ‘global cavalry’ of the twenty-first century.”","Such lily-pad bases have become a critical part of an evolving Washington military strategy aimed at maintaining U.S. global dominance by doing far more with less in an increasingly competitive, ever more multi-polar world. Central as it’s becoming to the long-term U.S. stance, this global-basing reset policy has, remarkably enough, received almost no public attention, nor significant Congressional oversight. Meanwhile, as the arrival of the first casualties from Africa shows, the U.S. military is getting involved in new areas of the world and new conflicts, with potentially disastrous consequences.","Transforming the Base Empire","You might think that the U.S. military is in the process of shrinking, rather than expanding, its little noticed but enormous collection of bases abroad. After all, it was forced to close the full panoply of 505 bases, mega to micro, that it built in Iraq, and it’s now beginning the process of drawing down forces in Afghanistan. In Europe, the Pentagon is continuing to close its massive bases in Germany and will soon remove two combat brigades from that country. Global troop numbers are set to shrink by around 100,000.","Yet Washington still easily maintains the largest collection of foreign bases in world history: more than 1,000 military installations outside the 50 states and Washington, DC. They include everything from decades-old bases in Germany and Japan to brand-new drone bases in Ethiopia and the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean and even resorts for military vacationers in Italy and South Korea.","In Afghanistan, the U.S.-led international force still occupies more than 450 bases. In total, the U.S. military has some form of troop presence in approximately 150 foreign countries, not to mention 11 aircraft carrier task forces — essentially floating bases — and a significant, and growing, military presence in space. The United States currently spends an estimated $250 billion annually maintaining bases and troops overseas.","Some bases, like Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, date to the late nineteenth century. Most were built or occupied during or just after World War II on every continent, including Antarctica. Although the U.S. military vacated around 60% of its foreign bases following the Soviet Union’s collapse, the Cold War base infrastructure remained relatively intact, with 60,000 American troops remaining in Germany alone, despite the absence of a superpower adversary.","However, in the early months of 2001, even before the attacks of 9/11, the Bush administration launched a major global realignment of bases and troops that’s continuing today with Obama’s “Asia pivot.” Bush’s original plan was to close more than one-third of the nation’s overseas bases and shift troops east and south, closer to predicted conflict zones in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Pentagon began to focus on creating smaller and more flexible “forward operating bases” and even smaller “cooperative security locations” or “lily pads.” Major troop concentrations were to be restricted to a reduced number of “main operating bases” (MOBs) — like Ramstein, Guam in the Pacific, and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean — which were to be expanded.","Despite the rhetoric of consolidation and closure that went with this plan, in the post-9/11 era the Pentagon has actually been expanding its base infrastructure dramatically, including dozens of major bases in every Persian Gulf country save Iran, and in several Central Asian countries critical to the war in Afghanistan.","Hitting the Base Reset Button","Obama’s recently announced “Asia pivot” signals that East Asia will be at the center of the explosion of lily-pad bases and related developments. Already in Australia, U.S. marines are settling into a shared base in Darwin. Elsewhere, the Pentagon is pursuing plans for a drone and surveillance base in Australia’s Cocos Islands and deployments to Brisbane and Perth. In Thailand, the Pentagon has negotiated rights for new Navy port visits and a “disaster-relief hub” at U-Tapao.","In the Philippines, whose government evicted the U.S. from the massive Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base in the early 1990s, as many as 600 special forces troops have quietly been operating in the country’s south since January 2002. Last month, the two governments reached an agreement on the future U.S. use of Clark and Subic, as well as other repair and supply hubs from the Vietnam War era. In a sign of changing times, U.S. officials even signed a 2011 defense agreement with former enemy Vietnam and have begun negotiations over the Navy’s increased use of Vietnamese ports.","Elsewhere in Asia, the Pentagon has rebuilt a runway on tiny Tinian island near Guam, and it’s considering future bases in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei, while pushing stronger military ties with India. Every year in the region, the military conducts around 170 military exercises and 250 port visits. On South Korea’s Jeju island, the Korean military is building a base that will be part of the U.S. missile defense system and to which U.S. forces will have regular access.","“We just can’t be in one place to do what we’ve got to do,” Pacific Command commander Admiral Samuel Locklear III has said. For military planners, “what we’ve got to do” is clearly defined as isolating and (in the terminology of the Cold War) “containing” the new power in the region, China. This evidently means “peppering” new bases throughout the region, adding to the more than 200 U.S. bases that have encircled China for decades in Japan, South Korea, Guam, and Hawaii.","And Asia is just the beginning. In Africa, the Pentagon has quietly created “about a dozen air bases” for drones and surveillance since 2007. In addition to Camp Lemonnier, we know that the military has created or will soon create installations in Burkina Faso, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritania, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Seychelles, South Sudan, and Uganda. The Pentagon has also investigated building bases in Algeria, Gabon, Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria, among other places.","Next year, a brigade-sized force of 3,000 troops, and “likely more,” will arrive for exercises and training missions across the continent. In the nearby Persian Gulf, the Navy is developing an “afloat forward-staging base,” or “mothership,” to serve as a sea-borne “lily pad” for helicopters and patrol craft, and has been involved in a massive build-up of forces in the region.","In Latin America, following the military’s eviction from Panama in 1999 and Ecuador in 2009, the Pentagon has created or upgraded new bases in Aruba and Curaçao, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, and Peru. Elsewhere, the Pentagon has funded the creation of military and police bases capable of hosting U.S. forces in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, and even Ecuador. In 2008, the Navy reactivated its Fourth Fleet, inactive since 1950, to patrol the region. The military may want a base in Brazil and unsuccessfully tried to create bases, ostensibly for humanitarian and emergency relief, in Paraguay and Argentina.","Finally, in Europe, after arriving in the Balkans during 1990’s interventions, U.S. bases have moved eastward into some of the former Eastern Bloc states of the Soviet empire. The Pentagon is now developing installations capable of supporting rotating, brigade-sized deployments in Romania and Bulgaria, and a missile defense base and aviation facilities in Poland. Previously, the Bush administration maintained two CIA black sites (secret prisons) in Lithuania and another in Poland. Citizens of the Czech Republic rejected a planned radar base for the Pentagon’s still unproven missile defense system, and now Romania will host ground-based missiles.","A New American Way of War","A lily pad on one of the Gulf of Guinea islands of S­ão Tomé and Príncipe, off the oil-rich west coast of Africa, helps explain what’s going on. A U.S. official has described the base as “another Diego Garcia,” referring to the Indian Ocean base that’s helped ensure decades of U.S. domination over Middle Eastern energy supplies. Without the freedom to create new large bases in Africa, the Pentagon is using S­ão Tomé and a growing collection of other lily pads on the continent in an attempt to control another crucial oil-rich region.","Far beyond West Africa, the nineteenth century “Great Game” competition for Central Asia has returned with a passion — and this time gone global. It’s spreading to resource-rich lands in Africa, Asia, and South America, as the United States, China, Russia, and members of the European Union find themselves locked in an increasingly intense competition for economic and geopolitical supremacy.","While Beijing, in particular, has pursued this competition in a largely economic fashion, dotting the globe with strategic investments, Washington has focused relentlessly on military might as its global trump card, dotting the planet with new bases and other forms of military power. “Forget full-scale invasions and large-footprint occupations on the Eurasian mainland,” Nick Turse has written of this new twenty-first century military strategy. “Instead, think: special operations forces... proxy armies... the militarization of spying and intelligence... drone aircraft... cyber-attacks, and joint Pentagon operations with increasingly militarized ‘civilian’ government agencies.”","Add to this unparalleled long-range air and naval power; arms sales besting any nation on Earth; humanitarian and disaster relief missions that clearly serve military intelligence, patrol, and “hearts and minds” functions; the rotational deployment of regular U.S. forces globally; port visits and an expanding array of joint military exercises and training missions that give the U.S. military de facto “presence” worldwide and help turn foreign militaries into proxy forces.","And lots and lots of lily-pad bases.","Military planners see a future of endless small-scale interventions in which a large, geographically dispersed collection of bases will always be primed for instant operational access. With bases in as many places as possible, military planners want to be able to turn to another conveniently close country if the United States is ever prevented from using a base, as it was by Turkey prior to the invasion of Iraq. In other words, Pentagon officials dream of nearly limitless flexibility, the ability to react with remarkable rapidity to developments anywhere on Earth, and thus, something approaching total military control over the planet.","Beyond their military utility, the lily pads and other forms of power projection are also political and economic tools used to build and maintain alliances and provide privileged U.S. access to overseas markets, resources, and investment opportunities. Washington is planning to use lily-pad bases and other military projects to bind countries in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America as closely as possible to the U.S. military — and so to continued U.S. political-economic hegemony. In short, American officials are hoping military might will entrench their influence and keep as many countries as possible within an American orbit at a time when some are asserting their independence ever more forcefully or gravitating toward China and other rising powers.","Those Dangerous Lily Pads","While relying on smaller bases may sound smarter and more cost effective than maintaining huge bases that have often caused anger in places like Okinawa and South Korea, lily pads threaten U.S. and global security in several ways:","First, the “lily pad” language can be misleading, since by design or otherwise, such installations are capable of quickly growing into bloated behemoths.","Second, despite the rhetoric about spreading democracy that still lingers in Washington, building more lily pads actually guarantees collaboration with an increasing number of despotic, corrupt, and murderous regimes.","Third, there is a well-documented pattern of damage that military facilities of various sizes inflict on local communities. Although lily pads seem to promise insulation from local opposition, over time even small bases have often led to anger and protest movements.","Finally, a proliferation of lily pads means the creeping militarization of large swaths of the globe. Like real lily pads — which are actually aquatic weeds — bases have a way of growing and reproducing uncontrollably. Indeed, bases tend to beget bases, creating “base races” with other nations, heightening military tensions, and discouraging diplomatic solutions to conflicts. After all, how would the United States respond if China, Russia, or Iran were to build even a single lily-pad base of its own in Mexico or the Caribbean?","For China and Russia in particular, ever more U.S. bases near their borders threaten to set off new cold wars. Most troublingly, the creation of new bases to protect against an alleged future Chinese military threat may prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy: such bases in Asia are likely to create the threat they are supposedly designed to protect against, making a catastrophic war with China more, not less, likely.","Encouragingly, however, overseas bases have recently begun to generate critical scrutiny across the political spectrum from Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul to Democratic Senator Jon Tester and New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. With everyone looking for ways to trim the deficit, closing overseas bases offers easy savings. Indeed, increasingly influential types are recognizing that the country simply can’t afford more than 1,000 bases abroad.","Great Britain, like empires before it, had to close most of its remaining foreign bases in the midst of an economic crisis in the 1960s and 1970s.

Their stock has fallen over 10% in value, shareholders are suing them, and FTC may end up fining them over $2 trillion dollars for violating consent decrees. $40,000 per violation, times 50 million….that’s more than the federal budget that just passed. So how did this happen?","Cambridge Analytica was originally hired in 2016 by the Cruz campaign to do analytics work to focus political advertisements most effectively. They use algorithms similar to those previously covered by Anime Right News to scan user data to figure out exactly how to target political messages to make them more effective. Remember when Ben Carson supporters were getting fake news on their timelines that Carson was quitting the race? This is probably how they found the right users. After the Republican primaries, Trump hired Cambridge Analytica to do research, in case the RNC didn’t share their info.","The Trump campaign didn’t really use the data much, since the RNC cooperated, and their data was more accurate. But this became a scandal when it was revealed exactly how Cambridge Analytica acquired the data. In 2014 a Cambridge University professor set up a personality quiz app on Facebook that grabbed the data of 270,000 users directly, then that of their friends. Likes, posts, friends, and comments of up to 50 million people were logged. Cambridge Analytica then acquired the info to use. Consent of the users was not received, and Cambridge Analytica told Facebook the data had been deleted.","Part of the uproar here is due to Trump derangement syndrome gripping the media, anything they can use to hurt Trump they do, and anyone and anything pro-Trump is labeled as bad. Obama used similar targeted advertising in the 2012 election and the media thought it was brilliant. Trump barely used the data, but it’s doubtful that Cambridge Analytica didn’t use the information they had. They claim they didn’t, but when you take a look at the company they have some extremely shady dealings. I wouldn’t believe a word they say.","A recent undercover investigation into Cambridge Analytica yielded some wild results, hidden cameras recorded their CEO(video below) discussing how they destroy opposition politicians reputations. They said they could use prostitutes to honey-pot them and offer bribes, secretly recorded, then release the information on the internet. They claimed to have ex-spies and intelligence community contacts to help dig up dirt to shut people down. They’ve worked in over 200 elections in different countries, these people are shady as hell, and they have info on tons of people.","In the end, this doesn’t look very bad for the Trump campaign but letting people like this get Facebook users’ information looks awful for Facebook. Stocks plummeting, US Congress wants Zuckerberg to testify personally about this, the UK is wanting something similar, they’re facing potential fines from the FTC upwards of $2 trillion, lawsuits, and big users like Elon Musk beginning to delete company pages. Is this the beginning of the end for Facebook?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}
{"originalurl":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/facebook-just-lost-another-user-new-zealands-privacy-commissioner/amp/","title":"Facebook just lost another user — New Zealand’s privacy commissioner – TechCrunch","text":["Mark Zuckerberg’s friend count continues to tick down in the face of a major data misuse scandal griping the company. The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand.","Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network.","He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them.","“Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it.","“Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.”","Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland.","(NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.)","The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges.","The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results).","And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value — and led to a bunch of lawsuits.","“We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on.","“Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.”","He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account.","So, er, ouch.","In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner himself as, er, hostile to privacy…","A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement:","We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further.","This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions.","Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!).","The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning.","Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook.","Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period.","“I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.”","Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot.","But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users.","“They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.”","“Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large.","“It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?”","“They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks.

It has become clear that Facebook is now one of the biggest threats to the western liberal democracy. This is the message from the latest scandal that the company, along with data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica, finds itself embroiled in. The story is still linked to Russia meddling in the US presidential election that saw Donald Trump racing ahead of Hillary Clinton. But around two years after the talk of this meddling started, the contours of the whole operation are coming into sharper focus. And it is in this big picture we meet Cambridge Analytica.","A lot has been said about how Cambridge Analytica worked with the Trump camp to target US voters and how it got data to build psychological profiles of voters from Facebook, so I am going to keep it short. But here is the takeaway: the data that Facebook has on people, and the way this data can be used to build very detailed profiles of people — including their socio-economic conditions, their orientation, their fears, their desires and their political leanings — give companies like Facebook or whoever uses this data an unprecedented leeway. It gives people, companies and organisations that have this data the ability to impact elections in very direct and nefarious ways.","The scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica angered regulators and lawmakers in the US and Europe. In the US, senators are leading fresh inquiries into just how much Facebook, which probably knows its users better than the users themselves, is responsible for the US presidential debacle.","It gives people, companies and organisations that have this data the ability to impact elections in very direct and nefarious ways. Photo: AP","The regulators in the UK are probing Cambridge Analytica and its role in BREXIT vote, in which against all expectations “leave” triumphed over “remain”. The European regulators are taking a fresh look at whether Facebook violated the EU privacy laws or not by allowing its data to be used by Cambridge Analytica.","There are calls to regulate Facebook and streamline its privacy policies. There are calls to force Mark Zuckerberg, one of the most powerful persons in the world right now given how much private data his company has on nearly two billion people, to testify in senate hearings.","But even as the rest of the democratic world takes a look at the threat Facebook is posing to the functional democracy, in India there is no talk on this matter. The Election Commission in the world’s biggest – and socially the most complex – democracy is either turning a blind eye to it or is probably woefully ignorant about the ways in which foreign countries can use Facebook to influence elections in India. It’s not unthinkable. Russians allegedly used Facebook to influence the US elections. There are signs that BREXIT too was a vote that was influenced with social media campaigns.","In fact, Cambridge Analytica has said on record that it has worked with political parties for elections in India. It reportedly worked with the JDU, with help of its Indian partner Ovlene Business Intelligence in Bihar in 2010 and got a success rate of 90 per cent on the seats for which it provided inputs.","Yet, in India, the Election Commission is not looking at how Facebook, or for that matter social media and tools like WhatsApp, can be used by outsiders or by people with dubious aims to influence elections. May be it is already happening. If the presidential election in the US has been influenced by outsiders, what guarantee do we have that some country hasn’t tried to shape elections in India using Facebook or WhatsApp?","The process with which voters can be targeted to influence an election unfairly has been made very easy due to all the data collected by Facebook. And the company, so far, has been fairly cavalier about sharing this data. If you are an advertiser, Facebook is mostly more than happy to share even the most private details of its users with you. If you wave money, it will even let you micro-target the voters so that you can influence their franchise.","The Election Commission in India is supposed to guard elections from exactly the kind of threat that Facebook poses. There is a reason why exit polls in India have to be made public only after voting has ended. There is a reason why during the campaigning there exists a model code of conduct. There is a reason why politicians can’t say some things in their speeches, or political parties can’t induce people by giving them money on voting day.","But using Facebook and WhatsApp, chances are that political parties, or for that matter even actors outside India, can bypass the model code of conduct and break the whole democracy. Facebook data, in a way, can let political parties and organisations play on the fears of the voters, instead of their hopes. It can help politicians reach deep within the minds of voters, using algorithms and big data. In tech parlance, you can say that it can let parties and organisations hack into the minds of voters, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal shows that this can be done by just collecting and analysing the likes and cat videos that people post on Facebook.","The Cambridge Analytica scandal is a wake-up call. The lessons from the last US election were alarming, but the latest scandal involving Facebook shows just how badly social media is damaging democracy. It’s time for India — the world’s biggest democracy — to have a conversation about big data, how it influences elections, the micro-targeting of voters and just how much control Facebook should be allowed to have over people’s lives.","We need to have this conversation now because in 2019 we will be voting in the general election.","The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.","[Update, March 25, 2018, 20:24 Eastern Time]: Facebook has responded to this and other reports regarding the collection of call and SMS data with a blog post that denies Facebook collected call data surreptitiously. The company also writes that it never sells the data and that users are in control of the data uploaded to Facebook. This \"fact check\" contradicts several details Ars found in analysis of Facebook data downloads and testimony from users who provided the data. More on the Facebook response is appended to the end of the original article below.","This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years' worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.","This experience has been shared by a number of other Facebook users who spoke with Ars, as well as independently by us—my own Facebook data archive, I found, contained call-log data for a certain Android device I used in 2015 and 2016, along with SMS and MMS message metadata.","In response to an email inquiry by Ars about this data gathering, a Facebook spokesperson replied, \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","The spokesperson pointed out that contact uploading is optional and installation of the application explicitly requests permission to access contacts. And users can delete contact data from their profiles using a tool accessible via Web browser.","Further Reading","Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past. (For Facebook's instructions on turning off continuous contact uploading, go here. )","If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. From Android 4.1 on, a single request from those applications would trigger two separate permission requests.","But until the \"Marshmallow\" version of Android, even with split permissions, all permissions could still be presented all at once, without users getting the option to decline them individually. So Facebook and other applications could continue to gain access to call and SMS data with a single request by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Starting with Marshmallow, users could toggle these permissions separately themselves. But as many as half of Android users worldwide remain on older versions of the operating system because of carrier restrictions on updates or other issues.","Apple iOS has never allowed access to call log data by third-party apps, overt or silently, so this sort of data acquisition was never possible.","Facebook provides a way for users to purge collected contact data from their accounts, but it's not clear if this deletes just contacts or if it also purges call and SMS metadata. After purging my contact data, my contacts and calls were still in the archive I downloaded the next day—likely because the archive was not regenerated for my new request. (Update: The cached archive was generated once and not updated on the second request. However, two days after a request to delete all contact data, the contacts were still listed by the contact management tool.)","As always, if you're really concerned about privacy, you should not share address book and call-log data with any mobile application. And you may want to examine the rest of what can be found in the downloadable Facebook archive, as it includes all the advertisers that Facebook has shared your contact information with, among other things.","Update, March 25, 2018, continued:","Facebook responded to reports that it collected phone and SMS data without users' knowledge in a \"fact check\" blog post on Sunday. In the response, a Facebook spokesperson stated:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","This contradicts the experience of several users who shared their data with Ars. Dylan McKay told Ars that he installed Messenger in 2015, but only allowed the app the permissions in the Android manifest that were required for installation. He says he removed and reinistalled the app several times over the course of the next few years, but never explicitly gave the app permission to read his SMS records and call history. McKay's call and SMS data runs through July of 2017.","In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used. Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.","While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data.","Facebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \"help friends find each other\" after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \"opt-in\" for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \"OK\" button to approve \"keeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\"","Facebook says that the company keeps the data secure and does not sell it to third parties. But the post doesn't address why it would be necessary to retain not just the numbers of contacts from phone calls and SMS messages, but the date, time, and length of those calls for years."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

They told them were seeking help in influencing political campaigns in Sri Lanka, and met with them in several meetings at hotels in London.","“If you’re collecting data on people and you’re profiling them,” said Alex Taylor, the chief data officer, “that gives you more insight that you can use to know how to segment the population, to give them messaging about issues that they care about, and language and imagery that they’re likely to engage with.

These sorts of tactics are very effective. Instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”","‘We have lots of history of things’","“And the operative you will use for this is who?” the agent asked.","“Well someone known to us,” Nix said.","“OK, so it is somebody, you won’t use a Sri Lankan person?” the agent asked.","“No, no, we’ll have a wealthy developer come in,” Nix explained, “somebody posing as a wealthy developer. They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land, for instance. We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras. We’ll blank out the face of our guy, and then post it on the internet.”","“So on Facebook or YouTube or something like this?” the agent asked.","“Send some girls around to the candidate’s house,” Nix added. “We have lots of history of things.”","“For example you’re saying when you’re using the girls to introduce to the local fellow,” the agent asked, “and you’re using the girls for this, like the seduction, they’re not local girls, not Sri Lankan girls?”","“I wouldn’t have thought so no, we’ll bring some,” Nix responded, “I mean, that was just an idea. Just saying we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know.

Then, after gathering these data and having them analyzed, the agency sold this information to businesses, foreign governments, anyone who may be interested in using it in any way they wished — with no questions asked.","Then, consider what would happen if some sinister players started using these data to incite violence, spread hatred, or rig elections. They are provided with enough information at a granular level to identify, say, Muslims with extreme views, or Christians who feel marginalized, or homemakers unhappy with their marriage. These troublemakers are also able to send false information to groups. They could do this at a very low cost, without having to disclose their identity or motivation.","I am describing what Facebook makes possible. The United Nations has accused Facebook of playing a “determining role” in stirring up hatred and genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar. “It has substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict, if you will, within the public,” said Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar.","To be clear, Facebook isn’t scouting neighborhoods for information or knowingly supporting any malicious actions. It has automated tools, possibly ignorant of the consequences of their use.","We gain a lot from the global exchange of information that Facebook makes possible. It has brought loved ones closer and made the world a smaller place. But Facebook’s ability to recognize faces in photos more accurately than humans can is worrying. It can learn all about us from the comments we post, the news stories we read, and the pages we “like.” Even if we don’t tell Facebook where we were on a particular evening, or who our friends are, it can “see” the photos other people have posted and learn what it needs.","Facebook also owns WhatsApp and harvests data from the app. Using the sensors on smartphones, WhatsApp has the ability to keep track of our location and activity levels and to know who we are meeting, where, and how long we have been with them. In an exchange of emails, the company indicated it does not track location beyond the country level and does not share contacts nor messages, which are encrypted, with Facebook.","WhatsApp did confirm, however, that it is sharing user phone numbers, device identifiers, operating system information, control choices, and usage information with the “Facebook family of companies.” So that leaves open the question as to whether Facebook could then track those users at a granular level, even if WhatsApp doesn’t.","Big Brother in George Orwell’s 1984 could have only dreamt of having the information that Facebook has.","Facebook has become a huge part of public, civil, and private life. UN investigator Yanghee Lee said about Myanmar, “…everything is done through Facebook … [but] I’m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended.”","Technology has given us many gifts. But it is increasingly being manipulated in ways intended to promote the makers’ profit over individual and collective wellbeing. The good of internet platforms is now being offset by flaws invisible to most users. Social media is being weaponized in the name of profit.","This is happening because Facebook and other internet platforms are consciously turning their users into addicts to make their products and advertising more valuable. They combine propaganda techniques with addiction strategies perfected by the gambling industry.","They provide value to users while creating filter bubbles that reinforce pre-existing beliefs in ways that make those beliefs more extreme and inflexible, causing many users to reject new information and even facts.","This is why governments need to stringently regulate Facebook. France ordered WhatsApp to stop sharing user data with parent company Facebook. Others must do the same. And they must force Facebook to crack down on hate speech — with heavy fines for every single violation.","Not just Facebook’s, but all data must be protected. A good start is Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, going into effect in May, which requires companies to get unambiguous consent from users to collect data, to clearly disclose how personal data are being used, and to spell out why the data are being collected. Governments must also ban any form of political advertising and the sale of data to third parties.","This is not a matter of protectionism. It is about freedom and democracy itself. Technology is making amazing things possible. But it also has a dark side. We have to balance the risks with the rewards."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

It's right. What really happened is much worse.","On Saturday, an investigation by The New York Times, the Guardian, and its sister publication The Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that helped the Donald Trump presidential campaign had harvested the Facebook data of more than 50 million people in an effort to profile users and eventually target them with political ads.","Advertisement","In 2014, a researcher collected the data through an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. Around 270,000 people agreed to have their data collected through the test, which its creator, Aleksandr Kogan, defined as “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.” But thanks to Facebook’s terms of service and its API at the time, the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the researcher, who later handed the data to Cambridge Analytica, the raw information of more than 50 million people, according to the reports, which were largely based on the account of a former Cambridge Analytica data scientist.","The Observer called it one of Facebook’s “biggest ever data breaches.” The Times only referred to the incident as a “breach” once, using the term “leak” throughout the rest of the article. We at Motherboard believe the use of the expression “data breach” in this case is incorrect and may be confusing to readers.","As the news spread and echoed online, several websites and other publications called it a data breach. Manysecurityexperts and researchers—and Facebook itself—believe this is the wrong expression to refer to what happened here.","“It is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a deleted tweet.","Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false,” because the researcher who made the app obtained the data from “users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.”","Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzo@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzo@motherboard.tv","Advertisement","Saying that “everyone involved” consented seems misleading, given that only around 270,000 out of the 50 million people who got their data harvested reportedly signed up for the app. The others probably had no idea this app even existed. And since Facebook changes its privacy settings so frequently, we also don't know if the people who agreed to use the app fully understood what kind of data they were giving up. And no one at the time knew the data would later be handed out to a shadowy data analytics firm hired by the Trump campaign.","While we understand why some are describing the data Kogan handed to Cambridge Analytica as a breach, based on what’s been reported so far, we believe that describing this incident as a breach would, at least at the moment, mislead our readers.","We’ve been regularly covering data breaches for years. No one hacked into Facebook’s servers exploiting a bug, like hackers did when they stole the personal data of more than 140 million people from Equifax. No one tricked Facebook users into giving away their passwords and then stole their data, like Russian hackers did when they broke into the email accounts of John Podesta and others through phishing emails.","In 2014, when Kogan collected the data of 50 million people, he was playing by the rules. At the time, Facebook allowed third party apps to collect not only the data of the people who consented to giving it up, but also their friends’ data. The company later shut down this functionality.","Facebook says the data was misused because Kogan told Facebook he would use it only for academic research. But that might be the only anomalous thing about this case.","Facebook obviously doesn't want the public to think it suffered a massive security breach, like Yahoo did in 2013 and 2014. We agree not because we want to minimize the significance of the Cambridge Analytica story, but because the real story is far more troubling: This data collection was par for the course. In other words, it was a feature, not a bug. And while the process that Kogan exploited is no longer allowed, Facebook still collects—and then sells—massive amounts of data on its users.","Advertisement","As Zeynep Tufekci, the author of Twitter And Tear Gas, put it, Facebook’s vehement defense that this was not a data breach is itself actually a damning statement of what’s wrong with Facebook, and Silicon Valley’s ad industry in general.","“If your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used & misused,” Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote on Twitter. “There is no informed consent because it's not possible to reasonably inform or consent.”","Facebook’s security team, Tufekci concluded, can’t mitigate the company’s business model, which is predicated on collecting as much of our data, and our friend’s data, as possible.","We can condemn the misuse of this data, and Facebook’s data collection practices, without calling it a data breach, a term that may confuse readers and distract them from what we believe is the real problem here: Silicon Valley giants have built massive data collection machines with almost no guardrails on how they are used."],"isopubdate":""}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

That's because over its 14 years in existence, Facebook has aggressively wormed its way into the lives of its users — both current and past.","And the company knows way more about you than just what you've intentionally shared.","The most prominent example of this is the so-called shadow profile. It was revealed in 2013 that the company's profiles of its users included information outside of the normal scope of a Facebook account. Things like your non-Facebook associated email or your phone number — even if you've never purposefully handed it over — are likely on the company's servers and pegged to your real-world identity.","This is the result of Facebook's practice of asking for, and often receiving, permission from your friends to upload their contacts in order to discover others on the network they may know. In addition to helping you find that friend of a friend that you don't really care about, this access has given Facebook an unparalleled view into the lives of the billions of people both on and off its platform.","What's more, Facebook announced in 2016 that intended to show ads to non-users across the web. Following this news, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Palo Alto-based advertising behemoth would \"collect information about all Internet users\" via cookies and \"like\" buttons scattered across the web.","That's right, even if you've never had a Facebook account, the company could still be tracking you — and making a profit in the process. Thankfully, there is a small glimmer of hope. Bloomberg reported in February that a Belgian court ruled Facebook must stop tracking non users. While this is good news, it doesn't solve the immediate problem for everyone not residing in Belgium. And anyway, Facebook said it would appeal the decision.","Creeping hard.","Image: pool/Getty","But don't get dispirited! All of this is not to say that you shouldn't delete your Facebook account. You absolutely should. Honestly, you won't miss that much. And while you're at it, go ahead and ditch Facebook-owned Instagram too (the algorithmic timeline has made it a frustrating mess, anyway). For good measure, also get rid of WhatsApp — try Signal instead.","Oh, and by \"delete\" we mean delete. Facebook is very good at making it difficult to leave its soul-sucking ecosystem. Those that attempt to do so are directed to the option to \"deactivate\" an account, which is very much not the same thing as deletion. To truly delete your account you have to navigate your way through a bunch of garbage options before you are finally presented the real chance to make an escape.","Even when you finally do pull the proverbial trigger, Facebook is going to take its sweet time letting you go.

One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised ‘systemic problems’ with Facebook’s business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform.","The head of European Parliament said on Monday that EU lawmakers will investigate whether the data misuse has taken place, adding the allegation is an unacceptable violation of citizens’ privacy rights.","Facebook was already facing new calls for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after the reports from the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend.","The papers reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, and that the information had not been deleted despite Facebook demands dating back to 2015.","“We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a “sell” rating on a stock that rose 60 percent last year.","Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before.","He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company’s business for now, with advertisers unlikely to “suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform”.","The losses would be Facebook’s biggest daily fall since a broader market pullback in February. In January, when Facebook announced changes to its newsfeed which it said would hit user engagement in the near term, shares fell 4.5 percent in one day.","“Its clear with more ‘heat in the kitchen from the Beltway’ that further modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” said Daniel Ives, research analyst at GBH Insights.","He also argued that the issue was “background noise” on which Facebook could calm any regulatory nerves through further investments in security, ad content AI, improved content algorithms and screening mechanisms.","No analysts had so far changed their price targets or recommendations on Facebook in response to the reports. Wall Street is largely bullish on the stock with 40 of 44 analysts recommending the stock “buy” or higher.","Shares of the company were down 4 percent at $177.68 in premarket trading on Monday."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

News outlets reported on the FTC investigation last week, but the FTC hadn't confirmed it until Monday. Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances.","Facebook said Sunday that this information is uploaded to secure servers and comes only from people who gave explicit consent to allow it.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic","By David Ingram and Julia Fioretti","(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network, a step that follows a scandal over how Facebook handles personal information.","The world's largest social media company is under pressure to improve its handling of data after disclosing that information about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook adjusted the privacy settings on its service on Wednesday, giving users control over their personal information in fewer taps.","Facebook has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom Corp (ACXM.O) and Experian PLC (EXPN.L).","The tool has been widely used among certain categories of advertisers - such as automakers, luxury goods producers and consumer packaged goods companies - who do not sell directly to consumers and have relatively little information about who their customers are, according to Facebook.","\"While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook,\" Graham Mudd, a Facebook product marketing director, said in a statement.","Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to $25 after Facebook's announcement after the bell. Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged.","Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March.","The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.","However, for the 2019 fiscal year, Acxiom expects total revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted by as much as $25 million.","Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue.","Advertisers would still be able to use third-party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data, Facebook said.","Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.","Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users' anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.","Facebook's shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.","The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook's lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.","SCRUTINY FROM LAWMAKERS","Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologised for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers' access to user information.","There is a new Facebook page - called Access Your Information - where users can see what they have shared and manage it.","\"The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfils Mark Zuckerberg's promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.","It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers.","They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a \"right to portability\" - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.","Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamouring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users' data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.","He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.","Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing.","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook, and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened.","(Reporting by David Ingram and Julia Fioretti; Additional reporting by Laharee Chatterjee, Arjun Panchadar and Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by James Dalgleish and Cynthia Osterman)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

This original idea and concept blossomed into something that influenced and sculpted the childhoods of many, myself included. It became Disney’s, ‘The Lion King.’","For me, it, and other Disney films, nurtured something important and essential for anyone with an idea — imagination. So in a way, it could be argued that Charlie Fink the guy who came up with the idea of ‘Bambi in Africa’ during his time at Disney laid down fertile soil for an idea like Bubbled to grow.","Fink is a former Disney, AOL and AG Interactive executive who writes about VR, AR and new media for Forbes. In the 90s, Fink was EVP & COO of VR pioneer Virtual World Entertainment. He is now a consultant and frequent speaker on these topics at conferences like CES, SXSW, AWE, ARiA NYU, ARiA MIT, Digital Hollywood, VR Toronto (keynote), VR Voice Entertainment Summit (keynote), and “On The Lot” by VRS (keynote).","In short, he knows AR. We had a chat about the AR cloud a few weeks back.","He is absolutely right, of course.","Web 2.0 — The Old Internet","From the dotcom boom, a number of companies emerged that became so large that they eclipsed the original purpose of Tim Berner-Lee’s vision for the internet being “a collaborative medium, a place where we could all meet and read and write.” John Battelle and Tim O’Reilly outlined their definition of the “Web as Platform”, where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, was that the “customers are building your business for you”.","Google and Facebook are perfect examples of how in web 2.0 a user is invited to contribute to the site’s content by commenting on published articles or creating a user account or profile on the site, which may enable increased participation. By increasing emphasis on these already-extant capabilities, they encourage the user to rely more on their browser for user interface, application software (“apps”) and file storage facilities.","These companies, along with others like Apple and Microsoft have made it extremely easy to navigate what we call the ‘internet’ but what in reality are — siloed platforms owned by these centrally governed companies; all of whom have investors to answer to.","The monopoly of the internet by these monolithic companies is virtually absolute. They control the app store markets they facilitate; any innovation that occurs off platform they acquire, any new markets that surface they will dominate. Augmented reality cannot be the same.","Level 1 are apps built on centralized app platforms, Level 2 are built independently but later acquired","Decentralized Web 3.0 vs. Business as Usual","Fink’s observation is correct — if the AR cloud is to be centralized. Gatekeepers, like Apple and Google are the guys you have to cosy up to if you want to succeed in building and delivering a centralized AR cloud as they are providing the toolkit for you to build, store and deliver your vision, via namely arkit and arcore — however, decentralization hands the keys back into the hands of the community. It removes the ‘Business as Usual’ scenario, where the centralized web giants continue in dominating a market which has become rife with:","Indiscriminate use of personal data","Curtailing of content creator benefits","Fake news","Inappropriate content","Decentralization is the movement of departments within a organization away from a single point of administration.","Decentralization, when enacted out using distributed ledger technology (Blockchain) enables the consolidation of functions usually performed by set departments within a large organisation, to be performed by a smart contract, digitally. This means tasks like data storage, decision making and content management are not managed centrally but rather, autonomously run; managed by pre-programmed smart contracts more commonly known as ‘cryptocurrency.’","What does this mean for the end user?","Users get to interact directly with each other, without the interaction taking place on a platform centrally controlled by a company seeking ways to monetise the information they share. Content they create can be monetised and sold directly P2P, without the need of a 3rd party platform hosting the content on centrally held servers and charging a 70/30 revenue split.","Apps, known as dApps (Decentralized Apps) when built on the blockchain are interfaces that allow a user to access a specific set of functions using a blockchain’s protocol via a platforms unique set of smart contracts aka cryptocurrency. The only barrier to access is whether or not the user holds the cryptocurrency needed to unlock the function of the platform — not third parties and their fees.","Blockchain, Protocols and Underpants Gnomes","The ‘Underpants Gnomes’ comment references the infamous episode in South Park where a group of gnomes have been stealing underpants as part of a bigger plan, broken down into three phases:","Phase 1: Collect Underpants","Phase 2: ?","Phase 3: Profit","When the gnomes are pressed on the question mark and asked how, exactly, they get from underpants to profits, they don’t have a good answer.","Again, Fink highlights one of the biggest issues with a lot of projects in the blockchain space. Many are building really innovative, decentralised infrastructures that have the potential to solve real world issues but without taking steps to identify, describe and develop a business case that serves real world business needs and have the potential to realise profit via a dApp.","The Bubbled Platform","Phase 1 — Collect Underpants","Level 1 is the Bubbled platform that identifies and enables holders of the smart contract BBL to purchase unique geo-locations on the blockchain and create a new type of fungible digital asset. Holders of this virtual land can then register (or not) for the BFAR (http://bfar.org.uk) to support the code of conduct, starting the building of a framework of governance for AR content placed in real-world locations. Using decentralised storage protocols such as IPFS enables AR content to be uploaded locally based on the creators geo-location and pulled by other users locally that want to access that content.","Key features of a decentralized AR cloud:","“We use content-addressing so content can be decoupled from origin servers, and instead, can be stored permanently. This means content can be stored and served very close to the user, perhaps even from a computer in the same room. Content-addressing allows us to verify the data too, because other hosts may be untrusted. And once the user’s device has the content, it can be cached indefinitely.”","Content-addressing and content-signing protect IPFS-based sites, making DDoS attacks impossible. And to help mitigate the damage of discontinued websites, IPFS also archives important public-record content, and can easily store important, public-record content.","Phase 2 — ?","There is a need for decentralised business entities to translate the activity that occurs within the crypto-universe into a profit making and therefore ‘taxable supply’ in the fiat-universe. This is level 2.","Identifying a present or future market opportunity that can allow a solution to be built, creating a credible and profit making business. There are already steps being taken to enable businesses to start advertising in AR; however these solutions will be centralised.","The Branded and cLand dApps are solutions which allow real-world companies who want to take steps to share branded content in this new medium. They provide an interface to let these businesses connect to virtual landowners and AR content providers creating a new marketplace.","The decentralised community are governed by the BBL smart contracts and can directly monetise their activity within the crypto-universe in fiat terms, based on their efforts on the Bubbled platform.","No more trying to find a bank to convert their ROI from flipping crypto on exchanges; we enable a way to monetise directly in the fiat world without paying any 3rd parties for your efforts. The Bubbled AR viewer and SDK enables apps to update and provide a window to a ubiquitous metaverse for their existing community; AR developers have access to an ever-growing community on a global platform to create their own decentral solutions. The Blocklord dApp is one such solution, an ethereum-based game which uses the Bubbled platform to identify parcels for a blockchain based version of ‘Monopoly.’","We also only connect these businesses to actors who subscribe to a global code of conduct as members of BFAR, helping form a layer of protection against potential legal action in this rapidly emerging, yet wholly ungoverned market.","Phase 3 — Profit","Our company, which facilitates the interface of these decentralised applications realise revenue from a subscription-based business model payable by the subscribing businesses seeking to connect to owners of decentralized virtual spaces and creators of AR content. This is level 3 in the diagram.","We are still in the early stages of AR and the decentralization of web 3.0, but with AR predicted to be the next trillion dollar industry and the growth of the cryptocurrency market cap from $20bn in January 2017 to $450bn January 2018 — it is clear to see we are at the beginning stages of the evolution of visual communications and a new type of currency.","If you are an AR app developer, AR content producer or interested in owning your own virtual space you can participate and contribute to the decentralized ecosystem here:"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-15"}

Photograph: AFP/Getty Images","If the revelations that Cambridge Analytica acquired the records of 50 million Facebook users has you wondering how to protect your own personal information, you may already have discovered the maze of privacy settings the social networking site offers.","First, the good news: the feature that allowed the most egregious data harvesting used by the company that gave Cambridge Analytica its data is no longer on the site.","Before 2016, Facebook apps could ask for permission to access not only your own data, but also the data of all your friends on the platform. That means that around 300,000 people could sign up for a personality test quiz, and in the process hand over information of 150 times that number.","Now, however, Facebook apps are only allowed to gather information from users who have directly signed up for them, greatly limiting their reach. That change was made in 2014, and rolled out to every Facebook app over the course of 2015.","But it’s still the case that apps which you have directly enabled can harvest a significant amount of data from your account – often information which you might be surprised to know you’re handing over.","The app settings page on Facebook is the place to manage the apps you’ve given access to. Clicking on the link will bring up a list of apps under “logged in with Facebook”. Hopefully you’ll recognise most of them – if there’s any you don’t, consider clicking the “X”, deauthorising them from your account.","You might also want to click on the edit button under the “apps others use” heading lower down the page. This takes you to your privacy settings for the modern version of the same feature Cambridge Analytica profited from. The information others can hand over on your behalf is limited, but still includes data such as your date of birth, religious and political views, and activities, interests and things you like. Consider unchecking all the boxes. According to Facebook, leaving them all checked will make your friends’ “experience better and more social”, which doesn’t seem like a good trade-off for you.","If that’s not enough for you to feel safe, maybe now’s the time to delete your Facebook account altogether.","That’s somewhat harder to do. If you go through the account settings, Facebook will attempt to push you to “deactivate” your account, which “will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook”. Notably, it won’t remove any of your data from Facebook’s servers, and your account lies dormant hoping you will change your mind.","If you actually want to delete your information from Facebook, the real setting is hidden in a help document with the title “how do I permanently delete my account?” Clicking on “let us know” on that page will take users to the real account deletion screen. Clicking “delete my account” will take you to another screen. Filling in your password and proving you aren’t a robot on that screen will finally… deactivate your account. Wait two weeks after that, and then, at long last, Facebook will begin the 90 day process of deleting all your data from the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

While the hardware wasn’t expected to be available until the fall, the company had hoped to preview the devices at the largest annual gathering of Facebook developers, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing internal plans.","The devices are part of Facebook’s plan to become more intimately involved with users’ everyday social lives, using artificial intelligence -- following a path forged by Amazon.com Inc. and its Echo in-home smart speakers. As concerns escalate about Facebook’s collection and use of personal data, now may be the wrong time to ask consumers to trust it with even more information by placing a connected device in their homes. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.","Facebook has faced a public reckoning this month about its treatment of user data, sparked by reports that political-advertising firm Cambridge Analytica obtained information on 50 million users without their permission.

They keep lying to you, evening after evening.","This is what their reporting is worth — just one big fake news.","Moshe Nussbaum is a veteran reporter and analyst for Israel’s Channel 2 News, covering police matters and criminal investigations. Specifically, he is the reporting face of Channel 2’s ongoing coverage of the police investigations into Netanyahu on suspicion of criminal corruption, graft, and bribery.","Police investigators questioned Netanyahu and his wife Sara today for the second time under caution, in separate locations, in connection with Case 4000, otherwise known as the Bezeq Case. The case involves allegations that Netanyahu traded favorable regulatory laws with Saul Elovitch, the CEO of the giant telecom, in exchange for positive coverage of the prime minister and his wife in Walla!, the Bezeq-owned popular news and entertainment portal. According to information reported about the investigation, Netanyahu’s wife Sara is suspected of communicating directly with Saul Elovitch’s wife Iris, sending her text messages with specific instructions regarding the nature of the favorable coverage she wanted in Walla!.","Two weeks ago the prime minister’s former chief communications advisor and intimate aide, Nir Hefetz, turned state’s witness in exchange for complete immunity from prosecution. Hefetz reportedly saved communications that implicate the Netanyahus in the Bezeq case, including tangible evidence that Sara Netanyahu tried to subvert the investigation by deleting text messages. Last week one Israeli newspaper reported that Netanyahu was hoping for “a miracle” to save him from a criminal indictment. Police investigators have hinted that they intend to have Netanyahu respond directly to evidence provided by Hefetz, with the two men seated at the same table.","This is not the first time Netanyahu has targeted Moshe Nussbaum, the Channel 2 criminal affairs reporter. Last year during a speech, the prime minister mocked Nussbaum’s mannerisms and his bushy eyebrows. He later apologized in a phone call, with Nussbaum responding that he was not offended.","Notably missing from the list of media outlets that Netanyahu describes as “fake news” are Israel Hayom and Makor Rishon; both aredaily publications owned by Sheldon Adelson, the American Jewish casino billionaire and Trump supporter who is Netanyahu’s patron. Israel Hayom is so overtly pro Netanyahu that it is widely referred to in Israel as the “Bibiton,” a portmanteau of the prime minister’s nickname (Bibi) and the Hebrew word for newspaper (iton). Also missing from the prime minister’s list is Channel 20, the newly launched television station that is national-religious Zionist, pro-settler and pro-Netanyahu.","For political observers who have been following Netanyahu since he was re-elected prime minister in 2009 (after a disastrous first term in the late-1990s), the similarities between the authoritarian tactics employed by the Israeli prime minister and by U.S. president Donald Trump are striking. Both men speak directly to their base via their social media accounts, circumventing the veteran media outlets. Both men make overtly racist statements via social media — a notable example is Netanyahu’s infamous 2015 election video, posted to his Facebook wall, in which he calls out his supporters to save his government because “Arabs are voting in droves.”","Furthermore, both men constantly undermine the credibility of the fourth estate, one of the essential pillars of a robust and functioning democracy, by describing them as ‘fake news’ and ‘liars.’ And both level personal attacks at journalists they dislike, or whose coverage worries them, by attacking not only their professional credibility but also their physical appearance.","US President Donald Trump with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prior to Trump departure to Rome at the Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv on May 23, 2017. (Kobi Gideon / GPO)","Hence Netanyahu comments on Moshe Nussbaum’s eyebrows and mannerisms in a speech to his followers, while Trump mockedNew York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski for his physical disability and claimed that Megyn Kelly had “blood coming out of her whatever” after she questioned him sharply during one of the Republican party’s primary debates.","Israel Hayom is financed by Netanyahu’s billionaire patron for the purpose of promoting and supporting the prime minister. It is a free newspaper that is distributed throughout the country, including home delivery. Since its launch in 2009, Israel Hayom has become the country’s most widely-read publication; its impact on the discourse has been notable, speaking to the power of the media to shape public opinion. Now Netanyahu is working methodically, in the absence of a miracle, to discredit veteran media outlets that might sway public opinion against him as the walls of the criminal investigation close in on him.","Before you go...","A lot of work goes into creating articles like the one you just read.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Goff’s team used Facebook and other tools to register more than a million voters online and to raise $690 million online in 2011 and 2012.","“The thing we did that will be most affected — by which I mean rendered impossible — by the changes they're making is the targeted sharing tool,” Goff said.","More than 1 million Obama supporters in 2012 installed the campaign’s Facebook app. These supporters were given the option to share their friend list with the Obama campaign. Goff said most of the app users did so. And when they did, Goff’s team would then “run those friend lists up against the voter file, and make targeted suggestions as to who [supporters] should be sharing stuff with.”","This was a powerful new form of voter outreach. The Obama campaign had concluded that many voters — especially younger Americans — viewed TV and other forms of advertising from the campaign with suspicion and skepticism. But they were still open to messages that came from friends and acquaintances.","The key to getting persuasive messages in front of persuadable voters going forward, the campaign decided, was to have them come from people they knew.","“It's extremely powerful for a campaign to be able to say to [a user], ‘Hey, here are your persuadable friends, ranked in order of where they live: Ohio first, Virginia second, et cetera. Go share this video directly with them,'” Goff said.","The Romney campaign also started doing this, but only in October, a month before the presidential election.","Then in the spring of 2014, Facebook — responding to growing privacy concerns — cracked down on how much information third-party applications could gain about those who installed the apps.","“We've heard from people that they're often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app,” wrote Facebook engineering manager Jeffrey Spehar in a blog post. “So we've updated Facebook Login so that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list.”","Today, when Facebook users choose to share their friend list with an app, only those friends who also use the app become visible, Facebook spokeswoman Tera Randall told Yahoo News.","The changes went into effect for new apps on April 30, and existing apps were given a year before the change applied to them. (In technical terms, what Facebook is doing is changing its Graph application programming interface, or API, as well as the terms of service for app developers.)","What this means in practice is that a group like Ready for Hillary, the grass-roots network of supporters for a Clinton presidential run, has been able to use targeted sharing over the past year. That means it has the Facebook friend lists of all the people who’ve installed Ready for Hillary’s app on the social network.","But when the API and terms-of-service changes become permanent for all apps, Ready for Hillary — as well as any campaign that has bought its voter information — won’t be able to keep up to date with its supporters’ most recent lists of friends, and will learn nothing about the Facebook friends of new supporters. Facebook’s change becomes permanent on April 30, 2015.","Most of the Republican presidential hopefuls, meanwhile, will not get the chance to use the tool at all.","Aside from a brief article over the summer in Campaigns & Elections and one more recently in AdAge, the political press has not taken notice of the change.","Already, though, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has decided not to put time and resources into using Facebook’s targeted sharing tools.","“We could have continued to use it just for this cycle, and it could have been useful to some degree, but for me it was a question of resource prioritization,” said a senior NRSC official. “I wanted to focus on getting the fundamentals right first, then building up the chain of sophistication.”","The NRSC official said that when the committee did use targeted sharing in the Massachusetts special election in June 2013, it showed results, but “we just didn't see the engagement numbers we needed to see to indicate that it was going to be transformative this [past] cycle.”","“Plus, the API and News Feed changes have been so frequent over the past several years that we somewhat doubted the assurances that it would still work on [Election Day],” the NRSC official said. “Even if so, anything we built would have to be scrapped after the cycle; it couldn't serve as the foundation for future cycles, like email list development.”","But the quest to reach voters through their friends will continue to be a highly competitive space in politics.","“I’m not convinced there aren’t going to be ways [to work around the Facebook change]. But nobody has found a way yet,” Goff said.","Stu Trevelyan, CEO of NGP VAN, the top software tool for Democratic campaigns, said that there are still ways to “track relationships in non-Facebook ways.”","NGP VAN’s interface, which taps into voter databases, is used by virtually every Democratic campaign up and down the ballot. So the level of volunteer use around the country is high. And NGP VAN has also created an Action Center tool that has been mapping relationship data among Democratic volunteers and Ready for Hillary supporters.","“[Ready for Hillary] said, ‘Hey supporters, go to the Action Center and share with your friends that they should come and sign up for a free Ready for Hillary bumper sticker,'” Trevelyan said. “Let’s say I clicked on your link and went and asked for a bumper sticker. My record would show in the VAN database that I was recruited by you and you recruited me. There’s a whole level of observed activity.”","“There is an element of our tool currently that uses that Facebook API, but it’s not the only way or even the predominant way that we are mapping relationships,” Trevelyan said.","But as the NRSC official put it, “It seems that the days of getting 1 million users to scrape all of America's social data are gone.”"],"isopubdate":"2014-11-17"}

Or was there potentially illegal co-ordination between campaigns?","Jeffrey Donaldson, DUP Brexit campaign manager.","Democratic Unionist Party politician Jeffrey Donaldson has said that he couldn’t remember why his party choose to spend more than £32,000 during the Brexit campaign on a controversial data analytics company linked to Donald Trump.","The DUP paid £32,750 to Aggregate IQ, an obscure data analytics company based in British Columbia, Canada, according to accounts filed with the Electoral Commission. This money was to target voters on social media during the Brexit referendum campaign. But DUP Brexit campaign manager Jeffrey Donaldson could not tell us how he discovered Aggregate IQ, a company that had almost no online presence last June.","“I’m afraid I don’t have the files in front of me, so I’ll have to check the records for you,” the Lagan Valley MP said. “I think it was an internal recommendation,” Donaldson added.","Why a political party in Northern Ireland decided to spend more than half its budget for the 2015 general election with an unheard of data analytics company in Canada is not clear. But what we do know is that more money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. Vote Leave, the official leave campaign, spent £3.9m with the company.","An on-going Observer investigation has found that Aggregate IQ has very close ties to Cambridge Analytica and hedge fund billionaire and Donald Trump-backer Robert Mercer. Cambridge Analytica have been credited by some with “psychological warfare techniques” to help swing the US presidential election in Trump’s favour.","Earlier this year, openDemocracy revealed how more than £435,000 was funneled into the DUP’s Brexit campaign. Under Northern Irish electoral law, the source of this dark money has remained secret but we do know that money came through the Constitutional Research Council, a shadowy group chaired by Richard Cook, a former vice chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.","Co-ordination between campaign groups is illegal under UK electoral law unless their expenditure is counted together – a law designed to ensure that no one can get around campaign spending limits by setting up front groups. Aside from the official Vote Leave campaign, three affiliated leave campaigns – BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party – spent a total of £757,750 with Aggregate IQ. The Observer asked Veterans for Britain where they heard about Aggregate IQ. David Banks Veterans for Britain head of communications said: “I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us.”","Both the DUP and Vote Leave has denied any co-ordination between the two campaigns. Lee Reynolds, a DUP staffer in Belfast who took a break from the party to oversee the official Vote Leave campaign in Northern Ireland denied recommending Aggregate IQ to the DUP. “I wasn’t co-operating with the DUP I was working for Vote Leave at the time,” Reynolds told openDemocracy. DUP North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds was a board member of Vote Leave.","The £435,000 donation given to the DUP’s Brexit campaign has been the source of on-going controversy. In the run-up to March’s Northern Irish assembly elections DUP leader Arlene Foster denied knowing the size of the donation or the specific source. Jeffrey Donaldson has admitted to openDemocracy that he did not know about the links between Richard Cook and Saudi intelligence services.","This article is published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International licence.\nIf you have any queries about republishing please contact us.\nPlease check individual images for licensing details."],"isopubdate":"2017-05-16"}

Late last year, for instance, then Senator Al Franken pressed the company over Face ID — a subject to which Apple quickly responded.","Cook’s statement reflects similar comments Steve Jobs made about privacy back in 2010 and an event where Mark Zuckerberg was also speaking.","“Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly,” Jobs said. “I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.”","In his own address, Cook noted that many of the concerns around what companies might do with all of the personal data “has come true more than once.”","Cook also addressed growing tensions between the U.S. and China, a market that has been increasingly important to Apple’s bottom line — and, of course, a place where much of the company’s manufacturing occurs.","“My belief is that businesses should be engaged with governments in countries where they are doing business, whether they agree or disagree,” Cook said, according to Reuters.","Tensions between the two countries have only grown more heated in recent days.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","\"I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the \"maximum exposure\" could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more - likely in the tens of millions - because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user's list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend's demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","\"They say 'trust us,' but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement.","Rep. Adam Schiff, Calif., the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","\"I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,\" Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. \"There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms.\"","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union's justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","\"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,\" Collins said Sunday. \"It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.\"","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","\"We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,\" Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, said in the statement. \"That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.\"","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a \"breach\" of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook's request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor's role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook's privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica's app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ecree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, \"We've heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.\" That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend's data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday, \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, \"bespeaks the same recklessness with its users' data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.\"","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","\"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,\" Rich said. \"They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.\"","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users' sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users' friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users' explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers' consent before \"enacting changes that override their privacy practices,\" the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","\"This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can't do the job.\"","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., also criticized Facebook on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"","\"Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they're above the rules that apply to everybody else,\" Rubio said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Later, he co-founded the Internet Freedom Foundation which advocates digital rights. Pahwa spoke to Kim Arora about the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, and what it means for data protection. Excerpts:","Cambridge Analytica collected data for poll campaigns under the guise of academic research. Where does this leave informed consent?","From an informed consent perspective, it is obvious that users really have no right over their data when it is going to private parties because the law allows private parties to share that data forward.","There needs to be a significant purpose limitation in case of any kind of consent architecture for such services. But I want to go back to something more important, which is the mass collection of data which is granular, and in this case not just demographic and psychographic, but also behavioural.","The power that a platform has to change the course of democracy is something we have to be cognizant of, because there is no control that individual nation-states have over such a large entity. I’m not saying Facebook here is a bad actor or is going to be a bad actor, but even if it were one, how would we know? We can’t rely on the benevolence of Facebook for them not to mess with any democracy.","Data being collected at the central level with Aadhaar and at the state level with State Resident Data Hub can be shareable in the absence of a state-level law even without consent. At an individual level, it can be shareable with third parties, and once it goes to a third party, you have no control over what happens to it.","What Cambridge Analytica did was target people from a behavioural perspective. One has to take a step back and assess the impact of mining data for psychological profiling. This is not just about Facebook, but about all large data-collecting platforms whether it is Twitter, Google or Aadhaar.","There is a global market failure in data protection and privacy. By saying that as a country we need to collect more data to compete with all of these companies, we get into a race to the bottom. What we need is a global regime of data disarmament.","Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the harvested data. In India, uploaded Aadhaar details are taken down when there is a hue and cry. How effective are such steps?","If you look at the Centre for Internet and Society report (on reported leakage of 135 million Aadhaar details last year), government departments had uploaded Excel sheets with people’s name, address, date of birth, bank account number, caste, father’s name, etc. Even though that data was taken down, it has already been circulated, and could be on the dark web for all you know. People have already been compromised, but we have to at least prevent further compromise.","How can lay users protect themselves?","At the bare minimum, you can change all your privacy settings to minimum sharing of data. Go and uninstall most of the apps that you already have that collect this data. Be conscious of all the data that apps are collecting.","This is what we are calling the Truecaller question in the data protection regime. Can I share your data when I have it? What happened in the Cambridge Analytica case was that they collected the data of not just the people who gave consent, but also that of people who were connected to those who gave consent. How will a law prevent that from happening?","Technically then, how do we see this? Theft of Facebook’s data or its users’ data?","Ownership of the data is the other question that has not been answered. Who owns Aadhaar data? And who owns it with respect to Facebook — does Facebook own it or do you own it? That is what the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union) tries to address — with the right to erasure — because it gives ownership directly to the people. In the case of metadata which is co-created, this is a tricky question.","We have to move down a path that reduces data generation and collection, because once the IoT (internet of things) ecosystem comes alive, the amount of data that is going to get generated about us is going to be nuts.","The data protection issue that we have today is a relationship between the collectors of data, which is large companies and states, and the creators of data. And the relationship is a power equation between them.","Should we worry about the 2019 elections being hacked?","I think it is a clear and present danger right now. I would now even question if the voter registry needs to be public information. This is why I keep pushing for the idea of data disarmament because our data is being weaponised against us. Therefore, our rights need to be supreme over the state and large platforms. Today it is Facebook, tomorrow it could be another company. Privacy is a fundamental right, and we need our rights to protect us."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

This was followed with a more in-depth analysis of the behavioural dynamics at work in key seats which in turn informed the party's efforts to ensure a local structure and communication strategy that matched the caste make-up and attitudinal positions of pre-identified 'swing population'.","2003 Rajasthan election","A major state party contracted SCL India to carry out two pieces of work, one internal and aimed at assessing the party's organisational strength (party audit), the other external and looking at the nature of the voting population and, more particularly, the attitudes and behaviours of politically-active individuals within the state. Both consisted of quantitive surveys followed by qualitative in-depth interviews, the product of which were analysed using the Behavioural Dynamics methodology, though the subject of enquiries and the implications for the party's strategic approach were naturally very different. SCL India also assisted the party in understanding how to use the diverse findings.","The India branch of SCL also did some psephological studies and behavioural polling in Delhi and Chhattisgarh, Wylie claimed.","Image Source : TWITTER/@CHRISINSILICO","According to the information shared by Wylie, one of key areas of research by SCL India for election strategies was 'Caste Research and Analysis'.

{"originalurl":"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1369_en.htm","title":"European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Mergers: Commission fines Facebook €110 million for providing misleading information about WhatsApp takeover","text":["The European Commission has fined Facebook €110 million for providing incorrect or misleading information during the Commission's 2014 investigation under the EU Merger Regulation of Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp.","Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Today's decision sends a clear signal to companies that they must comply with all aspects of EU merger rules, including the obligation to provide correct information. And it imposes a proportionate and deterrent fine on Facebook. The Commission must be able to take decisions about mergers' effects on competition in full knowledge of accurate facts.\"","The EU Merger Regulation obliges companies in a merger investigation to provide correct information that is not misleading as this is essential for the Commission to review mergers and takeovers in a timely and effective manner. This obligation applies, regardless of whether the information has an impact on the ultimate outcome of the merger assessment.","When Facebook notified the acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014, it informed the Commission that it would be unable to establish reliable automated matching between Facebook users' accounts and WhatsApp users' accounts. It stated this both in the notification form and in a reply to a request of information from the Commission. However, in August 2016, WhatsApp announced updates to its terms of service and privacy policy, including the possibility of linking WhatsApp users' phone numbers with Facebook users' identities.","The Commission has found that, contrary to Facebook's statements in the 2014 merger review process, the technical possibility of automatically matching Facebook and WhatsApp users' identities already existed in 2014, and that Facebook staff were aware of such a possibility.","Today's decision has no impact on the Commission's October 2014 decision to authorise the transaction under the EU Merger Regulation. Indeed, the clearance decision was based on a number of elements going beyond automated user matching. The Commission at the time also carried out an 'even if' assessment that assumed user matching as a possibility. The Commission therefore considers that, albeit relevant, the incorrect or misleading information provided by Facebook did not have an impact on the outcome of the clearance decision.","Moreover, today's decision is unrelated to either ongoing national antitrust procedures or privacy, data protection or consumer protection issues, which may arise following the August 2016 update of WhatsApp terms of service and privacy policy.","The fine","According to the Merger Regulation, the Commission can impose fines of up to 1% of the aggregated turnover of companies, which intentionally or negligently provide incorrect or misleading information to the Commission.","In setting the amount of a fine, the Commission takes into account the nature, the gravity and duration of the infringement, as well as any mitigating and aggravating circumstances.","Facebook committed two separate infringements by providing incorrect and misleading information in the merger notification form and in the reply to a Commission request for information. The Commission considers that these infringements are serious because they prevented it from having all relevant information for the assessment of the transaction.","Moreover, the Commission considers that Facebook staff were aware of the user matching possibility and that Facebook was aware of the relevance of user matching for the Commission's assessment, and of its obligations under the Merger Regulation. Therefore, Facebook's breach of procedural obligations was at least negligent. The Commission has also considered the existence of mitigating circumstances, notably the fact that Facebook cooperated with the Commission during the procedural infringement proceedings. In particular, in its reply to the Commission's Statement of Objections, Facebook acknowledged its infringement of the rules and waived its procedural rights to have access to the file and to an oral hearing. This allowed the Commission to conduct the investigation more efficiently. The Commission has taken Facebook's cooperation into account in setting the level of the fine.","On the basis of these factors, the Commission has concluded that an overall fine of €110 million is both proportionate and deterrent.","Background","This is the first time that the Commission has adopted a decision imposing fines on a company for provision of incorrect or misleading information since the entry into force of the 2004 Merger Regulation. Past Commission decisions in this regard were adopted under the 1989 Merger Regulation in accordance with different fine-setting rules.","The Facebook/WhatsApp merger case","In August 2014, Facebook, which is active in social networking, consumer communications and online non-search advertising services, notified the Commission of its plans to acquire the consumer communications services provider WhatsApp.","The Commission cleared the transaction on 3 October 2014, after assessing its impact on the internal market in relation to the following services:","(i) Consumer communications services: the Commission found that Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp were not close competitors and that consumers would continue to have a wide choice of alternative consumer communications apps post-merger. Although consumer communications apps are characterised by network effects, the investigation showed that a number of factors mitigated the network effects in this case.","(ii) Social networking services: the Commission concluded that, no matter what the precise boundaries of the market for social networking services are, and whether or not WhatsApp is considered a social network, the companies are distant competitors.","(iii) Online advertising: the Commission concluded that, regardless of whether Facebook would introduce advertising on WhatsApp and/or start collecting WhatsApp user data for advertising purposes, the transaction raised no competition concerns. This is because, besides Facebook, a number of alternative providers would continue to offer targeted advertising after the transaction, and a large amount of internet user data that are valuable for advertising purposes not within Facebook's exclusive control would continue to exist.","With respect to all three services the Commission carried out its competitive assessment also assuming a scenario where automated user matching would be possible. It concluded that, even in this scenario, its conclusions as to the lack of anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction would stand."],"isopubdate":"2017-05-18"}

(Justin Tallis/ AFP/Getty Images)","Reports surfaced this weekend about yet another Facebook-fueled abuse of privacy, this time by an outside company trying to manipulate voters on behalf of political causes and candidates — including Donald J. Trump in 2016. The revelations were both sadly familiar and newly outrageous.","According to the Guardian and the New York Times, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan produced an innocuous-looking personality testing app for Facebook whose real purpose was to identify the sorts of marketing pitches one might be susceptible to — ones that played to people's anxieties, for example, or alternatively to their sentiments. He then gathered data not just from the roughly 270,000 people who used the app, but from tens of millions of their Facebook friends, all without the friends' knowledge or consent, according to the news articles.","Advertisement","Whether the consent decree that Facebook signed in 2011 will have any bearing on this latest privacy affront remains to be seen.","Share quote & link","The story gets worse, however. Kogan reportedly turned over the Facebook data he had harvested to a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to help it build profiles that it could use to sway voters on a massive scale. The messages could be tailored precisely to the weaknesses of a narrow group of voters, and each pitch could be confined to a single group to avoid putting off voters with different sensibilities.","As Christopher Wylie, who worked at Cambridge Analytica from its founding until 2014, told the Guardian, \"We would know what kinds of messages you would be susceptible to, and where you're going to consume that. And then how many times do we need to touch you with that in order to change how you think about something.\"","Political campaigns and commercial advertisers have long sought to target their pitches; what's different now is how the internet and enormously popular platforms such as Facebook make the process easier, more effective, wider-scale and far more intrusive. Cambridge Analytica has denied using Facebook data improperly, but news reports over the weekend strongly suggest that the firm built its profiles at least in part with data Facebook users didn't realize they were sharing with it.","Kogan insists that he, too, did nothing wrong, and that's one of the most disturbing elements of the story. One reason he could acquire all that data about his app users' Facebook friends, including their posts and their likes, is because Facebook opened that information to application developers in 2011. The company rolled back access to information about app users' friends in 2015, long after Kogan harvested and shared that data.","Facebook says that when it first learned about Kogan's data sharing in 2015, it instructed his company and Cambridge Analytica to destroy the harvested data. If the latest news reports are true, a Facebook executive told the Guardian, \"it's a serious abuse\" of the company's rules.","That's little comfort to the millions of people whose marketing susceptibilities have now been cataloged with Facebook's help. And this is just the latest in a long line of privacy problems at the social network. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission entered into a settlement with the company in 2011 over misleading or false disclosures to users about app developers' access to data, among other issues.","Whether the consent decree that Facebook signed in 2011 will have any bearing on this latest privacy affront remains to be seen. Regardless, the fundamental problem here is that companies keep finding new and unanticipated ways to use the personal information people share online — including the digital bread crumbs they leave unwittingly as they wander around the web. Are you comfortable knowing that companies are scooping up your crumbs, your \"likes,\" your tweets, your status updates and your lists of friends to determine whether to offer you discounts? To decide which news items to show you? To determine how best to sell you on a controversial presidential candidate or a costly ballot measure?","The largely hands-off approach taken by regulators to date has encouraged bountiful innovation and experimentation, but it's also reinforced an act-first, ask-forgiveness-later mentality among entrepreneurs. The only guidelines are the vaguely worded prohibitions in federal law against unfair and deceptive practices; rather than trying to adopt comprehensive guidelines, the Federal Trade Commission has handled complaints on a case-by-case basis.","It's not enough. Internet users need some measure of control over the information they reveal online, so that they are not unwittingly helping countless unseen data brokers, aggregators and analysts find new and better ways to steer their opinions, purchases and votes. A federal bill of rights covering online data would be a good place to start. How many outrages have to surface before the tech industry and the federal government start taking privacy seriously?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn’t authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports “several days ago” that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook’s unusual public explanation of the move wasn’t clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large scale research project in the U.S.,” but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company. For the “avoidance of doubt,” the spokesman said, none of Kogan’s data was used in Cambridge Analytica’s 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign .","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Nix said Assange said no. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes. Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling."],"isopubdate":""}

The following year, that company, Eunoia Technologies, subsequently pitched Republican political operative Corey Lewandowski on microtargeting tools that could be deployed on behalf of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Emails from 2014 provided to BuzzFeed News show that Eunoia possessed a database of more than 50 million Facebook profiles at the time. That same information — and Facebook’s wider data collection policies in general — are now being scrutinized following reports by the New York Times and the Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired it from a company called Global Science Research (GSR), which originally collected it for academic purposes.","GSR, Cambridge Analytica, and Wylie said they have since deleted the data. Cambridge Analytica, which Donald Trump’s presidential campaign employed throughout 2016 to build ad-targeting profiles on potential voters, claimed in a statement Friday that none of the Facebook information in question was used for the election. And while there is no current indication Eunoia used the database or pitched it to Lewandowski, the fact that Wylie's little-known startup — which was a wholly distinct entity from Cambridge Analytica — possessed it at all is the latest in a string of revelations in Facebook's data crisis and further evidence that the company is unable to track how the personal profile information it collects is employed and distributed by third parties.","Other documents from Eunoia, which marketed ad microtargeting services to corporate and political clients, reveal that in the spring of 2015 Wylie’s startup pitched elections-related work to Trump’s eventual campaign manager, Lewandowski. One source, who declined to be named for fear of endangering personal and business relationships confirmed the authenticity of these documents; another person, who had direct knowledge of Eunoia’s meeting with Lewandowski, confirmed the Wylie-led startup’s interest in working for the fledgling Trump campaign.","Since blowing the whistle on Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, Wylie has said very little about Eunoia and his aspirations for it. He also has not spoken at all about his startup’s meeting with Lewandowski, who would go on to lead the Trump campaign. In response to BuzzFeed News’ questions about Eunoia last week, Wylie’s lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that her client “has not worked for Republican clients since leaving [Cambridge Analytica]” and that his company had “no data or assets.”","“Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets.”","The documents obtained by BuzzFeed and subsequent interviews with sources do not always cast Wylie in a flattering light, but they also do not call into question his claims about the improper transfer of Facebook user data to political consulting entities. After responding to an initial request for comment, Wylie's attorney went dark and did not answer the questions BuzzFeed News put to her Tuesday.","In a four-hour hearing of the UK Commons select committee on digital culture, media, and sport on Tuesday, Wylie was asked by committee chair Damian Collins if he had benefited from the GSR data set on other projects that he’d worked on outside of Cambridge Analytica.","“I didn’t do any contracts or do any, you know, work with that data,” Wylie replied. “I haven’t worked with any clients … That data got deleted, I believe, in 2015 on my end.”","“SCL Without Alexander Nix”","Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Wylie discussed plans to “build the NSA’s wet dream” in late 2013 while still working at Cambridge Analytica. “Our goal is first to make it an extremely profitable company,” he wrote in late 2013. “Then we will cleanse our souls with other projects, like using the data for good rather than evil. But evil pays more.\"","According to two people who knew Wylie at this time, the SCL microtargeting specialist had approached a number of colleagues about leaving their jobs to join him in a new company. According to one person, Wylie hoped to model his firm after Palantir Technologies, the CIA-backed, Silicon Valley data-mining company.","“He was very much trying to build this company and his vision was, ‘I want to build SCL without [Cambridge Analytica CEO] Alexander Nix,’” said one person who talked to Wylie about his new venture. Last week, Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix pending an investigation after he was recorded by the UK’s Channel 4 touting his firm’s ability to influence foreign elections and discussing techniques to entrap and blackmail political candidates. Cambridge Analytica did not return a request for comment.","By the beginning of 2014, Wylie had put together a presentation for a company called Arg.us. According to its pitch deck, which was seen and published in part by BuzzFeed News, the company said it could ingest users' social media activity to build “psychographic” profiles for marketers who could then target ads to specific users and possibly influence behavior. By the winter of that year, Wylie was having conversations about his idea with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including one who spoke to BuzzFeed News and received a note that said the products that Wylie had promised had been used for previous political clients.","Wylie’s lawyer previously said that Arg.us presentation was “never a serious pitch,” and it’s not clear how it was used. That said, similarities in documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News suggest it was a precursor to Eunoia.","After leaving Cambridge Analytica and SCL in late June of 2014, Wylie pivoted his focus to Eunoia — Greek for “beautiful thinking” — formulating a company that could perform so-called psychographic modeling and targeting for its clients. By August, he was working at Eunoia with Tobias Kloepper, a one-time SCL data scientist who would obtain Facebook data for the young startup. Emails viewed by BuzzFeed News indicate that Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist and founder of GSR, shared a database of more than 50 million Facebook users with Kloepper.","Kogan and Kloepper did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unclear if Wylie ever used that data, with the whistleblower noting in front of a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that he eventually deleted it because “I wasn’t going to do anything with it.”","Correspondence between Wylie and an acquaintance from September 2014 show that, while Wylie was particularly interested in courting fashion industry clients, he claimed to also have meetings with Monsanto, the American Petroleum Institute, and Ford. A Eunoia fashion-focused presentation from the time obtained by BuzzFeed News said the company had a “database that contains the information of hundreds of millions of individual consumers with emails, Facebook/Twitter IDs and mailing addresses,” while a separate company brochure specifically discusses targeting voters for potential political clients. Neither document mentions the specific GSR data set of 50 million Facebook users, and it’s unclear if Eunoia ever put that data to use.","“The heart of our work stems from a rigorous scientific understanding of human behavior, which in turn allows us to engineer more responsive audiences and engage consumers more precisely,” read the brochure. “To do this, we have developed a series of algorithms that can predict the personality traits of individual voters by analyzing their voterfile [sic], social, online and consumer data.”","Neither the presentation nor the brochure mention the provenance of that \"social, online and consumer data.\"","Provided to BuzzFeed News","A presentation slide for fashion clients from Eunoia Technologies.","According to one person, GSR gave its data to Eunoia after Kogan had negotiated an agreement where the startup would receive the information without charge as part of a data-sharing agreement between the two parties. Wylie never provided Kogan with data of his own, this person said, and GSR moved to cancel its agreements with Eunoia in early 2015. Eunoia appears to never have officially launched; a separate source told BuzzFeed News that it was unable to secure funding.","Data On The Loose","The contested data set, which GSR harvested using a 2014 Facebook personality quiz where users permitted the app to obtain personal information about themselves and their friends, has kick-started investigations from governments around the world. In the US, multiple members of Congress have asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill about the social network’s data policies and how the information of more than 50 million users could have ended up in the hands of a company doing elections consulting work.","As BuzzFeed News has learned, the spread of the Facebook data was not confined to Cambridge Analytica. Wylie may have had access to the data set for more than a year after founding Eunoia, with Facebook only acting to address the violation of its rules in late 2015, after the release of a story in the Guardian. GSR was told to delete its data in December 2015, according to a source, while Wylie said in testimony in front a parliamentary committee Tuesday that he believed he deleted the GSR data “some time in 2015” after being contacted by Kogan.","Earlier this month, after learning that several outlets were working on stories about the Trump campaign–hired data analysis company, the social networking giant moved to suspend the Facebook accounts of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, and Wylie. Facebook declined to comment for this story.","\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post last Wednesday. He added that the company would investigate “all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014.” The company took out full-page ads in several newspapers last Sunday apologizing for the mistake.","Asked last week if Eunoia had used any data sets on Facebook users, Wylie’s lawyer, Allen, was adamant. “Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets,” she wrote.","Provided to BuzzFeed News","Eunoia business cards","Eunoia And Trump’s Campaign Manager","In an interview with NBC’s Today show last week, Wylie drew a line between Cambridge Analytica and Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “What I do know is that Cambridge Analytica was meeting with Corey Lewandowski in 2015 before Trump had even announced and offering the services that I’m talking about right now,” he said.","What Wylie didn’t say is that Eunoia Technologies also met with Lewandowski around the same time. According to one source, Lewandowski met with representatives of the company, including Tadas Jucikas, a former SCL employee, and Mark Gettleson, Eunoia’s communications and marketing strategist, around Easter Sunday 2015 in the lobby of a New York Central Park hotel. Wylie did not attend the meeting, said the person, but he was well aware of it and its purpose to discuss voter microtargeting for a possible presidential candidate.","Drew Angerer / Getty Images","Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski arrives at Trump Tower in December 2016 in New York City.","While Trump’s campaign went on to work with Cambridge Analytica later in 2016, the person said that Lewandowski met with Eunoia, in part, because the Alexander Nix operation was already working for Ted Cruz’s presidential election team at the time. According to that source, that meeting included “high-level discussions” about microtargeting techniques and did not include any talk about Facebook data.","Jucikas declined to comment. Gettleson did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including phone calls, emails, and a visit to his London home. Lewandowski, who became Trump’s official campaign manager when the billionaire announced his candidacy in June 2015, did not respond to a request for comment.","Emails obtained by BuzzFeed News further corroborate the pitch to the Trump campaign. In April 2015, following the meeting with Lewandowski, Gettleson, a political operative with UK’s liberal democratic party, sent an email with the subject line “Trump” to a graphic designer who had been designing business cards and brochures for the company. The email included an attachment labeled “Trump-Handout,” which contained a list of various political microtargeting products and services offered by the company. The graphic designer made a few adjustments to the document and placed its contents on official Eunoia stationery before sending it back to Gettleson in a PDF called “eunioa_stationary_introletter.” It’s unclear if these documents were then sent to Lewandowski or if Eunoia had any further meetings with Trump’s eventual campaign manager.","A cache of documents sent to BuzzFeed News by a source, which included business contracts and pitch decks, reveal other individuals who, to varying degrees, were associated with the fledgling startup. Many of those people did not want to talk about their involvement with the company or did not return BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment. Ray Larson, a former strategist for Canada’s liberal party, did not respond to emails and a phone message; Brent Clickard, a former colleague of Wylie’s at SCL declined to comment. A source close to Clickard said that while he spoke with Wylie about working at Eunoia, the pair never formalized an agreement.","Alfredas Chmieliauskas, a London-based employee of Palantir, said he had “no idea” why his name was on Eunoia’s business documents, adding that while Wylie knew “a former school friend of mine ... we never had a working relationship of any sort.” On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Chmieliauskas, while at Palantir, began corresponding with Wylie in 2013 and later gave him the idea to develop the quiz app, eventually employed by Kogan, to harvest Facebook user data. Wylie also visited with Palantir, with a company spokesperson later confirming that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica considered working together at one point.","Correspondence from Wylie that was given to BuzzFeed News show Wylie bragging to an acquaintance in late 2013 about the prospect of someone from Palantir wanting to join his idea for a startup.","It is not clear if these people, who denied having official work relationships with Eunoia or did not reply altogether, knew that the company had access to a data set with more than 50 million Facebook users or that its associates were meeting with potential presidential campaigns.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record.\"","According to a source, Eunoia also sought to hire Mark Block, the former chief of staff to 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain who had a brief spell of notoriety for smoking a cigarette in a campaign ad. Block’s name and that of his associate, Linda Hansen, were printed on a proof sheet of draft Eunoia business cards given to BuzzFeed News by a second source.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record,” Block said when asked about his relationship with Eunoia and Wylie. Block, who reportedly introduced Steve Bannon to SCL and worked for the company’s elections division as its head of US sales, according to an archived version of SCL’s website, declined to say anything more.","\"There were discussions about politics and some other ex [Cambridge Analytica] staff wanted to continue working in Republican politics,\" Wylie's lawyer said in an email to earlier questions last week. \"However they parted ways with Mr Wylie to set up their own company that does work for Republican clients. ... Mr Wylie has not worked for Republicans since leaving CA and does not wish to in the future.\""],"isopubdate":""}

His office also sent the letter to the UK and Irish national data protection authorities.","TheObserver and The New York Times reported on Saturday (17 March) that Cambridge Analytica may have illegally taken information from 50 million Facebook profiles and used it to influence the two political campaigns without informing the users.","The Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum and the Trump presidential campaign were both Cambridge Analytica clients, according to those reports.","The UK data protection authority is already investigating the incident.","On Monday, the British data protection chief Elizabeth Denham said, “A full understanding of the facts, data flows and data uses is imperative for my ongoing investigation. This includes any new information, statements or evidence that have come to light in recent days.”","Facebook’s European headquarters is in Ireland.","According to a whistleblower who worked at Cambridge Analytica, Facebook know about the company’s use of the data for two years but did not report it to users.","Tajani said in a statement, “This incident is more than a breach of data, it’s a breach of trust that can threaten the very functioning of democracy.”","Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg attempted to woo a team of four EU Commissioners during closed-door meetings Tuesday (23 January) on tense issues like hate speech and online platform transparency.","Facebook denied over the weekend that the incident amounted to a full-blown data breach—which would legally require the company to alert authorities about how private data was compromised.","The social media firm said over the weekend that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica’s account. In a statement on Saturday, the data analytics firm said that it complies with Facebook’s service terms and did not illegally harvest users’ profile data.","The European Commission also put pressure on Facebook to answer questions about its knowledge of the incident.","EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova will meet with Facebook representatives during a visit to Washington this week. Her trip was already planned to meet with US government officials including Secretary of Commerce WIlbur Ross and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but Jourova’s office rushed to arrange the meeting with Facebook on Sunday after the allegations surfaced about the firm’s knowledge of the data harvesting.","She departed for Washington on Monday. In a tweet on Sunday, she described the incident as “horrifying, if confirmed”.","“From a European Union perspective, the misuse for political purposes of personal data belonging to Facebook users – if confirmed – is not acceptable. In the EU, data protection is a fundamental right. As a rule, personal data cannot be used without the consent of the person concerned,” Commission spokesman Christian Wigand said.","Wigand said Jourova would raise the issue in meetings with US government officials.","In a rare move that highlighted the Commission’s concern, Jourova also asked the so-called article 29 working party, the umbrella group of national data protection authorities from EU countries, to open an investigation into the incident. The Commission does not have its own power to sanction companies that break EU data protection law.","The justice chief has already been in contact with the national authorities.","The data protection watchdogs can coordinate their national investigations into potential breaches of EU data protection law, and can fine companies separately if they are caught breaking the rules.","But in May, a stricter new EU data protection law will come into effect and give national authorities’ offices an arsenal of tougher powers. They will be able to launch EU-wide investigations into data protection violations and raise record-high fines of up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global turnover.","Europe’s powerful data protection regulators are banding together to coordinate how they investigate and sanction misbehaving companies before a major overhaul of the bloc’s privacy law takes effect in May."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

It was the late 1990s, and the political advertising operative had an idea about using a relatively newfangled tool – banner ads on web sites – to promote political candidates. “It was pretty clear to me at the time that the ability to target and tailor messaging was perfect for political campaigns,” Gould recalled recently. “I did a whole presentation on the internet and the power to connect, track, do fundraising, target.”","But when Gould finished his pitches, he would be met with blank stares. “I was a very lonely pied piper,” he says.","Finally, in 1998, Gould found a political candidate who was so far behind in the polls, and so strapped for cash, that he was willing to take a risk and spend $100,000 on banner ads on the New York Times homepage. Peter Vallone, then a New York City council member challenging George Pataki for the governorship, gave Gould the green light for an ad buy that has since entered the history books as the first significant use of online advertising in a political campaign.","The ads themselves are lost to internet history – Gould believes he may have copies somewhere on floppy discs. But it’s not hard to draw a line from that moment to Robert Mueller’s 16 February indictment of the Internet Research Agency, which alleges that Russian agents carried out a conspiracy to interfere with a US presidential election, in large part by purchasing targeted Facebook ads designed to “encourage US minority groups not to vote”.Or to the news recently revealed in the Observer that 50m Facebook profiles were obtained and misused by data mining company Cambridge Analytica to target voters during the 2016 presidential election.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","The Vallone ads contained rudimentary versions of many of the attributes that make digital advertising such a powerful – and terrifying – force today: the ability to target specific audiences with tailored messages, then track their reaction.","“Come November 2000, I expect the question will no longer be whether web-based political advertising works,” wrote Cyrus Krohn, then the manager of political advertising for the Microsoft Network, in a prescient 1999 column for Slate, “but whether it works too well.”","Nearly 20 years later, the world has caught up to Krohn’s concerns, with some critics making the not entirely hyperbolic argument that micro-targeted “dark advertising” on Facebook is a fundamental threat to democracy itself. Is it too late for democracy to fix itself?","Parscale had been a little-known digital marketing executive working out of Texas when he was tapped to build Trump’s campaign website in 2015. Until then, digital advertising was barely a rounding error in campaign budgets. In 2008, the year Barack Obama became the first social media candidate, candidates spent just $22.25m on online political ads, according to an analysis by Borrell Associates. That number grew significantly in 2012, but the real explosion came in 2016, when campaigns pumped $1.4bn into digital ads.","US presidential campaigns are often remembered – and understood – by their advertisements. Lyndon B Johnson’s “Daisy” ad powerfully (and controversially) set the stakes of an election in a nuclear world. George HW Bush’s “Willie Horton” attack ad still epitomizes the racist dog-whistle politics of the tough-on-crime era. The message, as much as the messenger, is a key part of the debate over who is best equipped to lead the country.","But no such public debate took place around Trump’s apparently game-changing digital political advertisements before election day.","This is partly due to a loophole in the prevailing campaign finance law, which was written in 2002 and did not include internet ads in the class of regulated “electioneering communications”. But perhaps even more important is the very nature of online advertising, which is self-serve (just sign up with a credit card and go) and highly iterative.","Parscale claims he typically ran 50,000 to 60,000 variations of Facebook ads each day during the Trump campaign, all targeting different segments of the electorate. Understanding the meaning of a single one of those ads would require knowing what the ad actually said, who the campaign targeted to see that ad, and how that audience responded. Multiply that by 100 and you have a headache; by 50,000 and you’ll start to doubt your grasp on reality. Then remember that this is 50,000 a day over the course of a campaign that lasted more than a year.","“The reason I said it might work too well,” Krohn said in a recent interview with the Guardian, “is that mass marketing went away and micro-targeting – nano-targeting – came to fruition.”","Any candidate using Facebook can put a campaign message promising one thing in front of one group of voters while simultaneously running an ad with a completely opposite message in front of a different group of voters. The ads themselves are not posted anywhere for the general public to see (this is what’s known as “dark advertising”), and chances are, no one will ever be the wiser.","Trump digital director says Facebook helped win the White House","Read more","That undermines the very idea of a “marketplace of ideas”, says Ann Ravel, a former member of the Federal Election Commission who has long advocated stricter regulations on digital campaigning. “The way to have a robust democracy is for people to hear all these ideas and make decisions and discuss,” Ravel said. “With microtargeting, that is not happening.”","Parscale and his staff told reporters with Bloomberg that they used Facebook ads to target Hillary Clinton supporters with messages designed to make them sit the election out, including her own forays into dog-whistle politics from the 1990s, which the Trump campaign hoped would discourage black voters from turning out to the polls.","That degree of political manipulation might be unsavory, but it’s also relatively old-fashioned. One digital campaign staffer (not affiliated with the Trump campaign) compared it to Richard Nixon’s Southern Strategy, only “technologically savvy”.","But new reporting by the Observer has revealed that the data analytics team that worked for Trump, Cambridge Analytica, went far beyond Nixonian dirty tricks. The firm obtained Facebook data harvested under the auspices of an academic study, the Observer has revealed, and then used that data to target millions of US voters based on their psychological weaknesses.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Observer about the data theft, “and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.”","European elections","Political advertising in the US is the wild west compared with other western democracies, which tend to have shorter election campaigns with strict regulations on the amount and type of spending permitted. Such rules may enhance the impact of digital advertising, which is much cheaper than television and largely unregulated.","The UK has seen a rapid shift to digital campaigning following the Conservative party’s embrace of Facebook in the 2015 general election. The Tories outspent Labour by a factor of 10 on Facebook advertisements, a decision that many political observers saw as decisive. In a country that bans political ads on television, Facebook enabled the Conservatives to reach 80.65% of users in targeted constituencies with its promoted posts and video ads, according to marketing materials created by Facebook. (At some point in the past year, the company began hiding previously produced “Success Stories” about its ability to sway election results.)","The Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum went on to spend almost its entire budget on Facebook advertising, an investment that resulted in about 1bn targeted digital ads being served to voters over the course of a 10-week campaign.","Though it is impossible to parse the exact impact of Facebook advertisements amid all the other factors that shape an electoral result (including organic Facebook content), the platform is increasingly cited as a factor in the growing electoral might of far-right groups in Europe.","Supporters of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party demonstrate outside the Chancellery in Berlin last week. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images","The radical right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party reportedly worked with a US campaign consultancy and Facebook itself to target German voters susceptible to its anti-immigrant message during the 2017 election in which AfD surged in popularity to become the third-largest party in parliament.","Campaigning in Italy’s recent election, which saw the rise of anti-establishment parties, including the populist Five Star Movement and the far-right League, largely took place on social media. Facebook advertisements and targeting information gathered by Italian transparency group Openpolis found that the neo-fascist Brothers of Italy party ran a Facebook ad targeting Italian adults who are interested in the paramilitary police force, the carabinieri.","After the polls closed in Italy, the League’s Matteo Salvini shared some words of gratitude with the press: “Thank God for the internet. Thank God for social media. Thank God for Facebook.”","Targeting the midterms","While investigations into the 2016 US election and Brexit referendum continue, it’s worth remembering that more elections are fast approaching. Scores of countries will hold national elections in 2018, including Sweden, Ireland, Egypt, Mexico and Brazil.","In the US, candidates for the 435 congressional and 35 Senate seats that are up for grabs in November are already running campaigns on Facebook, and we may never know what they’re saying in those advertisements.","Take, for example, Paul Nehlen, a candidate who is running a Republican primary challenge against the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, in Wisconsin. Nehlen is primarily known as a vehement antisemite who was once embraced by Steve Bannon and the Breitbart wing of the right, but was excommunicated after appearing on a white supremacist podcast.","They’ve built this incredibly powerful platform that allows very narrow targeting ... so that scares me","Alan Mislove, professor","According to his FEC filings, Nehlen spent at least $2,791.72 on Facebook ads in the final six months of 2017.","What did that money buy?","In the first instance, everything that any Facebook advertiser can get: access to one of the most powerful databases of personal information that has ever existed, with insights into individuals’ intimate relationships, political beliefs, consumer habits and internet browsing.","Beyond that, we don’t know. Nehlen could be using Facebook to target likely voters in his district with a message about infrastructure. Or he could have taken a list of his own core supporters (he has more than 40,000 likes on Facebook), used Facebook’s “lookalike audience” tool to find other people inclined to support his particular politics, then fed them ads designed to persuade more people to join him in hating Jews.","Last fall, after Facebook had been forced to admit that, despite its initial denials, its platform had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the election, the company announced a set of reforms designed to assuage its critics – and stave off actual, enforceable regulation.","Starting this summer, the platform has promised that every political ad will be linked back to the page that paid for it. The pages themselves will display every ad that they’re running, as well as demographic information about the audience that they are reaching, a measure that Mark Zuckerberg claimed would “bring Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency” than the law requires for television or other media.","A version of these reforms is already live in Canada, where users can see all the ads being run by a political candidate in a designated tab on their page.","But there is good reason to be skeptical.","Since 2014, Facebook has had a transparency tool for all ads served on the platform. Click on the upper right-hand corner of a Facebook ad and you’ll see an option reading “Why am I seeing this ad?” Click through and you’ll get an explanation of the characteristics that make you desirable to the advertiser.","So far so good, but a new study by computer scientists found that Facebook’s ad explanations were “often incomplete and sometimes misleading” in a way that “may allow malicious advertisers to easily obfuscate ad explanations that are discriminatory or that target privacy-sensitive attributes”.","Alan Mislove, a professor of computer science at Northeastern University and one of the study’s co-authors, said that he gave Facebook credit for having the feature at all, noting that it is one of the only examples of a company offering any kind of explanation of how an algorithm actually works. But the findings do not paint a particularly pretty picture of Facebook’s ability to self-regulate.","“They’ve built this incredibly powerful platform that allows very narrow targeting, a very powerful tool that anyone on the internet can use, so that scares me,” Mislove said. “And up until very recently, there was very little accountability. You as a malicious actor on Facebook don’t even really need to obfuscate your behavior, because the only person watching is Facebook.”","Honest Ads Act","The best hope for bringing some order to the realm of digital political ads is through updating US law for the Facebook era.","A bipartisan proposal to do just that exists. In October, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner and John McCain introduced the Honest Ads Act, which would close the loophole that allows internet ads to avoid regulation, and also require internet platforms (ie Facebook and Google) to maintain a public file of all the political ads they run and who paid for them.","But as much as we need transparency around political ads to maintain democracy, we also need a functioning democracy to get that transparency. And it’s not clear that it’s not already too late.","“In an ideal world, with a fully functioning Congress, there would be hearings around the Honest Ads Act, and you would have Facebook and Google and Twitter and experts testify to shine a light on the nature of political advertising,” said Brendan Fischer, director of FEC reform at the Campaign Legal Center. “We’re not close to that at all.”","In the absence of a fully functioning Congress, what is to be done? Should we expect Facebook to simply stop selling political ads?","Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former product manager for Facebook who helped develop its advertising toolssays that he has come to realize that political ads are simply a different beast than commercial ones, which can and should be treated differently by his former employer.","“Selling shoes needs to be different than selling politicians, even though the mechanics of it are identical,” he said. “Morally it’s different.”","Or should we pressure Facebook to stop allowing candidates with hateful or extremist views to use its tools?","“If we farm these important democratic responsibilities out to a private company, today they might be regulating antisemitism, but tomorrow they’re regulating what people can say about the Honest Ads Act,” Fischer said.","Indeed, Facebook could already be suppressing political views unfavorable to its business practices, and we would have no way of knowing. It’s possible Facebook wouldn’t even know. In response to queries about inconsistent moderation of clothing advertisements, a Facebook spokeswoman recently told the New York Times that “the company could not ask an automated system about [its] decisions”.","Frankenstein’s monster is not under any human’s control.","No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","Read more","If this all seems positively dystopian, one person who is surprisingly sanguine is Alan Gould.","Gould left politics soon after the Vallone campaign, founded an advertising analytics firm, sold it, and is now a tech investor. He does have concerns about media literacy and Facebook’s tendency to trap people in filter bubbles, but says: “If people choose to stay in that bubble and not explore anything outside of it, that’s a statement about who they are and not about the technology.","“If you’re going to have a representative democracy, then you have to have a way to communicate with the voters and you’re going to use whatever is available, whether that’s newspapers or mail or email or Snapchat,” he said. “I don’t regret it at all.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Maybe think twice.","UpdatedUpdated 19 March","By\nKelsey Munro","Share","What happened?","Data firm Cambridge Analytica is fast becoming a house-hold name after two media outlets revealed its involvement in Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica has been accused of harvesting the data of some 50 million Facebook users' profiles without their knowledge to help it design software to predict and influence voters’ choices at the ballot box.","Just hours before the Observer and the New York Times broke the story over the weekend, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform, pending an investigation, in an apparent pre-emptive strike to limit the damage to its own brand.","The tech giant has announced a review into the potential privacy breach as it comes under intense scrutiny by US and British politcians. Cambridge Analytica, meanwhile, has said it deleted the data before it even started work on the Trump campaign.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix will now face another grilling by British politicians, while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned to speak to a UK House of Commons committee about the misuse of data.","Why do we care?","Well, because so many of us are on Facebook, which has built its entire massive business on its users’ data - their likes, networks, locations and browsing histories. Facebook is free to you, because you are not the customer but the product. Your data, aggregated with millions of others', is an incredibly powerful tool for anyone who wants to convince a lot of people to vote for someone or buy something.","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.","Christopher Wylie","In the words of Christopher Wylie, the Canadian data analytics specialist and whistle-blower that created the system and now, deeply troubled by its consequences, has exposed it: “I built Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindf--k tool.” Steve Bannon was the driving force behind the election of Donald Trump, one of the most disruptive and controversial presidents in US history.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" Wylie told the Observer.","This appears to be the starkest example yet of how social media is being used for political purposes at the highest levels.","How did it work?","The New York Times reports that Cambridge Analytica spent US$800,000 in 2014 to get Russian-American academic Aleksandr Kogan to build an app to harvest the data of Facebook users. He created a personality quiz called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it. 270,000-odd people downloaded the app.","According to Facebook, users consent for their information to be used simply by downloading the app, but media reports said it also extracted the personal data of each of those users’ friends, unbeknown to them.","Aleksandr Kogan then passed all the data his app collected on some 50 million users onto Cambridge Analytica and other companies. Of those accounts, sufficient data had been gleaned to create psychographic profiles on 30 million of them, which it used to understand and influence voter behaviour for its clients.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 when it learned of the violations, and told everyone who received the misappropriated data to destroy it. But it has now emerged from several sources speaking to several media outlets that the data had not been deleted.","Facebook has since pushed back a bit, quibbling that it was “not a data breach.” The tech giant's deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said in the company’s statement that all misused data was “knowingly provided” by users, and did not extend to those users’ Facebook friends - or at least not to those who had privacy settings turned on.","But Facebook has suspended it anyway because it violated Facebook’s rules when the data was handed to a third party - Cambridge Analytica - for targeting political ads.","Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned over data breach.","AFP Karen Bleier","Who is Cambridge Analytica?","Set up in London in 2013, Cambridge Analytica purports to help its clients “change audience behaviour” using consumer data from social media and polling combined with behavioural science. Its right wing founder Alexander Nix told the website Contagious that it was set up “to address the vacuum in the US Republican political market” after Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat.","\"It is sort of like the digital shadow of yourself. So, when you think about what you do on social media, you curate your identity.\"","\"Cambridge Analytica will try to pick at whatever mental weakness or vulnerability that we think you have and try to warp your perception of what's real around you,\" he said.","The firm was bankrolled to the tune of $15 million by US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, a major Republican donor. At the time, Steve Bannon - a top Trump adviser until he was fired last summer - was a director of the company.","Following the suspension on the weekend, the company said it was in touch with Facebook \"in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible ,\" denying it violated Facebook’s terms of service. It blamed the misuse of data on Aleksandr Kogan and said it has since deleted all the data it received from a company he founded, Global Science Research.","What is the Trump connection?","Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had boasted that he brought in Cambridge Analytica to help win the 2016 US Presidential election for Mr Trump, according to the New York Times. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia during the election, thinks the company could be a key link in his case. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Mr Mueller has ordered Cambridge Analytica to turn over internal documents.","The company has sought quickly to hose down the Trump connection, claiming that none of the data obtained through Kogan and Global Science Research “was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","But Robert Mueller is not expected to let this one go.","What does this mean for Facebook users?","The compromise of 50 million users’ data raises a lot of questions over whether, as Facebook said in its statement: “protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do.” The company was already under fire over the way its news feed was effectively gamed to spread deliberate misinformation deployed by Russian interests to sway voters during the 2016 US election campaign - another huge blow to its reputation.","Facebook has not informed users whose data was compromised of the fact. Going forward, even if third party apps obtain users' data legitimately according to Facebook's own rules, they may then be acquired by other companies who use it, in breach of the rules.","So the social media platform’s 2.2 billion users may well be wondering how safe their data is, and whether the company has undertaken any systemic action to stop misuse when it has clearly known about this problem for a few years, but only acted on Friday ahead of media exposure.","What happens now?","In the UK, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are already the subject of an inquiry into data and politics by the Information Commissioner’s Office and another one by the Electoral Commission to investigate what role it played in the Brexit referendum (the company has said it did not work for the ‘Leave’ vote, but this has been contradicted by the co-founder of Leave.EU, Arron Banks).","In the US, Democrat senators called for new regulations on Facebook over the weekend, and some Republican senators questioned the company’s actions. But it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would act. Facebook said it was conducting a thorough internal review.","Australian connection","The data mining firm has been trying to expand its operations overseas, including in Australia. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Australia at a property in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra; however, the man who registered the firm said it has never conducted any business here.","But in April 2017, Senator Dan Tehan was among a group of Liberal politicians who met an executive from Cambridge Analytica. In a brief statement issued on Monday, the Liberal Party said it was not using the firm."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

How'd you manage that one?Zuck: People just submitted it.Zuck: I don't know why.Zuck: They \"trust me\"Zuck: Dumb fucks.","Since Facebook launched, the company has faced one privacy flap after another, usually following changes to the privacy policy or new product releases. To its credit, the company has often modified its products based on such feedback. As the pioneer in a huge new market, Facebook will take heat for everything it does. It has also now grown into a $22 billion company run by adults who know that their future depends on Facebook users trusting the site's privacy policy.","But the company's attitude toward privacy, as reflected in Mark's early emails and IMs, features like Beacon and Instant Personalization, and the frequent changes to the privacy policy, has been consistently aggressive: Do something first, then see how people react.","And this does appear to reflect Mark's own views of privacy, which seem to be that people shouldn't care about it as much as they do -- an attitude that very much reflects the attitude of his generation.","After all, here's what early Facebook engineering boss, Harvard alum, and Zuckerberg confidant Charlie Cheever said in David Kirkpatrick's brilliantly-reported upcoming book The Facebook Effect.","Again in Kirkpatrick's book, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg puts it this way:","\"Mark really does believe very much in transparency and the vision of an open society and open world, and so he wants to push people that way.

His administration, with help from Republicans in Congress, has often targeted environmental rules it sees as overly burdensome to the fossil fuel industry, including major Obama-era policies aimed at fighting climate change.","The Environmental Protection Agency has been involved in more than a third of the policy reversals identified by The Times. Scott Pruitt, the head of the E.P.A. who spearheaded the administration’s agenda of environmental deregulation, resigned after facing a number of ethics scandals. Andrew Wheeler, the new acting chief of the agency, is a former coal lobbyist who also wants to roll back environmental regulations.","Rules targeted for reversal so far include key Obama-era efforts to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, as well as broader air and water pollution controls and protections for threatened animals and habitats. The Trump administration has, in many instances, pared back these regulations in favor of more expansive energy extraction policies — often as a direct response to petitions from oil, gas and coal companies. Mr. Trump has argued that supporting the fossil fuel industry strengthens the economy.","The list above represents two types of policy changes: rules that have been officially reversed and those still in progress. Other rules, summarized at the bottom of this page, were undone but later reinstated after legal challenges.","The process of rolling back regulations has not always been smooth, in part because the administration has in some cases skipped steps like notifying the public and asking for comment. In several cases, courts have been asked to intervene to get agencies to follow their own policies.","All told, the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks could lead to at least 80,000 extra deaths per decade and cause respiratory problems for more than one million people, according to a recent analysis conducted by researchers from Harvard University. That number, however, is likely to be “a major underestimate of the global public health impact,” said Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health.","Air pollution and emissions","Overturned","2.\nLoosened a Clinton-era rule designed to limit toxic emissions from major industrial polluters.\nE.P.A.\n|\nRead more","3.\nDirected agencies to stop using an Obama-era calculation of the “social cost of carbon” that rulemakers used to estimate the long-term economic benefits of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\nExecutive Order\n|\nRead more","4.\nRevoked a 2015 rule that prohibited the use of hydrofluorocarbons – powerful greenhouse gases – as a replacement for ozone-depleting substances.\nE.P.A.\n|\nRead more","5.\nRepealed a requirement that state and regional authorities track tailpipe emissions from vehicles traveling on federal highways.\nTransportation Department\n|\nRead more","6.\nWithdrew guidance for federal agencies to include greenhouse gas emissions in environmental reviews.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

He's also the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica.","\"It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country, without their consent or awareness.\"","The reports provided many details about the whistleblower who in 2007 or 2008 landed his first political gig with the federal Liberals.","At age 17, he worked in the office of Canada's opposition leader, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stéphane Dion, said one of the reports. When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama's campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn't heard of Wylie — or they barely remembered him.","\"I vaguely recall him,\" wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. \"I think that he was a summer intern.\"","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was \"pretty junior\" and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn't know Wylie well, they remembered him as a \"big advocate of microtargeting.\"","Liberal Party insists it doesn't sell information","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama's campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ. The firm has come under scrutiny in Britain for its possible role in helping the Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum.","Asked about Wylie, Canada's Liberal Party said in a statement Sunday that protecting the information of Canadians it engages with is a \"foremost priority.\"","Christopher Wylie told CBC News that Cambridge Analytica targeted millions of Americans during the election campaign without their knowledge based on psychological profiles and surveys. (Lily Martin/CBC)","The party said it has a clear, stringent policy that protects individuals' private information. It also said its agreements with campaign partners also include strict requirements.","The party insists it doesn't sell information under any circumstances.","A spokeswoman for Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said Sunday that social media platforms have a responsibility to help ensure citizens and the democratic processes are protected from \"threats like foreign interference, data breaches, hate speech, and misinformation.\"","\"While some social media platforms have begun to take initial steps to address these issues, it's clear that much more needs to be done,\" Jordan Owens wrote in an email.","Owens said the government would work with social media firms to ensure they respect and help preserve the integrity of Canada's democracy.","Facebook said in a weekend blog post that claims the harvesting of user information was a data breach are \"completely false.\"","The statement said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his Facebook app.","\"People knowingly gave their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" said the post by Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice-president and deputy general counsel.","External Links","Popular Now","Comments","To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

The websites are stripped of photos and videos and can be browsed without paying for mobile data.","Facebook sees this as an “on-ramp” to using the open internet: by introducing people to a taster of the internet, they will see the value in paying for data, which in turn brings more people online and can help improve their lives.","However, the Global Voices report identifies a number of weaknesses in the service, including not adequately serving the linguistic needs of local populations; featuring a glut of third-party services from private companies in the US; harvesting huge amounts of metadata about users and violating the principles of net neutrality.","“Facebook is not introducing people to open internet where you can learn, create and build things,” said Ellery Biddle, advocacy director of Global Voices. “It’s building this little web that turns the user into a mostly passive consumer of mostly western corporate content. That’s digital colonialism.”","To deliver the service, which is now active in 65 countries, Facebook partners with local mobile operators. Mobile operators agree to “zero-rate” the data consumed by the app, making it free, while Facebook does the technical heavy lifting to ensure that they can do this as cheaply as possible. Each version is localized, offering a slightly different set of up to 150 sites and services.","But many of the services with the most prominent placement – on the app’s homepage - are created by private US companies, regardless of the market. These include AccuWeather, Johnson & Johnson-owned BabyCenter, BBC News, ESPN and the search engine Bing. There are no other social networking sites apart from Facebook and no email provider.","Alongside them are country-specific offerings, but their presence is determined by which companies have adapted their code to meet the requirements of the Free Basics platform, rather than those that meet local needs.","“The content does not include some of the important websites Ghanaians want to look at,” said Kofi Yeboah, who researched the app in Ghana, noting that popular news websites such as MyJoyOnline and CityFM were missing.","In the Mexican version of the app, offered by Telcel, there’s only one local site on the first page: for the foundation of the billionaire Carlos Slim, the CEO of Telcel. Bizarrely, the same app also offers two Nigerian websites and a regional news outlet for Argentina.","Free Basics is also restricted in terms of language. Kenyan users can choose an interface in English or Kiswahili, but most of the services are offered in English only. In Ghana, everything is in English, even though other languages, such as Twi and Hausa, are widely spoken.","When a user tries to access information outside of the tiny walled garden, a pop-up appears urging them to buy more data. For example, although Free Basics includes access to the Bing search engine and will show snippets of listings for free, reading any of the results of the search requires payment. On Facebook, this means people can see links to news and blogposts but can’t read them.","“This means people are reacting to articles through clickbait headlines only and not by reading the whole article. It makes it difficult to detect fake news,” said Mong Palatino, who studied the Philippines version.","This is particularly jarring given the way that Free Basics as advertised.","“The advertising implies that it’s free internet, but then you actually use it and it’s not really the full internet,” said Palatino. “It misleads the public and makes them think these sites and services are the essential tools.”","The promotion of certain sites and services through zero-rating the data also infringes on net neutrality, the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat everyone’s data equally to prevent a tiered system, in which some content providers have an unfair advantage.","Facebook worker living in garage to Zuckerberg: challenges are right outside your door","“Arguments about net neutrality shouldn’t be used to prevent the most disadvantaged people in society from gaining access or to deprive people of opportunity,” he said on his Facebook profile in 2015.","It’s an argument that doesn’t wash with the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Gennie Gebhart: “Facebook’s efforts to bring the internet and more choice to people are laudable, but it’s unclear if that’s truly its goal. Facebook has a responsibility to its investors and that is being served by getting more eyeballs on its site, to lure users.”","Whatever Facebook’s true goal, Free Basics offers the company another treasure trove of data: all user activities within the app are channeled through Facebook’s servers. This means Facebook can tell which third-party sites users are looking at, when and for how long.","“The program has created substantial new avenues for Facebook to gather data about the habits and interests of users in countries where they aspire to have a strong presence, as more users come online,” said Global Voices.","In spite of its shortcomings, Free Basics has grown rapidly and, according to Facebook, is used by 50m people. However, it’s mostly used by people who want to extend their mobile data package for free as opposed to connecting those who previously didn’t have access to the internet – an audience Facebook has repeatedly stated it is trying to reach.","“It is not a great approach for bringing people online, but it’s really good at saving costs for people already online,” said Dhanaraj Thakur, of the Alliance for Affordable Internet.","“The narrative Facebook is concerned with is about increasing access, but there’s a lack of empirical evidence. But that’s the whole point of the project!”","Facebook refused to answer questions about how many people it had brought online for the first time, how it places content within the apps or how the company measures the success of the scheme. However, the company pointed out the report only looked at a few markets and that it is an open platform for which any content provider can adapt their services.","“Working with partners and developers on Free Basics, we’re helping people around the world access impactful local services, including health resources, education and business tools, refugee assistance sites, and more,” said a spokeswoman.","Thakur believes a better solution would be to give low-income groups a limited amount of free data to access the open web.","Even so, the cost of data is one of many problems that need solving to get the unconnected online, said Gebhart.","“The barriers to internet access include signal availability, device ownership, education, digital literacy and electricity – these are arguably far more elemental and urgent,” she said."],"isopubdate":"2018-04-20"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,” he told London’s Observer.","SO WHAT ROLE DID FACEBOOK PLAY?","Facebook was not directly involved in Cambridge Analytica’s shadowy games of influence but its lax approach to user privacy made it possible.","A majority of reports this week referred to the firm’s dubious use of Facebook user data as a “data breach” but while it was against the company’s rules, that moniker is hardly accurate.","In 2014 researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan created an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. About 270,000 people agreed but due to Facebook’s terms of service the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the Dr Kogan the raw information of more than 50 million people, which he later handed to Cambridge Analytica.","It’s not exactly what Facebook wanted but a scenario it eagerly helped create and did little to prevent, despite the company’s assurances that “protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do.”","In a since deleted tweet, Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote: “It is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","It was not a breach or a hack but rather an inevitable outcome of what’s become known as surveillance capitalism — the term used to describe the data-hungry business model of big tech firms like Facebook, Google and Amazon.","“Facebook is using us.

It’s bought and sold every day.","When advertisers want to target a specific group of customers who, for example, are a particular age and have a certain political affiliation or interest, Facebook makes that possible. The stuff you share and the inferences Facebook makes about you are packaged together with similar people’s data, stripped of names and sold to companies. That allows businesses to put ads in front of people they’re certain they can influence.","Facebook’s not alone. Most advertiser-supported networks sell some of your information to third parties. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp do the same.","Giving up our privacy is the price we pay for getting to use Facebook for free. Most of the time, that tradeoff works: People take advantage of free services by posting, searching and sharing.

It allegedly leads back to a Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" a personality quiz that was billed as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","He legitimately gained access to information on 270,000 accounts through Facebook's Login feature, which lets people use their Facebook account to log into outside apps so they don't have to create new user names and passwords. At the time Kogan allegedly collected the information, Facebook allowed developers to also access information not only from the people who opted into the feature, but some other data about their network of friends. That added up to info from 50 million accounts, according to the New York Times. (Facebook changed its rules three years ago to stop developers from seeing information about people's friends.)","So far, Kogan's data-gathering was all above board and in compliance with Facebook's rules.","But in 2015, Facebook learned that Kogan had passed on that data to Cambridge Analytica, Paul Grewal, Facebook VP and deputy general counsel, said in a blog post. When Facebook found out, the social network demanded Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy the data. Facebook said it received certifications they had complied.","Now, there are allegations not all the data had been destroyed.","In reaction to the controversy, Facebook's most senior executives have been trying to stress that Facebook was deceived. Kogan shouldn't have passed on the data, they said, and those involved shouldn't have lied about deleting all of it.","\"[Kogan] lied to those users and he lied to Facebook about what he was using the data for,\" Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a now-deleted tweet.","But the dustup raises several questions about Facebook's responsibility in all of this. Facebook's trove of data on its 2 billion monthly users is a powerful tool. It helps millions of people connect with one another, while also helping advertisers send targeted ads based on what people put in their profiles.","To what extent is Facebook responsible for bad actors who abuse developer agreements? Could Facebook have done more to ensure the data had been destroyed -- beyond accepting certifications it was deleted? How can the social network try to make sure other developers don't pass on the data they collect to other parties?","Facebook didn't respond to a request for comment asking the company these questions.","Still, critics put the blame squarely on the social network. \"Facebook leaders think we are questioning their motives and sincerity. Hardly,\" tweeted Siva Vaidhyanathan, director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia. \"We are calling them out on their policies, actions, and their consequences.\"","Facebook leaders think we are questioning their motives and sincerity. Hardly. We are calling them out on their policies, actions, and their consequences.","For Facebook's part, Grewal said in his blog post that Facebook has made changes to how it deals with developers in the last five years. For example, the need to undergo an app review that requires them to justify collecting certain types of date.","A broader problem","What happened with Cambridge Analytica is just the latest in a growing list of ways Facebook's platform has been reportedly misused.","Malicious actors from propagandists to trolls have been abusing its systems for sometimes nefarious ends. The social network is still under fire for Russian trolls abusing Facebook with ads and organic posts to sow discord among Americans and influence the 2016 election.","Because of that, Facebook has drawn ire from lawmakers threatening to impose regulations on the social network and its advertising business. Last November, Facebook, along with Twitter and Google, sent their general counsels to hearings on Capitol Hill for a grilling from members of Congress.","The Cambridge Analytica incident has again spurred criticism from Congress. But this time they want answers straight from the top.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","But perhaps the most concerning part is that the Russians -- and now Cambridge Analytica -- didn't abuse Facebook by breaching its security. There were no passwords stolen, no systems hacked. Instead, they used Facebook's products exactly as they were built (though in the case of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, the rule-breaking allegedly came later).","Stamos and Andrew Bosworth, another top exec at Facebook who used to run its ads business, have been quick to point out the difference between data breach and service violation. Still, Bosworth acknowledged Facebook's responsibility to protect people from \"predatory behavior.\"","The distinction you're drawing between this infraction and a data breach is meaningful from your perspective, but not from ours,\" a Twitter user named Evan Baily replied to a Bosworth tweet. \"Facebook's platform must protect us from predatory behavior or we can't and shouldn't trust the platform.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies.

Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.

The New York Times reported that at least some of the data is still available on the internet.","Cambridge Analytica has denied inappropriate use of Facebook user profiles, but a former employee who is now a whistleblower has emphatically contradicted that claim.","Facebook now has 2.1bn active users, 1.4bn of whom use the site every day. As a social networking platform, it enables people to share ideas, photos and life events with friends, which collectively gives Facebook the highest-resolution image of every user of any media company, with an emphasis on emotions.","For advertisers, Facebook is exceptional for its ability to target more than half of all the people in every developed market and the power it gives to advertisers. On Facebook, advertisers can buy the equivalent of the Super Bowl audience – or any other audience – any day of the year.","Five years ago, researchers hypothesized that Facebook algorithms could be used to predict things like product and political preferences from just a handful of “likes”. Those researchers were concerned about the privacy implications, in part because the default Facebook setting for likes was “public”.","Cambridge Analytica thought it could transform US politics by exploiting that insight.","It was not just the user's profile data that was harvested, but also that of their friends, none of whom were notified","With the 2016 election cycle fast approaching, Cambridge Analytica did not have time to create its own custom profiles. So it went to researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who created a Facebook app that paid users to take a personality test.","There were problems with this arrangement. First, Kogan did not have permission from Facebook to use the data he gathered for commercial purposes, which best characterizes his Cambridge Analytica relationship. Second, the app not only harvested user profile data – which could be compared with the results of the personality test – but also the user profile data of each test taker’s friends, none of whom were notified.","Was any of this illegal? Facebook may be liable for a data breach, which may create legal problems under state law. The attorney general of Massachusetts has announced an investigation. Cambridge Analytica may face charges that it broke US election laws by employing people who were neither US citizens nor green card holders on a US presidential election campaign.

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K.

Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The home devices were apparently planned to debut at Facebook's developer conference in May, well ahead of their scheduled fall release date.","News of the decision to delay closely follows the breaking of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which it was found that that company gathered and stored the personal data of some 50 million Facebook users without their consent. It also comes on the heels of the revelation that the Android Facebook app has been quietly scooping up call and text metadata for years.","According to Bloomberg, focus groups were already leery about Facebook-branded smart home gadgets because of the company's propensity to horde personal data. Given that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will soon be testifying before Congress on his company's mishandling of that private user data, delaying the announcement of such devices seems like a sensible move.","The devices sound like they'll resemble Amazon's Echo Show and Spot, with a voice assistant and video chat features. According to Bloomberg's sources, they're still on track to release this fall.","We've learned new details about one of Facebook's forthcoming devices. According to The Information, the device is called Facebook Portal, and it is indeed similar to Amazon's Echo Show and Spot, with a camera for video chat. The Portal uses facial recognition; it was originally planned for the associated data to be stored on Facebook's servers, but after the company's recent troubles, it'll be stored locally. That might be cold comfort to users, since, as senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation Jennifer Lynch points out, \"they (Facebook) already have one of the largest facial recognition databases in the world.\"","Comments","Did anyone trust them before this? They've never seemed trustworthy at all, to me.","Ammar","United States != the rest of the world. The day people understand this simple phenomenon...","Facebook has over 2 billion active users. USA has a population of 325 million.","Even within the USA, hypocrisy is off the charts.

That includes all the smart devices and smart speakers in my home as well. On top of that, I run pi-hole in a highly aggressive mode. Granted, most common people wouldn't know the first thing about how to setup a system like this, but a bit of education would go a long way.

Privacy and facebook usage go against each other on a fundamental level. The average post people make are enough to get any info you may need on the person. IT can even be used to track someone to their front door.","Not necessarily. I have Facebook but pretty much never post on it - I use it to see what my friends are up to, find university events I'm interested in and message people using Messenger. I hardly share any personal information on the site.","When Facebook have already shown they don't care about our privacy, why would I be okay buying a device which gives Facebook the ability to record anything at any time in my house?

For the “avoidance of doubt,” the spokesman said, none of Kogan’s data was used in Cambridge Analytica’s 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign .","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Nix said Assange said no. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes. Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

In the aftermath of the Crimea crisis, he criticized Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia and denied that the Kremlin had deployed troops in Ukraine.CreditCreditMichal Cizek/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images","PRAGUE — For a brief moment, it seemed that the powerful adviser’s head might roll at the Castle. After he lost his long legal battle over a hefty state fine, the Czech president warned him to pay up or lose his post.","Then a guardian angel materialized from Moscow.","Lukoil, the largest private Russian oil company in an industry dependent on Kremlin approval, stepped in to pay the nearly $1.4 million fine owed to a Czech court.","The aide, Martin Nejedly, stayed on as economic adviser to the Czech president, Milos Zeman, and vice chairman of his party. Perhaps more important, he retained his office right next to the president’s in the Castle, the official palace that looms over the capital, Prague.","But the payment last spring raised questions about Russian influence-buying in the Castle, where Mr. Zeman has staked out a position as one of the Kremlin’s most ardent sympathizers among European leaders.","“Unfortunately in the Czech Republic, some advisers to the president or the prime minister are willing to cooperate with the Russians,” said Karel Randak, who retired as head of the Czech foreign intelligence service in 2007. “I am not saying that they are Russian agents — but unfortunately for some people, the money is more important than the security of the Czech Republic.”","On Thursday, the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia to retaliate against what American intelligence agencies say was the use of cyberattacks to meddle in the presidential election. But while the hacking focused attention on one particularly stealthy, intrusive way of influencing other states, it is just one lever that the Kremlin pulls.","Image","Martin Nejedly, center, the chief adviser to Mr. Zeman, with the head of Russian Railways at the time, Vladimir I. Yakunin, left, in Prague last year.CreditMichal Kamaryt/Czech News Agency, via Associated Press","The others include disinformation campaigns across a range of Russian-financed media outlets, support for violent fringe groups and even occasional plots against high-profile government critics.","And in some cases, experts say, the Kremlin and its allies resort to an old-fashioned but highly effective technique: trying to buy seats at the table of mainstream politics, never sure where or when their support might pay off.","One overarching question about Russian influence in Europe is whether President Vladimir V. Putin has just been lucky that some politicians echo his thinking, or whether the Kremlin has manipulated that trend. For many analysts, somewhere between pure luck and outright manipulation lies opportunism, and they call that a Kremlin specialty.","“The Russians systematically fill any open space, and they try to expand it,” said Martin Stropnicky, the Czech defense minister. “They have years of practice, and they are not in a hurry.”","Moscow did not construct public disenchantment with either the European Union or liberal immigration policies, for example, but it exploits such issues, analysts said. The Kremlin seeks to weaken what it considers alliances arrayed against it, like the European Union and NATO, especially as it sees them spreading through its natural sphere of influence in the former Soviet bloc.","“Every country that was successful in moving away from Communism toward an open, prosperous society based on law is a real threat to them,” said Ivan Gabal, deputy chairman of the Security Committee in the Czech Parliament.","Russia’s funding of political movements or individual politicians is nothing new, analysts say. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, all manner of payments from Moscow came to light, including subsidizing of the antinuclear movement.","Image","Mr. Zeman with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the Kremlin in 2015.CreditSergei Chirikov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images","“The behavior is so close to Soviet behavior it is ridiculous,” said Martin Kragh, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs in Stockholm. “It is like they picked up an old handbook and just dusted it off.”","Gleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant who served as a Kremlin spin doctor for 15 years before 2011, said the main difference now was that while the Soviet Union had sought out ideological allies, the modern Kremlin looked for anyone who could serve its purposes.","“I am certain that they pay a large number of different people,” he said. “In the Kremlin they see this as the normal ways of the market. I think that they always have some money, a line item in the budget, to help in creating advantageous positions.”","A Czech Leader’s Path Back","As prime minister from 1998 to 2002, Mr. Zeman was the key official in negotiating the Czech Republic’s entrance into the European Union, lauding it as his country’s return to its Western roots. Then he lost a presidential bid in 2003, withdrawing to a remote village and passing summer days floating in a rubber dinghy on a local lake.","Most Czechs forgot about him. The Russians did not.","He was invited to an annual forum used as a platform to attack Western institutions by Vladimir I. Yakunin, head of Russian Railways and a former Soviet intelligence officer at the United Nations. At least one Russian ambassador dropped in to visit as well, according to several Czech journalists.","Mr. Zeman made a comeback in 2013, winning the presidency in a victory partly engineered by Mr. Nejedly, the key financial official for the campaign.","Mr. Nejedly remains a shadowy figure — serving the president as a private adviser, not on the government payroll.","He spent most of the 1990s working in Russia, telling one Czech reporter in a rare interview that he promoted Opel cars. He eventually returned to the Czech Republic and in 2007 founded Lukoil Aviation Czech, a Lukoil subsidiary, becoming its general manager. The company won no-bid contracts to supply aviation fuel at several Czech airports, including Prague’s.","But the business failed, running up almost $7.5 million in debts, according to commercial records kept by the Prague Municipal Court, including a $1.4 million fine Mr. Nejedly owed to the Czech state over a fuel deal gone sour. The records were first unearthed in November by the MF DNES newspaper.","Fostering ties with energy middlemen who owe their fortunes to Russia and exert considerable political influence is a classic Russian method seen in Germany, Ukraine and other countries. Such links might not be forged by the Kremlin directly, but by individuals or companies seeking to please Mr. Putin.","Mr. Nejedly displays his Russian sympathies plainly enough — a recent picture published in the Czech media showed him holding his cellphone with a picture of Mr. Putin on the back.","Relations between Russia and the European Union deteriorated sharply in 2014 after Russian used its military to annex Crimea and to destabilize Ukraine. In the aftermath, Mr. Zeman proved notably friendly toward Russia.","He repeatedly criticized Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and denied that the Kremlin had deployed troops in Ukraine. The latter prompted Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister at the time, to remark in September of 2014: “I don’t know if the Czech Republic has an intelligence service. It does? Then he should ask them.”","Image","Protesters displayed red cards like those that indicate ejection from a soccer game during a protest against Mr. Zeman in 2014.CreditFilip Singer/European Pressphoto Agency","Mr. Zeman was among just two or three European Union leaders who attended the May 2015 Victory Day parade in Moscow commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Mr. Putin greeted him warmly.","“It is a pleasure to know that there are politicians in Europe who are capable of directly expressing their viewpoint and of asserting and conducting an independent policy,” the Russian president said, according to the Kremlin’s website.","Mr. Nejedly, though lacking a Czech government security clearance, was one of just two aides in the meeting, a move Mr. Zeman defended because of Mr. Nejedy’s role as an economic adviser.","Since that time, Mr. Zeman has continued backing pro-Kremlin policies. He endorsed the Russian intervention in Syria, and last summer called for a “Czechxit” referendum like the British vote to withdraw from the European Union.","Debate Over Influence","There is a debate in the Czech Republic over the extent to which the Kremlin influences the president. Some accuse him of accepting Russian money for his campaigns, while others say his statements reflect the sentiments of a public increasingly fed up with the European Union. Then there are those who argue that he has long espoused a role for the Czech Republic as an East-West bridge.","Some observers also note that as president, Mr. Zeman has a loud megaphone but little real power. The prime minister and the cabinet, who set policy, have remained staunchly pro-Western.","The president’s spokesman, Jiri Ovcacek, said in a text message that he would not respond to questions about alleged Russian influence. Mr. Zeman tends to dismiss his critics, including the press, as “Prague whiners” or “Prague cafe society.”","Image","Vagit Alekperov, the head of the Russian oil company Lukoil, told a Czech newspaper years ago that the company was privately owned and entirely independent of Russian politics.CreditSimon Dawson/Bloomberg","Mr. Nejedly, reached by telephone, railed briefly about the court fine levied against Lukoil Aviation Czech, before asking to see any questions in writing. He did not answer them. The Russian Embassy also asked for questions in writing and did not respond. Lukoil’s Moscow headquarters said it had liquidated the company and paid off its debts in accordance with Czech law, noting that it had appealed the fine and lost.","Mr. Zeman previously denied that Lukoil was among his sponsors, and Vagit Alekperov, head of the company, told a Czech newspaper years ago that Lukoil was privately owned and entirely independent of Russian politics, according to translations from The Fleet Sheet, an English-language news service.","It is difficult to prove that the Kremlin buys influence. Even in the rare cases when the payments are obvious, cause and effect are not black and white. Various Czech politicians and analysts argued that President Zeman merely reflected the popular mood at home.","Zdenek Ondracek, a member of Parliament for the Communist Party, said many Czechs were nostalgic for the days before 1989, when the Soviet model offered greater stability, income equality and relative ease.","“The socialist state offered its citizens many guarantees, and no one would find themselves facing hardships on their own,” Mr. Ondracek said, wearing a black T-shirt printed with words “I was born in the CSSR,” the old initials for the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.","In some cases, old ties may be more potent than any website pumping out false stories, said Mr. Randak, the former intelligence chief. He noted that many such personal links existed from the more than four decades that the Soviet Union controlled Czechoslovakia.","Russian businesspeople, journalists and others have longstanding social or commercial ties here, and some undoubtedly work for Russian intelligence, he said.","Image","Karel Randak, the former head of the Czech foreign intelligence service, in 2012.

Kelin, the coordinating council’s former head, and Igor Zolotarev. At first the exiles thought the embassy outreach was to learn how the Czech Republic transitioned away from Communism.","“This illusion disappeared at the time when Putin came to power and the whole interest of Russia in its citizens abroad was treating them as a channel to exercise Russian foreign policy abroad,” said Mr. Zolotarev, the founder of an expatriate group called Russian Tradition.","In addition, Prague is teeming with Russian spies. The 2015 annual report by the domestic intelligence service stated that the extraordinary number of Russian diplomats accredited to the embassy here meant many were working as intelligence officers. The number of Russian Embassy diplomats is generally pegged at 120 to 140, compared with about 40 Foreign Service officers for the United States.","Puppet organizations and other Russian operations “can be used to destabilize or manipulate Czech society or the political environment at any time, if Russia wishes to do so,” the report said.","In January, the Interior Ministry will start a Center Against Terrorism and Hybrid Threats meant to expose disinformation and the like.","Analysts suspect the Kremlin is the main Russian entity that tries to buy influence, but hardly the only one. Oligarchs and companies are guilty of the same behavior.","“A lot of this is not at the direct behest of Putin,” said Alina Polyakova of the Atlantic Council, editor of a recent study on Russian influence in Europe. “There are individuals who try to seek favoritism, who want to bring something good to the czar.”","Hana de Goeij contributed reporting.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: How Russians Pay to Play in Other Countries.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”","Cambridge Analytica said it does not hold or use any Facebook data and both companies deny any wrongdoing.","However the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said both firms must answer more questions over the claims that the data was gathered without consent after Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix’s appearance at a Commons hearing last month.","Its chairman Damian Collins said it was \"clear that [Mr Nix] has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements\" while he said the committee had \"repeatedly\" asked Facebook whether information had been taken without users' consent.","He claims that the firm \"deliberately avoided answering straight questions\" from the committee by sending witnesses who claimed not to know the answers, adding: \"This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.\"","President Donald Trump’s election campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","Britain’s Information Commissioner’s Office has announced it is conducting an investigation of Cambridge Analytica, which also had clients in this country.","“Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously,” said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham.","A Facebook spokesman said: “The claim that this is a data breach is completely false.

Now, 28-year-old Christopher Wylie goes on the record to discuss his role in hijacking the profiles of millions of Facebook users in order to target the US electorate","The first time I met Christopher Wylie, he didn’t yet have pink hair. That comes later. As does his mission to rewind time. To put the genie back in the bottle.","By the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time. On the phone, he was clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller. A politicker. A data science nerd.","Two months later, when he arrived in London from Canada, he was all those things in the flesh. And yet the flesh was impossibly young. He was 27 then (he’s 28 now), a fact that has always seemed glaringly at odds with what he has done. He may have played a pivotal role in the momentous political upheavals of 2016. At the very least, he played a consequential role. At 24, he came up with an idea that led to the foundation of a company called Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that went on to claim a major role in the Leave campaign for Britain’s EU membership referendum, and later became a key figure in digital operations during Donald Trump’s election campaign.","Or, as Wylie describes it, he was the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool”.","In 2014, Steve Bannon – then executive chairman of the “alt-right” news network Breitbart – was Wylie’s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica’s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the US electorate.","It was Wylie who came up with that idea and oversaw its realisation. And it was Wylie who, last spring, became my source. In May 2017, I wrote an article headlined “The great British Brexit robbery”, which set out a skein of threads that linked Brexit to Trump to Russia. Wylie was one of a handful of individuals who provided the evidence behind it. I found him, via another Cambridge Analytica ex-employee, lying low in Canada: guilty, brooding, indignant, confused. “I haven’t talked about this to anyone,” he said at the time. And then he couldn’t stop talking.","By that time, Steve Bannon had become Trump’s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, had won contracts with the US State Department and was pitching to the Pentagon, and Wylie was genuinely freaked out. “It’s insane,” he told me one night. “The company has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It’s like Nixon on steroids.”","He ended up showing me a tranche of documents that laid out the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. And in the months following publication of my article in May,it was revealed that the company had “reached out” to WikiLeaks to help distribute Hillary Clinton’s stolen emails in 2016. And then we watched as it became a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian collusion in the US election.","The Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation. We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was “information warfare”. But Wylie offers a unique, worm’s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US’s democratic process.","Wylie oversaw what may have been the first critical breach. Aged 24, while studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he came up with a plan to harvest the Facebook profiles of millions of people in the US, and to use their private and personal information to create sophisticated psychological and political profiles. And then target them with political ads designed to work on their particular psychological makeup.","He hesitates. “I’ll point out that I assumed it was entirely legal and above board.”","Last month, Facebook’s UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads:","Christian Matheson (MP for Chester): “Have you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?”","Simon Milner: “No.”","Matheson: “But they do hold a large chunk of Facebook’s user data, don’t they?”","Milner: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Two weeks later, on 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix: “Does any of the data come from Facebook?” Nix replied: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","And through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that – at least in 2014 – that certainly wasn’t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters – records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.","Going public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.","It’s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it’s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic – Robert Mueller’s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer’s first article in this investigation.","It has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind – to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold.","There are many points where this story could begin. One is in 2012, when Wylie was 21 and working for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, then in government as junior coalition partners. His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","Wylie grew up in British Columbia and as a teenager he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He left school at 16 without a single qualification. Yet at 17, he was working in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition; at 18, he went to learn all things data from Obama’s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to Canada for the Liberal party. At 19, he taught himself to code, and in 2010, age 20, he came to London to study law at the London School of Economics.","“Politics is like the mob, though,” he says. “You never really leave. I got a call from the Lib Dems. They wanted to upgrade their databases and voter targeting. So, I combined working for them with studying for my degree.”","Politics is also where he feels most comfortable. He hated school, but as an intern in the Canadian parliament he discovered a world where he could talk to adults and they would listen. He was the kid who did the internet stuff and within a year he was working for the leader of the opposition.","It showed these odd patterns. People who liked 'I hate Israel' on Facebook also tended to like KitKats","“He’s one of the brightest people you will ever meet,” a senior politician who’s known Wylie since he was 20 told me. “Sometimes that’s a blessing and sometimes a curse.”","Starting in 2007,Stillwell, while a student, had devised various apps for Facebook, one of which, a personality quiz called myPersonality, had gone viral. Users were scored on “big five” personality traits – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism – and in exchange, 40% of them consented to give him access to their Facebook profiles. Suddenly, there was a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook “likes” across millions of people.","Examples, above and below, of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test. Respondents were asked: How important should this message be to all Americans?","The research was original, groundbreaking and had obvious possibilities. “They had a lot of approaches from the security services,” a member of the centre told me. “There was one called You Are What You Like and it was demonstrated to the intelligence services. And it showed these odd patterns; that, for example, people who liked ‘I hate Israel’ on Facebook also tended to like Nike shoes and KitKats.","“There are agencies that fund research on behalf of the intelligence services. And they were all over this research. That one was nicknamed Operation KitKat.”","The defence and military establishment were the first to see the potential of the research. Boeing, a major US defence contractor, funded Kosinski’s PhD and Darpa, the US government’s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is cited in at least two academic papers supporting Kosinski’s work.","But when, in 2013, the first major paper was published, others saw this potential too, including Wylie. He had finished his degree and had started his PhD in fashion forecasting, and was thinking about the Lib Dems. It is fair to say that he didn’t have a clue what he was walking into.","“I wanted to know why the Lib Dems sucked at winning elections when they used to run the country up to the end of the 19th century,” Wylie explains. “And I began looking at consumer and demographic data to see what united Lib Dem voters, because apart from bits of Wales and the Shetlands it’s weird, disparate regions. And what I found is there were no strong correlations. There was no signal in the data.","“And then I came across a paper about how personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour, and it suddenly made sense. Liberalism is correlated with high openness and low conscientiousness, and when you think of Lib Dems they’re absent-minded professors and hippies. They’re the early adopters… they’re highly open to new ideas. And it just clicked all of a sudden.”","Here was a way for the party to identify potential new voters. The only problem was that the Lib Dems weren’t interested.","“I did this presentation at which I told them they would lose half their 57 seats, and they were like: ‘Why are you so pessimistic?’ They actually lost all but eight of their seats, FYI.”","Another Lib Dem connection introduced Wylie to a company called SCL Group, one of whose subsidiaries, SCL Elections, would go on to create Cambridge Analytica (an incorporated venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, funded by the latter). For all intents and purposes, SCL/Cambridge Analytica are one and the same.","Alexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn’t resist. “He said: ‘We’ll give you total freedom. Experiment. Come and test out all your crazy ideas.’”","Another example of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test.","In the history of bad ideas, this turned out to be one of the worst. The job was research director across the SCL group, a private contractor that has both defence and elections operations. Its defence arm was a contractor to the UK’s Ministry of Defence and the US’s Department of Defense, among others. Its expertise was in “psychological operations” – or psyops –changing people’s minds not through persuasion but through “informational dominance”, a set of techniques that includes rumour, disinformation and fake news.","SCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to realise were unequipped to defend themselves.","Wylie holds a British Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa – a UK work visa given to just 200 people a year. He was working inside government (with the Lib Dems) as a political strategist with advanced data science skills. But no one, least of all him, could have predicted what came next. When he turned up at SCL’s offices in Mayfair, he had no clue that he was walking into the middle of a nexus of defence and intelligence projects, private contractors and cutting-edge cyberweaponry.","“The thing I think about all the time is, what if I’d taken a job at Deloitte instead? They offered me one. I just think if I’d taken literally any other job, Cambridge Analytica wouldn’t exist. You have no idea how much I brood on this.”","A few months later, in autumn 2013, Wylie met Steve Bannon. At the time, he was editor-in-chief of Breitbart, which he had brought to Britain to support his friend Nigel Farage in his mission to take Britain out of the European Union.","What was he like?","“Smart,” says Wylie. “Interesting. Really interested in ideas. He’s the only straight man I’ve ever talked to about intersectional feminist theory. He saw its relevance straightaway to the oppressions that conservative, young white men feel.”","Wylie meeting Bannon was the moment petrol was poured on a flickering flame. Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time. He had a theory to prove. And at the time, this was a purely intellectual problem. Politics was like fashion, he told Bannon.","If you do not respect the agency of people, anything you do after that point is not conducive to democracy","Christopher Wylie","“[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’ to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.”","But Wylie wasn’t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: “information operations”, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military’s doctrine of the “five-dimensional battle space”. His brief ranged across the SCL Group – the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.","I tell him that another former employee described the firm as “MI6 for hire”, and I’d never quite understood it.","“It’s like dirty MI6 because you’re not constrained. There’s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It’s normal for a ‘market research company’ to amass data on domestic populations. And if you’re working in some country and there’s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that’s just a bonus.”","When I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it’s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. “And the cyberwarfare guy is like, ‘Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.’”","It was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer – the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates – and his daughter Rebekah.","Nix and Wylie flew to New York to meet the Mercers in Rebekah’s Manhattan apartment.","“She loved me. She was like, ‘Oh we need more of your type on our side!’”","Your type?","“The gays. She loved the gays. So did Steve [Bannon]. He saw us as early adopters. He figured, if you can get the gays on board, everyone else will follow. It’s why he was so into the whole Milo [Yiannopoulos] thing.”","Robert Mercer was a pioneer in AI and machine translation. He helped invent algorithmic trading – which replaced hedge fund managers with computer programs – and he listened to Wylie’s pitch. It was for a new kind of political message-targeting based on an influential and groundbreaking 2014 paper researched at Cambridge’s Psychometrics Centre, called: “Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans”.","“In politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it’s the opposite way around with Mercer,” says Wylie. “He said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.”","And to do that, Wylie needed data.","How Cambridge Analytica acquired the data has been the subject of internal reviews at Cambridge University, of many news articles and much speculation and rumour.","When Nix was interviewed by MPs last month, Damian Collins asked him:","“Does any of your data come from Global Science Research company?”","Nix: “GSR?”","Collins: “Yes.”","Nix: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Collins: “They have not supplied you with data or information?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “Your datasets are not based on information you have received from them?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “At all?”","Nix: “At all.”","The problem with Nix’s response to Collins is that Wylie has a copy of an executed contract, dated 4 June 2014, which confirms that SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with a company called Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, specifically premised on the harvesting and processing of Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.","He has receipts showing that Cambridge Analytica spent $7m to amass this data, about $1m of it with GSR. He has the bank records and wire transfers. Emails reveal Wylie first negotiated with Michal Kosinski, one of the co-authors of the original myPersonality research paper, to use the myPersonality database. But when negotiations broke down, another psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, offered a solution that many of his colleagues considered unethical. He offered to replicate Kosinski and Stillwell’s research and cut them out of the deal. For Wylie it seemed a perfect solution. “Kosinski was asking for $500,000 for the IP but Kogan said he could replicate it and just harvest his own set of data.” (Kosinski says the fee was to fund further research.)","An unethical solution? Dr Aleksandr Kogan Photograph: alex kogan","Kogan then set up GSR to do the work, and proposed to Wylie they use the data to set up an interdisciplinary institute working across the social sciences. “What happened to that idea,” I ask Wylie. “It never happened. I don’t know why. That’s one of the things that upsets me the most.”","It was Bannon’s interest in culture as war that ignited Wylie’s intellectual concept. But it was Robert Mercer’s millions that created a firestorm. Kogan was able to throw money at the hard problem of acquiring personal data: he advertised for people who were willing to be paid to take a personality quiz on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics. At the end of which Kogan’s app, called thisismydigitallife, gave him permission to access their Facebook profiles. And not just theirs, but their friends’ too. On average, each “seeder” – the people who had taken the personality test, around 320,000 in total – unwittingly gave access to at least 160 other people’s profiles, none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect.","What the email correspondence between Cambridge Analytica employees and Kogan shows is that Kogan had collected millions of profiles in a matter of weeks. But neither Wylie nor anyone else at Cambridge Analytica had checked that it was legal. It certainly wasn’t authorised. Kogan did have permission to pull Facebook data, but for academic purposes only. What’s more, under British data protection laws, it’s illegal for personal data to be sold to a third party without consent.","“Facebook could see it was happening,” says Wylie. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, ‘Fine’.”","Kogan maintains that everything he did was legal and he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Cambridge Analytica had its data. This was the foundation of everything it did next – how it extracted psychological insights from the “seeders” and then built an algorithm to profile millions more.","For more than a year, the reporting around what Cambridge Analytica did or didn’t do for Trump has revolved around the question of “psychographics”, but Wylie points out: “Everything was built on the back of that data. The models, the algorithm. Everything. Why wouldn’t you use it in your biggest campaign ever?”","In December 2015, the Guardian’s Harry Davies published the first report about Cambridge Analytica acquiring Facebook data and using it to support Ted Cruz in his campaign to be the US Republican candidate. But it wasn’t until many months later that Facebook took action. And then, all they did was write a letter. In August 2016, shortly before the US election, and two years after the breach took place, Facebook’s lawyers wrote to Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and told him the data had been illicitly obtained and that “GSR was not authorised to share or sell it”. They said it must be deleted immediately.","“I already had. But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,” says Wylie. “Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.”","There were multiple copies of it. It had been emailed in unencrypted files.","Cambridge Analytica rejected all allegations the Observer put to them.","Dr Kogan – who later changed his name to Dr Spectre, but has subsequently changed it back to Dr Kogan – is still a faculty member at Cambridge University, a senior research associate. But what his fellow academics didn’t know until Kogan revealed it in emails to the Observer (although Cambridge University says that Kogan told the head of the psychology department), is that he is also an associate professor at St Petersburg University. Further research revealed that he’s received grants from the Russian government to research “Stress, health and psychological wellbeing in social networks”. The opportunity came about on a trip to the city to visit friends and family, he said.","There are other dramatic documents in Wylie’s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: “We have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that “they understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections” but that they were “failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers”. The work, he said, would be “shared with the CEO of the business”, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.","“It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Wylie. “I didn’t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?”","Mueller’s investigation traces the first stages of the Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 US election back to 2014, when the Russian state made what appears to be its first concerted efforts to harness the power of America’s social media platforms, including Facebook. And it was in late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented the Russian oil company with an outline of its datasets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with “consumers”. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques. The first slide illustrates how a “rumour campaign” spread fear in the 2007 Nigerian election – in which the company worked – by spreading the idea that the “election would be rigged”. The final slide, branded with Lukoil’s logo and that of SCL Group and SCL Elections, headlines its “deliverables”: “psychographic messaging”.","Robert Mercer with his daughter Rebekah. Photograph: Sean Zanni/Getty Images","Lukoil is a private company, but its CEO, Alekperov, answers to Putin, and it’s been used as a vehicle of Russian influence in Europe and elsewhere – including in the Czech Republic, where in 2016 it was revealed that an adviser to the strongly pro-Russian Czech president was being paid by the company.","When I asked Bill Browder – an Anglo-American businessman who is leading a global campaign for a Magnitsky Act to enforce sanctions against Russian individuals – what he made of it, he said: “Everyone in Russia is subordinate to Putin. One should be highly suspicious of any Russian company pitching anything outside its normal business activities.”","Last month, Nix told MPs on the parliamentary committee investigating fake news: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do not have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","There’s no evidence that Cambridge Analytica ever did any work for Lukoil. What these documents show, though, is that in 2014 one of Russia’s biggest companies was fully briefed on: Facebook, microtargeting, data, election disruption.","Cambridge Analytica is “Chris’s Frankenstein”, says a friend of his. “He created it. It’s his data Frankenmonster. And now he’s trying to put it right.”","Only once has Wylie made the case of pointing out that he was 24 at the time. But he was. He thrilled to the intellectual possibilities of it. He didn’t think of the consequences. And I wonder how much he’s processed his own role or responsibility in it. Instead, he’s determined to go on the record and undo this thing he has created.","Because the past few months have been like watching a tornado gathering force. And when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something – his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead – it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold. Dealing with someone trained in information warfare has its own particular challenges, and his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off. And not everyone’s a fan. Any number of ex-colleagues – even the ones who love him – call him “Machiavellian”. Another described the screaming matches he and Nix would have.","“What do your parents make of your decision to come forward?” I ask him.","“They get it. My dad sent me a cartoon today, which had two characters hanging off a cliff, and the first one’s saying ‘Hang in there.’ And the other is like: ‘Fuck you.’”","Which are you?","“Probably both.”","What isn’t in doubt is what a long, fraught journey it has been to get to this stage. And how fearless he is.","After many months, I learn the terrible, dark backstory that throws some light on his determination, and which he discusses candidly. At six, while at school, Wylie was abused by a mentally unstable person. The school tried to cover it up, blaming his parents, and a long court battle followed. Wylie’s childhood and school career never recovered. His parents – his father is a doctor and his mother is a psychiatrist – were wonderful, he says. “But they knew the trajectory of people who are put in that situation, so I think it was particularly difficult for them, because they had a deeper understanding of what that does to a person long term.”","Facebook has denied and denied this. It has failed in its duties to respect the law","Paul-Olivier Dehaye","He says he grew up listening to psychologists discuss him in the third person, and, aged 14, he successfully sued the British Columbia Ministry of Education and forced it to change its inclusion policies around bullying. What I observe now is how much he loves the law, lawyers, precision, order. I come to think of his pink hair as a false-flag operation. What he cannot tolerate is bullying.","Is what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying?","“I think it’s worse than bullying,” Wylie says. “Because people don’t necessarily know it’s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it’s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you’re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.”","Russia, Facebook, Trump, Mercer, Bannon, Brexit. Every one of these threads runs through Cambridge Analytica. Even in the past few weeks, it seems as if the understanding of Facebook’s role has broadened and deepened. The Mueller indictments were part of that, but Paul-Olivier Dehaye – a data expert and academic based in Switzerland, who published some of the first research into Cambridge Analytica’s processes– says it’s become increasingly apparent that Facebook is “abusive by design”. If there is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be in the platform’s data flows, he says. And Wylie’s revelations only move it on again.","“Facebook has denied and denied and denied this,” Dehaye says when told of the Observer’s new evidence. “It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law. It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked","Read more","Facebook denies that the data transfer was a breach. In addition, a spokesperson said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules. Both Aleksandr Kogan as well as the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Millions of people’s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn’t have seen, and couldn’t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, “would work for anyone”. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?","It occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.","“Yes.”","Nato or non-Nato?","“Either. I mean they’re mercenaries. They’ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.”","It’s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing – at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public – our intimate family connections, our “likes”, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that’s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.","The Facebook data is out in the wild. And for all Wylie’s efforts, there’s no turning the clock back.","Tamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that she’d pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence.","She calls Wylie’s disclosures “wild” and points out that “the whole Facebook project” has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment.","“It’s a form of very deep but soft power that’s been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. It’s making this point, isn’t it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that they’ve turned on itself.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.","Cambridge Analytica boasts of dirty tricks to swing elections","Read more","The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analyticato determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.","The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.","The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.","On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.","“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.","The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.","Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.","Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.","Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.","Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”","The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.","“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks.

The firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.","A \"simplified\" settings menu.

We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed. So in addition to Mark Zuckerberg’s announcements last week – cracking down on abuse of the Facebook platform, strengthening our policies, and making it easier for people to revoke apps’ ability to use your data – we’re taking additional steps in the coming weeks to put people more in control of their privacy. Most of these updates have been in the works for some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.","Making Data Settings and Tools Easier to Find","Controls that are easier to find and use. We’ve redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top to bottom to make things easier to find. Instead of having settings spread across nearly 20 different screens, they’re now accessible from a single place.

The updates also coincide with sweeping new privacy laws, which require more specific and simplified disclosures to consumers, that are due to go into effect in Europe in May.","“The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, wrote in the blog post. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.”","Facebook said it did not implement the changes entirely because of Cambridge Analytica — and wasn’t motivated solely by Europe’s new data protection rules, either. But Rob Sherman, the company’s deputy chief privacy officer, acknowledged in an interview that the company must repair its relationship with users.","“People aren’t going to trust Facebook, they’re not going to be comfortable using it, if we’re not an ethical steward of data,” he said. “I think, certainly, what’s clear over the past week or so is that we’ve lost a lot of trust and we have to do some work to regain it, and that’s something I think all of us at Facebook have internalized and are working really hard to do.”","The changes Facebook announced Wednesday primarily redesign and streamline already-existing features. The social network already gives consumers the ability to download their data and control many privacy settings, albeit in a confusing way.","Nate Cardozo, senior staff attorney at the privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that Facebook’s design changes were a start, but did not address deep needs for consumers. For instance, he said, Facebook does not let people remove their data from the company’s servers. “Facebook has gone one tenth of the way toward restoring public trust here,” he said.","But research has shown that changes in design, sometimes called privacy nudges, can affect people's behavior, said Lorrie Cranor, director of the Cylab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s former chief technologist.","A 2010 study by Cranor and other Carnegie Mellon researchers found that people tend to comprehend simpler privacy policies better than long, complicated ones. The study, which included 764 participants and followed a format for privacy policies modeled after a nutrition label, also found that people got through simpler policies more quickly and were less frustrated by the experience.","Alessandro Acquisti, a Carnegie Mellon computer scientist who also co-authored the privacy study, said that Facebook’s controls had gotten more and more complex over the years in response to a series of privacy scandals. He applauded the streamlined changes, but said that overall they were akin to “putting lipstick on a pig” because Facebook’s underlying approach to user protecting user data was “ultimately broken, and today’s changes are not fixing that.”","Another big concern, he said, is whether Facebook’s default settings continue to encourage consumers to share large amounts of data. Researchers, he said, have long documented what is known as status quo bias, in which consumers are very unlikely to switch or opt out of the default mode that companies lay out for them.","The announcements come as Facebook weathers a barrage of unprecedented regulatory scrutiny. In the United States, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been asked to testify before three congressional committees investigating the Cambridge Analytica controversy, and he’s expected to submit to questioning by at least one of those panels. Similar probes are underway throughout Europe, including the United Kingdom, where lawmakers plan to grill Chris Cox, the chief product officer of Facebook, at a hearing next month.","European regulators have been especially critical of Facebook in recent weeks. Months from now, the European Union is set to begin enforcing a new set of tough privacy and data protection laws that require tech giants to be more forthcoming about the information they collect and why.","Appearing at a major industry conference in Washington, D.C. this week, some of those officials stressed that Facebook needs to learn from its mistakes.","“I think if Facebook would have spent 10 percent of this money on data protection issues, maybe the loss wouldn’t have been,” she said.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

GONZÁLEZ","In the days and weeks following the 2016 presidential elections, reports surfaced about how a small British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, might have played a pivotal role in Donald Trump’s surprise victory. The company claimed to have formulated algorithms to influence American voters using individually targeted political advertisements. It reportedly generated personality profiles of millions of individual citizens by collecting up to 5000 data points on each person. Then Cambridge Analytica used these “psychographic” tools to send voters carefully crafted online messages about candidates or hot-button political issues.","Although political consultants have long used “microtargeting” techniques for zeroing in on particular ethnic, religious, age, or income groups, Cambridge Analytica’s approach is unusual: The company relies upon individuals’ personal data that is harvested from social media apps like Facebook. In the US, such activities are entirely legal. Some described Cambridge Analytica’s tools as “mind-reading software” and a “weaponized AI [artificial intelligence] propaganda machine.” However, corporate media outlets such as CNN and the Wall Street Journal often portrayed the company in glowing terms.","Cambridge Analytica is once again in the headlines–but under somewhat different circumstances. Late last week, whistleblower Christopher Wylie went public, explaining how he played an instrumental role in collecting millions of Facebook profiles for Cambridge Analytica. This revelation is significant because until investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr published her exposé in The Guardian, Cambridge Analytica’s then-CEO Alexander Nix had adamantly denied using Facebook data. And although Facebook officials knew that Cambridge Analytica had previously gathered data on millions of users, they did not prohibit the company from advertising until last Friday, as the scandal erupted. To make matters worse, the UK’s Channel 4 released undercover footage early this week in which Cambridge Analytica executives boast about using dirty tricks–bribes, entrapment, and “beautiful girls” to mention a few.","The case of Cambridge Analytica brings into focus a brave new world of electoral politics in an algorithmic age–an era in which social media companies like Facebook and Twitter make money by selling ads, but also by selling users’ data outright to third parties. Relatively few countries have laws that prevent such practices–and it turns out that the US does not have a comprehensive federal statute protecting individuals’ data privacy. This story is significant not only because it demonstrates what can happen when an unorthodox company takes advantage of a lax regulatory environment, but also because it reveals how Internet companies like Facebook have played fast and loose with the personal data of literally billions of users.","From Public Relations to Psychological Warfare","In order to make sense of Cambridge Analytica it is helpful to understand its parent company, SCL Group, which was originally created as the PR firm Strategic Communications Laboratory. It was founded in the early 1990s by Nigel Oakes, a flamboyant UK businessman. By the late 1990s, the company was engaged almost exclusively in political projects. For example, SCL was hired to help burnish the image of Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid–but Oakes and SCL employees had to shut down their operations center when SCL’s cover was blown by the Wall Street Journal .","In July 2005, SCL underwent a dramatic transformation. It very publicly rebranded itself as a psychological warfare company by taking part in the UK’s largest military trade show. SCL’s exhibit included a mock operations center featuring dramatic crisis scenarios–a smallpox outbreak in London, a bloody insurgency in a fictitious South Asian country–which were then resolved with the help of the company’s psyops techniques. Oakes told a reporter: “We used to be in the business of mindbending for political purposes, but now we are in the business of saving lives.” The company’s efforts paid off. Over the next ten years, SCL won contracts with the US Defense Department’s Combatant Commands, NATO, and Sandia National Labs.","Over the past few years SCL–now known as SCL Group–has transformed itself yet again. It no longer defines itself as a psyops specialist, nor as a political consultancy–now, it calls itself a data analytics company specializing in “behavioral change” programs.","Along the way it created Cambridge Analytica, a subsidiary firm which differs from SCL Group in that it focuses primarily on political campaigns. Its largest investors include billionaire Robert Mercer, co-CEO of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who is best known for his advocacy of far-right political causes and his financial support of Breitbart News. Steve Bannon briefly sat on Cambridge Analytica’s board of directors.","Cambridge Analytica first received significant media attention in November 2015, shortly after the firm was hired by Republican presidential nominee Ted Cruz’s campaign. Although Cruz ultimately failed, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, claimed that Cruz’s popularity grew largely due to the company’s skillful use of aggregated voter data and personality profiling methods. In August 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica as part of a desperate effort to challenge Hillary Clinton’s formidable campaign machine. Just a few months later, reports revealed that Cambridge Analytica had also played a role in the UK’s successful pro-Brexit “Leave.EU” campaign.","Hacking the Citizenry","Cambridge Analytica relies upon “psychographic” techniques that measure the Big Five personality traits borrowed from social psychology: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.","In the US, Cambridge Analytica developed psychological profiles of millions of Americans by hiring a company called Global Science Research (GSR) to plant free personality quizzes. Users were lured by the prospect of obtaining free personality scores, while Cambridge Analytica collected data–and access to users’ Facebook profiles. Last week, The Guardian reported that Cambridge Analytica collected data from more than 300,000 Facebook users in this way. By agreeing to the terms and conditions of the app, those users also agreed to grant GSR (and by extension, Cambridge Analytica) access to the profiles of their Facebook “friends”–totalling approximately 50 million people.","Psychographics uses algorithms to scour voters’ Facebook “likes,” retweets and other social media data which are aggregated with commercially available information: land registries, automotive data, shopping preferences, club memberships, magazine subscriptions, and religious affiliation. When combined with public records, electoral rolls, and additional information purchased from data brokers such as Acxiom and Experian, Cambridge Analytica has raw material for shaping personality profiles. Digital footprints can be transformed into real people. This is the essence of psychographics: Using software algorithms to scour individual voters’ Facebook “likes,” retweets and other bits of data gleaned from social media and then combine them with commercially available personal information. Data mining is relatively easy in the US, since it has relatively weak privacy laws compared to South Korea, Singapore, and many EU countries.","In a 2016 presentation, Nix described how such information might be used to influence voter opinions on gun ownership and gun rights. Individual people can be addressed differently according to their personality profiles: “For a highly neurotic and conscientious audinece, the threat of a burglary–and the insurance policy of a gun. . .Conversely, for a closed and agreeable audience: people who care about tradition, and habits, and family.”","Despite the ominous sounding nature of psychographics, it is not at all clear that Cambridge Analytica played a decisive role in the 2016 US presidential election. Some charge that the company and its former CEO Alexander Nix, exaggerated Cambridge Analytica’s effect on the election’s outcome. In February 2017, investigative journalist Kendall Taggart wrote an exposé claiming that more than a dozen former employees of Cambridge Analytica, Trump campaign staffers, and executives at Republican consulting firms denied that psychographics was used at all by the Trump campaign. Taggart concluded: “Rather than a sinister breakthrough in political technology, the Cambridge Analytica story appears to be part of the traditional contest among consultants on a winning political campaign to get their share of the credit–and win future clients.” Not a single critic was willing to be identified in the report, apparently fearing retaliation from Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, who is also an investor in the firm.","Not-So-Innocents Abroad","By no means has Cambridge Analytica limited its work to the US. In fact, it has conducted “influence operations” in several countries around the world.","For example, Cambridge Analytica played a major role in last year’s presidential elections in Kenya, which pitted incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta of the right-wing Jubilee Party against Raila Odinga of the opposition Orange Democratic Movement. The Jubilee Party hired Cambridge Analytica in May 2017. Although the company claims to have limited its activities to data collection, earlier this week Mark Turnbull, a managing director for Cambridge Analytica, told undercover reporters a different story. He admitted that the firm secretly managed Kenyatta’s entire campaign: “We have rebranded the party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing–so just about every element of this candidate,” said Turnbull.","Given the most recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s planting of fake news stories, it seems likely that the company created persuasive personalized ads based on Kenyans’ social media data. Fake Whatsapp and Twitter posts exploded days before the Kenyan elections. It is worth remembering that SCL Group has employed disinformation campaigns for military clients for 25 years, and it seems that Cambridge Analytica has continued this pattern of deception.","The August elections were fraught with accusations of vote tampering, the inclusion of dead people as registered voters, and the murder of Chris Msando, the election commission’s technology manager, days before the election. When the dust settled, up to 67 people died in post-election violence–and Kenyatta ultimately emerged victorious. Weeks later, the Kenyan Supreme Court annulled the elections, but when new elections were scheduled for October, Odinga declared that he would boycott.","Given Kenya’s recent history of electoral fraud, it is unlikely that Cambridge had much impact on the results. Anthropologist Paul Goldsmith, who has lived in Kenya for 40 years, notes that elections still tend to follow the principle of “who counts the votes,” not “who influences the voters.”","But the significance of Cambridge Analytica’s efforts extends beyond their contribution to electoral outcomes. Kenya is no technological backwater. The world’s first mobile money service was launched there in 2007, allowing users to transfer cash and make payments by phone. Homegrown tech firms are creating a “Silicon Savannah” near Nairobi. Two-thirds of Kenya’s 48 million people have Internet access. Ten million use Whatsapp; six million use Facebook; two million use Twitter. As Kenyans spend more time in the virtual world, their personal data will become even more widely available since Kenya has no data protection laws.","Cambridge Analytica doesn’t need to deliver votes so much as to create the perception that they can produce results. . .Kenya provides an ideal entry point into [Africa]. . .Embedding themselves with ruling elites presents a pivot for exploiting emergent commercial opportunities. . .with an eye on the region’s resources and its growing numbers of persuadable youth.","Recent reports reveal that Cambridge Analytica has ongoing operations in Mexico and Brazil (which have general elections scheduled this July and October, respectively). India (which has general elections in about a year) has also been courted by the company, and it is easy to understand why: the country has 400 million smartphone users with more than 250 million on either Facebook or Whatsapp. India’s elections are also a potential gold mine. More than half a billion people vote in parliamentary elections, and the expenditures are astonishing: Political parties spent $5 billion in 2014, compared to $6.5 billion in last year’s US elections. India also has a massive mandatory ID program based on biometric and demographic data, the largest of its kind in the world.","Cambridge Analytica’s global strategy appears focused on expanding its market share in promising markets. Although many people might describe Kenya, Mexico, Brazil, and India as developing countries, each in fact has a rapidly growing high-tech infrastructure, relatively high levels of Internet penetration, and large numbers of social media users. They all have weak or nonexistent Internet privacy laws. Though nominally democratic, each country is politically volatile and has experienced episodic outbursts of extreme political, sectarian, or criminal violence. Finally, these countries have relatively young populations, reflecting perhaps a long-term strategy to normalize a form of political communication that will reap long-term benefits in politically sensitive regions.","The capacity for saturating global voters with charged political messages is growing across much of the world, since the cost of buying Facebook ads, Twitterbots and trolls, bots for Whatsapp and other apps is cheap–and since more people than ever are spending time on social media. Such systems can be managed efficiently by remote control. Unlike the CIA’s psyops efforts in the mid-20th century, which required extensive on-the-ground efforts–dropping leaflets from airplanes, bribing local journalists, broadcasting propaganda on megaphones mounted on cars–the new techniques can be deployed from a distance, with minimal cost. Cambridge Analytica relies upon small ground teams to do business with political parties, and partnerships with local business intelligence firms to scope out the competition or provide marketing advice, but most of the work is done from London and New York.","Weaponizing Big Data?","From its beginnings, Cambridge Analytica has declared itself to be a “data-driven” group of analytics experts practicing an improved form of political microtargeting, but there are indications that the firm has broader ambitions.","In March 2017, reports emerged that top executives from SCL Group met with Pentagon officials, including Hriar Cabayan, head of a branch which conducts DoD research and cultural analysis. A decade ago, Cabayan played an instrumental role in launching the precursor to the Human Terrain System, a US Army counterinsurgency effort which embedded anthropologists and other social scientists with US combat brigades in Iraq and Afghanistan.","A few months later, in August 2017, the Associated Press reported that retired US Army General Michael Flynn, who briefly served as National Security Director in the Trump administration, had signed a work agreement with Cambridge Analytica in late 2016, though it is unclear whether he actually did any work for the firm. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian operatives in late 2017, when he was working with Trump’s transition team. Given his spot in the media limelight, it is easy to forget that he once headed US intelligence operations in Afghanistan, advocating for a big data approach to counterinsurgency that would, among other things, include data collected by Human Terrain Teams.","The connections between Cambridge Analytica/SCL Group and the Pentagon’s champions of data-driven counterinsurgency and cyberwarfare may be entirely coincidental, but they do raise several questions: As Cambridge Analytica embarks on its global ventures, is it undertaking projects that are in fact more sinister than its benign-sounding mission of “behavioral change”? And are the company’s recent projects in Kenya, India, Mexico, and Brazil simply examples of global market expansion, or are these countries serving as laboratories to test new methods of propaganda dissemination and political polarization for eventual deployment here at home?","Here the lines between military and civilian applications become blurred, not only because ARPANET–the Internet’s immediate precursor–was developed by the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, but also because the technology can be used for surveillance on a scale that authoritarian regimes of the 20th century could only have dreamed about. As Yasha Levine convincingly argues in his book Surveillance Valley: The Secret Military History of the Internet, the Internet was originally conceived as a counterinsurgency surveillance program.","Neutralizing Facebook’s Surveillance Machine","It appears that many people are finally taking note of the digital elephant in the room: Facebook’s role in enabling Cambridge Analytica and other propagandists, publicists, and mind-benders to carry out their work–legally and discreetly. As recently noted by Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai in the online journal Motherboard, Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting practices weren’t security breaches, they were “par for the course. . .It was a feature, not a bug. Facebook still collects—and then sells—massive amounts of data on its users.” In other words, every Facebook post or tweet, every g-mail message sent or received, renders citizens vulnerable to forms of digital data collection that can be bought and sold to the highest bidder. The information can be used for all kinds of purposes in an unregulated market: monitoring users’ emotional states, manipulating their attitiudes, or disseminating tailor-made propaganda designed to polarize people.","“If your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used and misused. Hacked, breached, leaked, pilfered, conned, targeted, engaged, profiled, sold. There is no informed consent because it’s not possible to reasonably inform or consent.”","Cambridge Analytica is significant to the extent that it illuminates new technological controlling processes under construction. In a supercharged media environment in which Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) have become the primary means by which literally billions of people consume news, mass producing propaganda has never been easier. With so many people posting so much information about the intimate details of their lives on the Web, coordinated attempts at mass persuasion will almost certainly become more widespread in the future.","In the meantime, there are concrete measures that we can take to rein in Facebook, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and other technology giants. Some of the most lucid suggestions have been articulated by Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist and early Facebook investor. He recommends a multi-pronged approach: demanding that the social media companies’ CEOs testify before congressional and parliamentary committees in open sessions; imposing strict regulations on how Internet platforms are used and commercialized; requiring social media companies to report who is sponsoring political and issues-based advertisements; mandating transparency about algorithms (“users deserve to know why they see what they see in their news feeds and search results,” says McNamee); requiring social media apps to offer an “opt out” to users; banning digital “bots” that impersonate humans; and creating rules that allow consumers (not corporations) to own their own data.","In a world of diminishing privacy, our vulnerabilities are easily magnified. Experimental psychologists specializing in what they euphemistically call “behavior design” have largely ignored ethics and morality in order to help Silicon Valley companies create digital devices, apps, and other technologies that are literally irresistible to their users. As the fallout from Cambridge Analytica’s activities descends upon the American political landscape, we should take advantage of the opportunity to impose meaningful controls on Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other firms that have run roughshod over democratic norms–and notions of individual privacy–in the relentless pursuit of profit.","VIDEOS","Those who sent people to war were those who fought with them in the front lines.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2DDfRMJ?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=","title":"Facebook may have violated FTC privacy deal, say former federal officials, triggering risk of massive fines - The Washington Post","text":["Two former federal officials who crafted the landmark consent decree governing how Facebook handles user privacy say the company may have violated that decree when it shared information from tens of millions of users with a data analysis firm that later worked for President Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Such a violation, if eventually confirmed by the Federal Trade Commission, could lead to many millions of dollars in fines against Facebook, said David Vladeck, who as the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the subsequent consent decree resolving the case in 2011. He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The right-wing, voter-profiling company then used their information to target Americans with personalized anti-Clinton and pro-Trump propaganda.","Donald Trump's improbable rise to the presidency looks dirtier and dirtier. In the latest revelation, Facebook announced on March 18 that University of Cambridge psychology lecturer and St Petersburg university professor Dr Aleksandr Kogan \"lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government, and military work around the globe\".","In partnership with Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), they did that by creating the app, \"thisisyourdigitallife\". This purported to be a personality quiz that was billed as \"a research app used by psychologists\". It was used to spread individually targeted political propaganda.","This seemingly harmless quiz helped gathered, according to Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, \"nearly 5 thousand different data points about you to craft and target a message\".","It was never just the answers people gave to the quiz. The real crown jewel was the open access it gave Cambridge Analytica to their Facebook accounts. According to Wylie, hundreds of thousands of Facebook users took personality tests with the app. In doing so, users consented to their data being collected for academic use. Its use was to prove anything but academic.","At the same time, the app also gathered the test-takers' Facebook friends' personal information. This led for over 50 million users' data being passed on to Cambridge Analytica. This is against Facebook's \"platform policy\" which banned the collection of friends' data for advertising or any reasons besides improving user experience.","Yeah. That worked out well.","This data was then used, as Nix said, to create \"individualised targeted and engagement ads\". The data was analyzed in part with the Big 5 Personality Traits psychological model, aka OCEAN V. The result, according to Nix, might target a religious voter with 30 percent religious-tinted messages, 20 percent gun rights messages, and 30 percent with economic ads, while targeting his NRA member neighbor with mostly gun rights messages on Facebook.","How successful were they? There is no question that social networking played a major factor in the 2016 election. According to Cambridge Analytica lead data scientist David Wilkinson, the company advised Trump's campaign to allocate time and resources to rural voters, especially in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. This led to Cambridge Analytica saying afterwards, according to a resentful former senior Trump technology staffer, \"Look, I'm not saying they lied but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration.\"","Maybe it wasn't that much of an exaggeration.","Many, including the The New York Times, called the incident \"one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history\" and a \"breach\".","Privacy researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis sarcastically tweeted, \"Basically Facebook enabled mass phishing of accounts based on a promise developers wouldn't misuse that data. The system was working as designed, Facebook handed that data over willingly. Therefore their processes were just broken ... it wasn't a breach you see.\"","Facebook was aware that some of its users' data had been misused as early as 2015. Facebook demanded in August 2016 that both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica certify they had deleted the data. This was days before Trump hired Steve Bannon, former Cambridge Analytica vice president, to run his presidential campaign. Only now, as the news leaks, has Facebook admitted publicly that users' data has been harvested.","Cambridge Analytica has denied many of the allegations. The company now claims that when it learned the data \"had not been obtained\" in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted \"all data\" that it received. In addition, Cambridge Analytica now claims \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Sure. Whatever.","There are two morals to this story.","First, if you put any personal information on a public-facing network -- Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever -- you can expect it to be gathered and used. That should be old news to most of you, but people still seemed surprised when they learn how little \"privacy\" there actually is on the net.","Second, no matter how interesting or amusing a Facebook quiz looks, if it requires you to let it access your Facebook account, don't take it. The only purpose of these quizes is to gather your information.","Finally, check to see what apps already have access to your data. Many sites use Facebook Connect logins as their logins. That's fine, but keep in mind if you turn off your Facebook account, you also lose access to these sites. But, there are other apps that you may not be using and are just vacuuming down your data. Delete these.

The stock prices for companies in each sub sector all generally outpaced the bull market that started in 2009. Why might that be do you think?","And now Zuck is calling for the regulation of social media. Big surprise.","(From Reason)","Only the paranoid survive in Silicon Valley, right? Zuckerberg may be young (he’s just 33) but he’s old enough to remember MySpace and Friendster. And he’s certainly aware that Facebook’s “pivot to video,” brief emphasis on live events, and push for “insta-articles” didn’t work out well for his company, publishers, or individual users. He hangs around with people who don’t just remember AOL and Netscape but also invested in them. The history of business is a cemetery of whales, of “too big to fail” juggernauts who are barely remembered these days. The supermarket chain A&Ponce had bigger market share in its sector than Walmart does today. It revolutionized the buying and selling of groceries and has passed away, little-remembered and little-missed. Only 60 companies that appeared in the 1955 version of the Fortune 500 were still there in last year’s list, economist Mark Perry reminds us. More important for the current conversation (emphasis in original):","At the current churn rate, about half of today’s S&P 500 firms will be replaced over the next 10 years as “we enter a period of heightened volatility for leading companies across a range of industries, with the next ten years shaping up to be the most potentially turbulent in modern history” according to Innosight…","…So goes Facebook. By not simply relenting to regulation but actively embracing it and, more important, shaping it to his company’s maximum benefit, Zuckerberg might just make sure that Facebook sticks around far longer than it would otherwise. In the parlance of historian Burton W. Folsom, the “market entrepreneur,” who makes a fortune by providing a new or improved service at a great price, almost inevitably evolves into the “political entrepreneur,” who uses regulation and other connections to stay on top. This predictable but dispiriting two-step may well be the greatest challenge to libertarian economics. It certainly is one of the toughest problems to fix.","Nick Gillespe is absolutely correct on this last point particularly. Crony capitalism might indeed be the greatest challenge to libertarian economics. How does one allow the market to work and keep businesses and other special interests from gaming the system for their benefit?","The answer (to a very large degree) is to limit the catalyst of cronyism, government. But that is a bitter pill for many who still think more government is the answer. It will take a massive shift in the understanding of civil society for many people to see that generally, more government is actually hurting them. Until then the Facebooks of the world will keep writing the laws. It’s the progressive way, going right back to the days of Woodrow Wilson. Corporate/Government partnerships to gather power and wealth for the connected."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows.

Now. - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg need to come clean about 2016. Now.","Over the weekend, the New York Times and the Observer of London posted a blockbuster investigative piece revealing that Cambridge Analytica, the firm brought on by the Trump campaign to target voters online, used the data of tens of millions of people obtained from Facebook without proper disclosures or permission.","In the wake of this report, it’s more than past time for Mark Zuckerberg to testify to Congress about Facebook’s role in the 2016 elections and why he believes existing privacy laws are adequate to protect Americans from misuse and abuse of technology platforms.","And I mean Mark Zuckerberg. Not a Facebook lawyer, like the one the company sent to Congress last year for hearings on how fake news swamped tech platforms such as, oh, Facebook. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tweeted:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The investigation published by the Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica, after receiving $15 million from conservative donor Robert Mercer in 2014 to micro-target voters, obtained the information to do so in a questionable way. A British professor collected the information from Facebook, saying he was conducting an academic personality study. He did get the approval of about 270,000 people who signed up to take part in the study — they were told their information would be used. He did not, however, get the permission of the users’ friends, whose information was also gathered — an estimated 50 million people.","It’s not just that such an action is unethical. It might well be a violation of an agreement Facebook made with the federal government. Two former employees of the Federal Trade Commission have now told The Post that it’s quite possible that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement with the agency to notify and offer users an out when there is an effort to use their personal information in a way not in line with their privacy settings. This agreement was reached after consumer groups complained that Facebook was cavalier with personal information.","So back to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out, courtesy of a 2015 piece in the Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica and British academics had information on many users that agreed to such a collection, it demanded the information be destroyed. This did not happen. Facebook cited this when pressed on the latest revelations by the Times, claiming that the companies that misused the data “certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","(On Monday afternoon, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica agreed to a digital audit to prove it destroyed the disputed materials. The professors involved in using the data also agreed to an audit.)","And so, after the Times published its piece, Facebook didn’t own up to what happened. Instead, Facebook executives have gotten into a multiplespats with reporters and others over whether the Cambridge Analytica incident is a “breach” or a mere misuse of personal information, since some (but not all!) the people whose data was involved did give permission for their data to be taken and the company was not actually hacked. Facebook’s motive for this is almost certainly legal and regulatory. As Bloomberg News notes, a “breach” is a specific term that requires the company to notify users their information was illegally accessed.","But there is quite possibly a bigger motive. Painting Cambridge Analytica as the villain is an attempt to get Facebook off the hook for its ongoing role in everything from other invasions of privacy (more about that in a moment) to the ongoing complaints about its role in spreading fake news in the 2016 elections. If one or two rogue companies such as Cambridge Aanlytica — and not Facebook — are responsible for this mass misuse of data, perhaps the company can say more regulation is not needed.","But don’t fall for the idea that Facebook is not the problem. This is hardly a first-time offense for Facebook, which — a reminder — allowed fake news to flood many users’ news feeds in the months leading up to the 2016 elections.","In fact, Washington perhaps should have gotten interested in Facebook well before the Trump election contretemps. Over time, Facebook has indulged in numerous instances of dodgy behavior. There was the time Facebook altered news feeds to study whether they could affect the mood of people on the platform. There was the reveal that its platform permitted ad buyers to target people with such delightful terms as “jew hater.” And the discovery that Facebook made it possible to target housing ads to whites only.","Whether this latest scandal was a breach or a misuse of information is irrelevant. It was wrong. Zuckerberg needs to explain — slowly and clearly and without legal terminology or whiny excuses — what went wrong at the company he founded in his Harvard dorm room, and what steps the company is taking to make sure it never happens again. My suspicion? He can’t do that. Instead, a Zuckerberg appearance will demonstrate the need for significant federal regulation of large technology platforms. No wonder it hasn’t happened yet.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Helaine OlenHelaine Olen is a contributor to the PostPartisan blog and the author of \"Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry.\" Her work has appeared in Slate, the Nation, the New York Times, the Atlantic and many other publications.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

{"originalurl":"http://a.msn.com/01/en-my/BBKnzCW?ocid=st","title":"U.S. and British lawmakers demand answers from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg","text":["The demands came in response to news reports Saturday about how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, used a feature once available to Facebook app developers to collect information on 270,000 people and, in the process, gain access to data on tens of millions of their Facebook “friends” — few, if any, of whom had given explicit permission for this sharing.","Though both companies have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either nation.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","On Sunday morning, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment to the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. It has said previously that the company has made changes to privacy policies to prevent similar data loss without explicit consent from users.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential race — have intensified. He has authored blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as General Counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","The company also has worked hard in recent days to cast the data collection by people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica as not a “breach” because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Now He Wants to Destroy Europe’s. - The New York Times","text":["Steve Bannon Is Done Wrecking the American Establishment. Now He Wants to Destroy Europe’s.","MILAN — Stephen K. Bannon leaned back in an armchair opposite a copy of a painting by an Italian old master and explained his modest efforts to build a vast network of European populists to demolish the Continent’s political establishment.","“All I’m trying to be,” he said, “is the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement.”","Just that.","Only months ago, Mr. Bannon was forced out of the White House and Breitbart News, the alt-right news empire he helped make into a political force, for the sharp criticisms of President Trump’s children attributed to him in a book. “He’s lost his mind,” Mr. Trump said at the time.","But now Mr. Bannon, the architect of Mr. Trump’s populist campaign message and the president’s former chief strategist, has returned with an international mission.","On Saturday, he is set to headline the annual conference of France’s far-right National Front in the northern city of Lille, where he will be introduced by its leader, Marine Le Pen. People with knowledge of Mr. Bannon’s itinerary suggested that he might meet later in the weekend with the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, but Mr. Bannon declined to say whether or not he would, only saying that he admired Mr. Orban as a “hero” and “the most significant guy on the scene right now.”","In Zurich, Mr. Bannon says, he had a “fascinating” meeting on Tuesday with leaders of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party.","They included Alice Weidel and Beatrix von Storch, who recently reacted to a New Year’s Eve public service announcement by the German police that went out in various languages, including Arabic, by tweeting, “Are they seeking to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men?”","But it is Italy, where populist forces smashed the country’s establishment by combining to win more than half the vote on Sunday, that Mr. Bannon has turned into his de facto headquarters.","In a sprawling interview here, he declined to name whom he had met, other than to describe them as a broad array of politicians, operatives and investors.","(A spokesman for Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League, said the two would have liked to have met, but did not. A spokesman for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which won a third of Italian votes, did not return a request for comment.)","Aside from the occasional coffee at Campo de’ Fiori or photo-op at Piazza Navona, Mr. Bannon has been holed up in hotel rooms, taking meeting after meeting.","In Rome, he stayed at the luxurious Raphael hotel, where Bettino Craxi, the face of Italy’s corrupt establishment and mentor to Silvio Berlusconi, was pelted with coins in 1993 by an angry mob as he departed the political scene.","In Milan, he sat in a room at the grand Principe di Savoia, opposite a copy of Titian’s portrait of the Duke of Mantua, a master of intrigue in Renaissance Italy and a longtime sufferer of syphilis, surrounded by red damask wallpaper. Jams were on a room service cart, and a copy of a book titled “Headlines All My Life” was on the desk.","In both cities, he wore a blue and white striped button down over a polo shirt. In Rome the polo was orange. In Milan it was blue.","He sipped sparkling water and described a grand vision for a global populist future.","In the United States, Mr. Bannon said, he is working on a project to create a think tank to “weaponize” populist economic and social ideas.","He sees that work spreading to Europe, where a proliferation of populist websites in the image of Breitbart News, either owned by him or others, will spread those ideas, under his guidance.","As a final component, he wants to train an army of populist foot soldiers in the language and tools of social media.","Mr. Bannon said that a common message he had received from populists throughout Europe was a desire to establish a media outlet for their views.","“They see what Breitbart did and they want it in their own language,” said Mr. Bannon, who slipped into the present tense when talking about the website from which he recently separated. “That’s the key. Right now my sites are in English, they want one in their own language,” he said, calling that “phase two.”","He could be forgiven the slip, as the site still seems to be in his thrall. (“Stephen K. Bannon took Zurich by storm Tuesday, addressing a sell-out crowd,” began Breitbart’s article on the speech.)","But Mr. Bannon, who said he was paying for the trip, said he was weighing whether to buy a name-brand outlet, like Newsweek or United Press International, or to start a new one, or to connect entrepreneurs with capital or invest himself.","He imagined a scoop-driven and high-metabolism outlet “like Axios,” he said, referring to the buzzy Washington newsletter, but with a populist bent that would devour Europe’s sleepy legacy papers.","“Whether I do it or a local entrepreneur does it,” he said, “there are going to be these populist nationalist news sites that pop up in the next year on line. That will only take these things to the next level.”","With Europe more aggressively tackling the migration issue, Mr. Bannon was aiming to move the future battle of populism to other terrains.","He said that the reason it was so important to get populist nationalist governments in place was to prepare for a coming great-powers clash with an axis of ancient Turkish, Persian and Chinese civilizations. “Elites can’t fight that fight,” he said. “Because people have to buy into it.”","He is also increasingly interested in motivating people to fight media conglomerates like Facebook that monetize their data. And he has become fascinated with crypto currencies and how they can help populist movements, the subject of a speech he gave in Zurich this week.","In preparation for the speech, organized by Die Weltwoche, a conservative Swiss magazine, Mr. Bannon said he visited the town of Zug, known as Crypto Valley for its bustling cryptocurrency industry. He was impressed.","“If Brussels and the European Central Bank is worried about Italy going to the lira, their concerns should be that all these communities and states are going to crypto,” he said in Milan.","In the meantime, he said, he admires Italy’s populist parties for already being on the technological cutting edge.","The Five Star Movement, a web-based party that preaches direct, online democracy, and the League, the hard-right, formerly northern-based secessionist party, both dominated social media during the campaign.","Often, their critics say, they did it with spurious and inflammatory fake news about migrants and crime. Many of those messages seemed propelled by automated bots rather than real supporters.","“You can’t just have just all humans, I’m sure they have some bots,” Mr. Bannon said, unbothered. “The thing is that they are generating enthusiasm on shoestrings.”","He said he hoped the two parties would eventually join forces — something not out of the question as the Italians try to form a government after an inconclusive election.","But he spoke also almost sympathetically about Matteo Renzi, the now vanquished Italian leader who only years ago seemed to be the future of Italy and the European center-left.","Mr. Renzi, he said, was “an object lesson to every rising politician in Europe,” and not a good one.","The former prime minister, he said, had tried to play by Brussels’s rules when it came to the migration crisis, and instead the European Union allowed other countries to close their borders, leaving Italy to take the brunt of the burden.","“They hung him out to dry,” he said.","Mr. Bannon said Italian voters on Sunday also spurned Pope Francis, who has urged tolerance for migrants.","“This vote was a rejection of the pope,” said Mr. Bannon, a Catholic who has nonetheless been a longtime critic of the pope’s politics. “The pope likes to see himself as a radical and an anti-establishment revolutionary for the little guy; the little guy put the pope in his place on Sunday.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-06-08"}

I'll post those sentences on their own first, then follow up with the questions\nthey raise in my mind. You can also watch the video below, the privacy part we transcribe is from 3:00 to 4:00.","Zuckerberg:","\"When I got started in my dorm room at Harvard, the question a lot of people asked was 'why would I want to put any information on the Internet at all? Why would I want to have a website?'","\"And then in the last 5 or 6 years, blogging has taken off in a huge way and all these different services that have people sharing all this information. People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information\nand different kinds, but more openly and with more people. That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.","\"We view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and be updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are.","\"A lot of companies would be trapped by the conventions and their legacies of what they've built, doing a privacy change - doing a privacy change for 350 million users is not the kind of thing that a lot of companies\nwould do. But we viewed that as a really important thing, to always keep a beginner's mind and what would we do if we were starting the company now and we decided that these would be the social norms now and we\njust went for it.\"","That's Not a Believable Explanation","This is a radical change from the way that Zuckerberg pounded on the importance of user privacy for years. That your information would only be visible to the people you accept as friends was fundamental to the DNA of the social\nnetwork that hundreds of millions of people have joined over these past few years. Privacy control, he told me less than 2 years ago,\nis \"the vector around which Facebook operates.\"","I don't buy Zuckerberg's argument that Facebook is now only reflecting the changes that society is undergoing. I think Facebook itself is a major agent of social change and by acting otherwise Zuckerberg is being arrogant and condescending.","Perhaps the new privacy controls will prove sufficient. Perhaps Facebook's pushing our culture away from privacy will end up being a good thing. The way the company is going about it makes me very uncomfortable, though,\nand some of the changes are clearly bad. It is clearly bad to no longer allow people to keep the pages they subscribe to private on Facebook.","This major reversal, backed-up by superficial explanations, makes me wonder if Facebook's changing philosophies about privacy are just convenient stories to tell while the company shifts its strategy to exert control over\nthe future of the web.","Facebook's Different Stories","First the company kept user data siloed inside its site alone, saying that a high degree of user privacy would make users comfortable enough to share more information with a smaller number of trusted people.","Now that it has 350 million people signed up and connected to their friends and family in a way they never have been before - now Facebook decides that the initial, privacy-centric, contract with users is out of date. That\nusers actually want to share openly, with the world at large, and incidentally (as Facebook's Director of Public Policy Barry Schnitt told me in December) that it's time for increased pageviews and advertising\nrevenue, too.","The Flimsy Evidence","What makes Facebook think the world is becoming more public and less private? Zuckerberg cites the rise of blogging \"and all these different services that have people sharing all this information.\" That last part\nmust mean Twitter, right? But blogging is tiny compared to Facebook! It's made a big impact on the world, but only because it perhaps doubled or tripled the small percentage of people online who publish long-form text\ncontent. Not very many people write blogs, almost everyone is on Facebook.","Facebook's Barry Schnitt told us last month that he too believes the world is becoming more open and his evidence is Twitter,\nMySpace, comments posted to newspaper websites and the rise of Reality TV.","But Facebook is bigger and is growing much faster than all of those other things. Do they really expect us to believe that the popularity of reality TV is evidence that users want their Facebook friends lists and fan pages\nmade permanently public? Why cite those kinds phenomena as evidence that the red hot social network needs to change its ways?","The company's justifications of the claim that they are reflecting broader social trends just aren't credible. A much more believable explanation is that Facebook wants user information to be made public and so they\n\"just went for it,\" to use Zuckerberg's words from yesterday.","(Why didn't Arrington press Zuckerberg on stage about this? The rise of blogging is evidence that Facebook needs to change its fundamental stance on privacy?)","This is Very Important","Facebook allows everyday people to share the minutia of their daily lives with trusted friends and family, to easily distribute photos and videos - if you use it regularly you know how it has made a very real impact on families\nand social groups that used to communicate very infrequently. Accessible social networking technology changes communication between people in a way similar to if not as intensely as the introduction of the telephone and\nthe printing press. It changes the fabric of peoples' lives together. 350 million people signed up for Facebook under the belief their information could be shared just between trusted friends. Now the company says\nthat's old news, that people are changing. I don't believe it.","I think Facebook is just saying that because that's what it wants to be true.","Whether less privacy is good or bad is another matter, the change of the contract with users based on feigned concern for users' desires is offensive and makes any further moves by Facebook suspect."],"isopubdate":"2010-01-10"}

Until now.","Over this past weekend, Zuckerberg took out full page ads in multiple newspapers in both the US and the UK in order to apologize for Facebook’s negligence and the security issues which have resulted from it.","Zuckerberg wrote, “This was a breach of trust and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. I promise to do better for you.”","This apology is the very definition of “too little, too late.” This data breach started in 2014, and it took Zuckerberg until now to take any sort of public responsibility for his company’s clear disregard of their users’ privacy. If he really, truly cared, he would’ve shut this down immediately, but he didn’t. Not even close.","Zuckerberg claims that Facebook is now “taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” but it’s tough to avoid thinking that they’re only doing so because they got caught. Now we can’t help but wonder what other personal information has been revealed to outside developers via Facebook over the years, because it’s not unreasonable to think that Cambridge Analytica was the only firm to take advantage of Facebook’s negligence.","This entire situation is unacceptable, and no eight-sentence advertisement can fix what Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook have done. Not only does it not actually do anything constructive, but one can’t help but feel like it’s only coming as a result of Zuckerberg being caught. Had the news of the data breach not been made public, it’s highly doubtful that Facebook would have done anything to stop it from happening again.","Like someone only confessing to robbing a convenience store after camera footage showed their face attached to the arm holding the gun, Zuckerberg tried to skate around the truth until there was irrefutable proof of his involvement.

He was hired to create a website for $1,500 (as he explained in that “60 Minutes” interview) and then his role expanded until he was managing tens of millions of dollars intended to promote the presidential candidate online.","The point of the interview was, in part, to serve as a profile of Parscale but, more broadly, to explain the primary way in which those millions were spent. Per Parscale’s accounting, that was largely on Facebook advertising. Trump’s team advertised on other platforms, too, but “Facebook was the 500-pound gorilla, 80 percent of the budget kind of thing,” Parscale said.","He also revealed that Facebook even sent staff — whose political persuasion had been cleared by the company — to aid in that effort, to help Parscale “know every, single secret button, click, technology [they] have,” as he said in the interview. The campaign poured money into Facebook, sending thousands of versions of tweaked ads to maximize response. Then it won the presidency by a margin narrow enough that Parscale (and Facebook) can justifiably take credit.","Parscale — and every political consultant in a similar situation — is doing this interview to build his business. The introduction of sophisticated digital tools to the process of electing candidates has resulted in a bumper crop of people claiming that they have mastered this inscrutable system and that you should hire them.","Right after the campaign, it was the firm Cambridge Analytica that was making this case, arguing that its black-box analysis of the psychology of American voters allowed Trump to target specific sorts of people with ads that dug deep into their brains to trigger a response. The company (owned in part by the family of Robert Mercer, which was in other ways essential to Trump’s success) wanted to convince future candidates that they could work their magic to get them elected, too.","To “60 Minutes,” Parscale dismissed that claim — in part because he was in the midst of claiming that he was the one with the magic touch. He didn’t think Cambridge Analytica’s system of creating “psychographic” profiles of people was sinister, he said — he just didn’t think it worked.","Which is a simply bizarre claim in the broader context. It isn’t that Parscale doesn’t think that building profiles of people to target ads to them doesn’t work. It’s that Parscale doesn’t seem to realize that this is basically what Facebook was doing for him, in real-time.","By its very nature, Facebook does a more complete and more robust version of what Cambridge Analytica claims to accomplish. In 2014, we explained how Facebook’s political tools work, how it combines data about what you’ve clicked with outside consumer data to get as complete a picture of who you are and what you like as anything that exists. But then it overlays the ability to advertise specific things to specific people — and to test and refine and improve on those ads.","This is what Parscale was describing to “60 Minutes” — not his genius, but Facebook’s. He shows the nifty tricks that you can do with Facebook, A/B testing (as the process is known) different versions of ads with different photos and ads that allow the most effective to quickly rise to the surface. He clearly used all of those secret buttons, clicks and technology that he sought, leveraging Facebook’s deep sense of its individual users and tools to target them. Stepping back, Parscale comes off like the guy who hires LeBron James to play on his team in a 3-on-3 basketball tournament and then brags about his capable coaching. He’s an ad buyer, who lets the platform — say, on Google, when you search for his name — do the work.","From Facebook’s perspective, dedicating staff to a client who was spending north of $70 million with your company (80 percent of the $94 million Parscale says the campaign paid his company to buy ads) makes perfect sense. But it does complicate Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s statement last month about how Facebook is being deliberate about protecting the “integrity of elections,” as it did in Germany’s recent balloting. Facebook doesn’t want outside actors (read: Russians) buying secret ads to influence the election but will provide you staff resources to help you spend millions to influence it yourself.","Again, we can’t know how much influence Facebook had. We know that the social-networking site has, in the past, proven that it can increase turnout for a campaign, but we don’t know how much it boosted turnout for Trump in 2016, or where.","Nor do we know how much Facebook advertising reduced turnout. Shortly before the election, Bloomberg reported on the Trump campaign’s tripartite voter suppression effort, targeting black voters, young women and white liberals with ads to discourage them from being enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.","In the least believable part of Parscale’s interview, he denies that this happened.","“Did you microtarget by race?” CBS’s Lesley Stahl asks.","“No, we did not,” Parscale replies. “Not at all.”","If he never targeted anyone by race at all, his would be the first campaign in probably a century not to. Of course they targeted to some extent by race; every campaign does. Setting aside the context of voter suppression, there are issues that resonate better with, say, Hispanic voters than white ones, and so you talk about those issues with Hispanic voters. To go back to the basketball tournament analogy, what Parscale is saying is the equivalent of his having asked LeBron James not to take any jump shots. Sure you did.","Part of the problem with Facebook’s entry into politics, as the whole Russian-intervention situation has shown, is that some ads are bought quietly and shown only to small groups of people. Parscale claims that the campaign ran those so-called “dark ads” (so-called because they exist mostly in the shadows) but that none had negative or controversial messages. Had they done so, he said, “they would share a million times, it would be all over.”","Assuming, that is, that people knew they were from the Trump campaign.","The takeaway from the “60 Minutes” interview is simple. Facebook is a juggernaut that’s probably more influential in politics than it realizes itself. (See this New York magazine article to that end.)","Parscale says that his wife likes to say that “[he] was thrown into the Super Bowl, never played a game and won.” Right. It’s just that, in that example, he’s neither Tom Brady nor Bill Belichick. At best, he’s the guy who decided to hire them."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-14"}

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Advertisement - story continues below","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Do you think this company helped Trump win the election as Facebook claims?","YesNo","Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge.

What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization.","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Advertisement - story continues below","Severalreports, including The New York Times’ one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.”","But as noted by Grewal in an update made Saturday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact, standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”","Founded by Tucker Carlson, a 25-year veteran of print and broadcast media, and Neil Patel, former chief policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, The Daily Caller News Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit providing original investigative reporting from a team of professional reporters that operates for the public benefit."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Some of those services may have leveraged your data to undermine the very foundations of American democracy. Hard to say!","New reports from the Guardianand New York Timesreveal how a Trump-aligned data-gathering service called Cambridge Analytica \"exploited\" information from millions of people in the lead-up to the 2016 election. It was pretty simple: The firm created a personality test app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" and people opted in to take it, granting the app permission to scrape their personal data in the process. It also harvested their friends' data.","Facebook has a lot to answer for, but in the meantime, you might be curious to see if you've given sketchy apps access to your data over the years. There's a very good chance you have: I found today that 170 apps were able to access some level of my personal Facebook data. Some of them definitely seem off.","Though Facebook is fairly transparent about what kind of data apps are able to access when you connect them to your profile, granting permission on an indefinite basis only requires a couple of taps. And until now, users might reasonably expect that simple personality quizzes or one-off games weren't being used to create a complex network for the purposes of voter manipulation.","In other words, it's a good time to check in.","Here's how to check your app settings on Facebook:","- On desktop, click the downward facing arrow in the upper-right side of your News Feed. Then, click \"Settings.\"","- From there, tap \"Apps\" in the left-hand sidebar.","- On mobile, tap the icon showing three stacked lines. The icon is on top of your screen if you're using the Android app, and it's on the bottom if you're on iOS.","- Then, tap \"Settings.\" You may need to scroll down a bit to find it. Tap \"Account Settings,\" then scroll down and tap \"Apps.\"","- Finally, tap \"Logged in with Facebook\" to see the services accessing your account.","Once you're here, you'll be able to see all of the apps you've logged into with Facebook. A lot of them, like Airbnb or Amazon, are probably fine! But others should give you pause. For example, this embarrassing Pokemon personality quiz I took years ago:","It has access to a ton of my data, including my relationship status, friend list, and birthday. Needless to say, I clicked \"Remove App\" to get rid of it.","I don't remember taking this quiz—or, tragically, which Pokemon I am—though Facebook would reasonably say I opted into it and am therefore responsible for any data I hand over to it. But I signed up for it a long time ago, likely when I was intoxicated, and who knows what it's taken from me since then.","So: Take as much responsibility for yourself and your data as you can, because it impacts your friends, too. Dig through your connected apps. Remove some of them if you must. And hey, maybe think about deleting Facebook all together.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

{"originalurl":"https://www.corpgov.net/2018/03/mark-zuckerberg-give-up-facebook-control/","title":"Mark Zuckerberg: Give Up Facebook Control - Corporate Governance","text":["Mark Zuckerberg: Give Up Facebook Control","Mark Zuckerberg, the social media titan, needs to embrace a new model of ownership and corporate governance.","As Mark Zuckerberg comes to terms with his latest public-relations disaster, he has made some interesting admissions. One is that the Facebook CEO feels “fundamentally uncomfortable sitting here in California in an office making content policy decisions for people around the world,” as he told Recode. This sentiment echoes his manifesto on the future of Facebook from earlier this year, in which he called for “a system of more local governance,” for the same reason: He can’t figure out by himself how to set standards of behavior for Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly active users.","It’s a sensible realization, and it wouldn’t be surprising if it came from anyone but Zuckerberg. This is the person, after all, who has managed to structure his company so as to retain monarchic powers despite being a minority owner. This is the company whose leading shareholders allowed that to happen. How would a company whose shareholders don’t even trust themselves ever enable meaningful user governance?","The current crisis of trust for Facebook should be a wake-up call that the tech giant—and others like it—need more appropriate structures of ownership and accountability.","Does Zuckerberg Want More Regulation?","Most of the talk about how to handle Facebook’s vast troves of valuable personal user data has revolved around regulation. Mark Zuckerberg, along with Apple’s Tim Cook, have outright invited such oversight, and Europe’s new data protections are forcing them to plan for it anyway. Commentators from Steve Bannon to Zeynep Tufekcihave called for Facebook to be treated as a public utility, like power companies and telecoms. Before legal advisors got the better of him, presumably, Zuckerberg himself used to refer to the company as a “social utility.”","Some well-placed rules might do a lot of good. But heavy regulation can also backfire. Think of what our most highly regulated, utility-scale industries look like—Comcast, PG&E, AT&T. Airlines. Big banks. Many of these are among the most hatedcompanies out there. Zealous regulation can result in regulatory capture; a few big firms can afford enough lobbyists to write their own rules, which tend to be are so onerous that they make it impossible for smaller competitors to challenge the incumbents. Regulation thus ends up subsidizing the big firms’ investor-owners and reducing the incentive for providing quality service.","We might also consider whether governments, especially the ones we currently have, can be trusted to protect our personal data. The Department of Justice, for instance, is seeking rules to ensure its ability to access data on encrypted phones; Congress has permitted ISPs to sell their customers’ personal data.","Zuckerberg Has Alternatives","There are other ways to imagine organizing a social network of Facebook’s scale—ways better aligned with Zuckerberg’s ambition of “local governance.” One of the few companies that rivals Facebook’s scope is the Associated Press, the newswire service that claims to reach over half the world’s population every day with its reports. The fact that we tend not to think of the AP in the same breath as Facebook is a signal of its success; the goal of a good platform should be that we don’t notice it.","The AP was formed in the 1840s as an association of New York City newspapers that needed to share resources like telegraph wires and horseback couriers. It has since endured its share of Facebook-like controversy; Upton Sinclair once called it “the most powerful and most sinister monopoly in America.” But a decisive turning point came with a 1945 Supreme Court decision that forced the AP to become a truly open-membership cooperative, owned and governed by the competing news agencies that use it, which run the ideological gamut from Fox News to the New York Times. It provides its member companies—including my local paper—with much-needed reportage from all over the world. In a moment of media polarization, the AP has stuck to the center by virtue of its diverse ownership structure—which is to say, the structure of its accountability.","Calls have been mounting for antitrust action against the new tech behemoths—not only Facebook, but also Amazon, Google, and others. Too rarely do these proposals involve fundamentally changing how the platforms are owned and governed.","One approach, following the AP example, would be to reorganize Facebook into an association of diverse, interoperable social networks among which users could choose. The central company would act as a kind of franchiser, managing the core technology and underlying infrastructure; the smaller member-owner companies would compete for users by offering varied options on matters of ad deployment, data standards, content filtering, and even interface design. Like the internet’s most essential and resilient social network—email—the result would be a blend of unity and diversity. Like AP, also, Facebook would be insulated from the day-to-day economic temptations of the ad business.","The technology for such “federated” social networks has existed for years; the trouble is that the allure of monopolism has so far prevented more competitive models from flourishing.","A second approach might involve a more direct form of user-ownership, in which the company as a whole remains unified but individual Facebook users, together, wield significant ownership and governance powers. This would be especially well-aligned with one of Zuckerberg’s stated ambitions: “I hope that we can explore examples of how collective decision-making might work at scale.” Handling such governance would not be easy, but already large-scale co-ops and mutuals—think REI and Northwestern Mutual—do a fairly good job of serving member interests without being toppled by the fleeting whims of the crowd. The electric utility co-ops that supply electricity to much of rural America receive consistently higher customer service ratings than their investor-owned counterparts. If companies like Facebook are going to hold the data of our daily lives, the surest route to security and a sustainable business is for us to hold a stake in those companies in turn.","The path to either of these outcomes is not easy or clear. They are goals to work toward, not short-term fixes. And achieving them will require a mix of policy intervention and ingenuity. Perhaps the process could begin with Zuckerberg’s promised stock sell-off. One way or another, it is time to look beyond the ownership structures the online economy currently has to the ones we need for a healthier future.","Zuckerberg Must Change the Nature of Facebook","The Cambridge Analytica case now plaguing Facebook is not a hack or a breach; it’s the rule, not an exception. It’s a symptom of a problem we already knew we had but were content to ignore. Facebook, Google, Amazon, and firms like them hold reams of data about us whose potential for abuse—if not now, in the future—may exceed the companies’ incentive to act in our interests. As online networks mature from dorm-room experiments to social utilities, our expectations should mature with them. Even Zuckerberg seems to realize that his network isn’t just his anymore. We give it value by acting like it is ours, by sharing our lives like it is ours. The nature of the company should reflect this.","I’m delighted to publish Nathan Schneider’s timely article on Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. I am among those shareholders perennially filing to change Facebook’s dual class share structure. What is happening is to be expected when user’s have little ability to own and manage our personal data and one person is in unchecked “control.”","George Washington stepped down to ensure continued separation or powers for the United States. Zuckerberg now leads a much larger monopoly power. For the sake of democracy and humanity, Zuckerberg must transform Facebook by using a more democratic structure."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

It turns out, some of the information Facebook gathers is, frankly, quite scary.","I downloaded my Facebook history and was amazed, perhaps shocked is a better word, at what was in my profile - personal information that others thought was hidden. Here's how to access your full history and how to look through it.","Given recent events, I was curious to find out what information Facebook had connected to my profile. So, I started by accessing my archive. And once I was in, I found that Facebook was sharing information with me that was meant to be hidden from me.","How to download your Facebook history","Accessing your history is quite straightforward.","Log into Facebook using a web browser (I could find how to do this via the iOS app).","Near the top-left area of the screen, there's a downward-pointing triangle. Click on it and then choose the settings option that's second from the bottom of the menu.","At the Botton of the list of items in the main section of the display, click the \"Download a copy of your Facebook data\" option.","Once you've done that, you'll see a new screen with a green \"Download archive\" as well as an instruction to protect your archive. That's ironic given how well Facebook has protected our data.","The process of creating the archive takes a while but you'll receive a Facebook notification and an email telling you when it's done. You can then receive a zipped archive of your Facebook history.","Accessing your history","Once you unzip the archive, you'll end up with a new directory of files and folders. There's no need to scroll through each folder. Just open the folder that was created when you unzipped the archive. It will be called \"facebook-username\". Mine contained four folders and one file.","That file, index.html, is the one you need to open. When you do that, the file will open in a browser window, presenting you with a simple website with all your content.","Down the left side, you'll see links to","Profile","Contact Info","Timeline","Photos","Videos","Friends","Messages","Events","Security","Ads","Places Created","Applications","Clicking on each of these will reveal various parts of your history that have been retained by Facebook.","Here's the scary bit","I started by taking a look at the Contact Info section. Incredibly, five of the first six contacts on the list were not my Facebook friends. Yet I had their names and phone numbers right there in my contacts. The name at the top of the list was someone I only met and communicated with, completely outside Facebook, for the first time last week. My contact with that person was via email on various devices and over the phone from my iPhone.","The second name on the list is someone I've had the occasional business interaction with the other three people I have no recollection of every speaking to or meeting.","Yet Facebook has shared their personal information with me.","When I called the first person on the list, they were surprised I had access to that information as, even though they had put their phone number into Facebook, they had only elected to share it with friends.","When I looked at their profile on Facebook, their phone number was hidden from me. Yet, it was available through my archived history. In fact, when that person checked, he had locked his account down so that the number wasn't even available to his friends. I followed this up with another party on my list who was similarly shocked.","In other words, Facebook is making data accessible to me that the owner has explicitly tried to keep hidden.","I contacted the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) to find out whether this was a potential breach of the Privacy Act. They declined to make a comment but did provide a statement, saying","I am aware of the reports that users’ Facebook profile information was acquired and used without authorisation. My Office is making inquiries with Facebook to ascertain whether any personal information of Australians was involved.","I've also asked Facebook for a comment but, at the time of publication, they haven't come back to me. If they do, I'll publish a response.","The problem is that Facebook is giving you new information about people you once had contact with. I looked through my archive contacts and noticed that I had updated phone numbers for people I haven't been in touch with for years, and who aren't in my current phone contacts. So I noticed a guy I knew 10 years ago - before Facebook - who I had an Australian phone number for. That number got slurped by Facebook, and it appears when he moved overseas, Facebook updated his number with his new US number and supplied that to me in my archive.","This is potentially very dangerous for people keeping a low profile for family or other reasons as Facebook is joining the dots across multiple platforms and contact lists.","Only with real examples will people start to understand what it means when they give up their privacy.","This is a breach of laws, and trust.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.","SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook’s recent crisis is just one of many privacy issues that company has had to deal with in its relatively short existence.","Barely two years old in 2006, the company faced user outrage when it introduced its News Feed. A year later it had to apologize for telling people what their friends had bought. Years after that, the Federal Trade Commission stepped in — and is now looking at the company again. Facebook has a history of running afoul of regulators and weathering user anger, all the while collecting record profits and racking up more than 2 billion users.","Those privacy issues are now front and center. Facebook's loose handling of how its data was acquired by app developers has plunged the company into the biggest crisis of its 14-year existence. The revelation that a data analytics company used by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was able to surreptitiously collect data on 50 million people through a seemingly innocuous quiz app has forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to issue a public apology — and promise changes.","Taking a step back to look at Facebook’s pattern of privacy issues provides an important perspective on just how many times the company has faced serious criticism. What follows is a rundown of the biggest privacy issues Facebook has faced to date:","When: September 2006","What: Facebook debuts News Feed","Facebook’s response: Tells users to relax","Facebook was only two years old when it introduced News Feed on Sept. 5, 2006. The curated feed was intended as a central destination so users didn't have to browse through friends' profiles to see what they had changed.","Facebook had about 8 million users at the time, and not all of them were happy about every move of their personal life being blasted into a daily feed for their friends.","“One of the things I'm most proud of about Facebook is that we believe things can always be better, and we're willing to make big bets if we think it will help our community over the long term,” Zuckerberg said in a post reflecting on the 10th anniversary of News Feed.","The outrage died down, and News Feed became a major part of Facebook’s success.","“We were excited about Beacon because we believe a lot of information people want to share isn’t on Facebook, and if we found the right balance, Beacon would give people an easy and controlled way to share more of that information with their friends,” he said.","Regulators said Facebook falsely claimed that third-party apps were able to access only the data they needed to operate. In fact, the apps could access nearly all of a user’s personal data. Facebook users that never authenticated a third-party app could even have private posts collected if their friends used apps. Facebook was also charged with sharing user information with advertisers, despite a promise they wouldn’t.","\"Facebook is obligated to keep the promises about privacy that it makes to its hundreds of millions of users,\" Jon Leibowitz, then chairman of the FTC, said at the time. \"Facebook's innovation does not have to come at the expense of consumer privacy. The FTC action will ensure it will not.\"","As part of the agreement in 2011, Facebook remains liable for a $16,000-per-day penalty for violating each count of the settlement.","When: June 2013","What: Facebook bug exposes private contact info","Facebook’s response: Facebook fixes bug, notifies people whose info may have been exposed.","A bug exposed the email addresses and phone numbers of 6 million Facebook users to anyone who had some connection to the person or knew at least one piece of their contact information.","The bug was discovered by a White Hat hacker — someone who hacks with the intention of helping companies find bugs and build better security practices.","When people joined Facebook and uploaded their contact lists, Facebook explained it would match that data to other people on Facebook in order to create friend recommendations.","“For example, we don’t want to recommend that people invite contacts to join Facebook if those contacts are already on Facebook; instead, we want to recommend that they invite those contacts to be their friends on Facebook,” Facebook’s team explained in a June 2013 message.","That information was “inadvertently stored in association with people’s contact information,” Facebook said. That meant that when a Facebook user chose to download their information through Facebook’s DYI tool, they were provided with a list of additional contact information for people they knew or with whom they may have had some association.","Facebook said it pulled the tool offline and fixed it. The company also said it had notified regulators and pledged to tell affected users.","When: July 2014","What: Mood-manipulation experiment on thousands of Facebook users","Facebook’s response: Facebook data scientist apologizes","Facebook's mood-manipulation experiment in 2014 included more than half a million randomly selected users. Facebook altered their news feeds to show more positive or negative posts. The purpose of the study was to show how emotions could spread on social media. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, kicking off a firestorm of backlash over whether the study was ethical.","“I can understand why some people have concerns about it, and my co-authors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused,” he wrote, according to The New York Times.","When: April 2015","What: Facebook cuts off apps from taking basically all the data they want","Chris Wylie, from Canada, who once worked for the UK-based political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, gives a talk entitled \"The Most Important Whistleblower Since Snowden: The Mind Behind Cambridge Analytica\" at the Frontline Club in London on March 20, 2018.Matt Dunham / AP","When Paul Grewal, Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel announced Cambridge Analytica’s ban from Facebook last week, he said Facebook has a policy of doing ongoing manual and automated checks to ensure apps are complying with Facebook policies.","“These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps,” he said.","When: January 2018","What: Europe’s data protection law","Facebook’s response: Facebook complies","Facebook has also began preparing for the start of a strict European data protection law that takes effect in May. Called the General Data Protection Regulation, the law governs how companies store user information and requires them to disclose a breach within 72 hours.","One particularly notable principle many will be watching to see if Facebook upholds is accountability.","\"In addition to comprehensive privacy reviews, we put products through rigorous data security testing. We also meet with regulators, legislators and privacy experts around the world to get input on our data practices and policies,\" Facebook's team said in January.","When: February 2018","What: Belgian court tells Facebook to stop tracking people across the entire internet","Facebook said it has complied with European data protection laws and gives people the choice to opt out of data collection on third-party websites and applications. The company said it would appeal the ruling.","When: March 2018","What: Revealed that Facebook knew about massive data theft and did nothing","Facebook’s response: An apology tour and policy changes","The world finally got the answer to the question “Where’s Zuck?” on Wednesday when the Facebook CEO and co-founder broke his silence on the data harvesting allegations. In a statement posted on his Facebook wall, Zuckerberg avoided the word “sorry” but did express partial blame for Facebook’s role in not doing enough to protect user privacy.","He laid out three steps Facebook will take now, including investigating all apps that were able to access user data before 2014, when the company began changing its permissions for developers. Facebook will put restrictions on the data apps can access, limiting them to a person’s name, photo and email. Finally, Zuckerberg said Facebook will make an easy tool that lets everyone see which apps have access to their data and allow them to revoke access.","\"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again,” he wrote. “The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago.

The Guardian reported that the data was collected through an app called “thisisyourdigitallife,” built by a Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge academic.","Facebook says that everyone whose data are in the Cambridge Analytica set “knowingly provided their information.”","“Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent,” Facebook’s Paul Grewal, a deputy general counsel, wrote. “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","It turns out that before 2014, Facebook used to let app developers obtain data from users and their connections when they used Facebook to log into an app.","This is exceedingly common — I checked my own Facebook account and realized that I had given over 200 apps access to my personal data.","I had allowed way more apps to access my Facebook data than I initially expected — 231 apps in total.","Even worse, I was letting apps my Facebook friends installed take some of my Facebook data, too, including my current city, and my likes.","While some of the apps I connected to Facebook were legitimate services, like Spotify or Airbnb, a lot of them were dumb one-off quizzes I took years ago.

{"originalurl":"https://scroll.in/article/873267/aadhaar-analytica-why-both-data-protection-scandals-should-deeply-disturb-everyone","title":"Aadhaar Analytica: Why both data protection scandals should deeply disturb everyone","text":["Arguing that Facebook collects more data than Aadhaar is both naive and misses the point.","The Bharatiya Janata Party-run government and other supporters of the Aadhaar project seem to have taken the recent Facebook-Cambridge Analytica revelations as an opportunity rather than a warning sign. The controversy, which involves the Facebook user data of more than 50 million people being used by the political consulting firm to create strategies for Donald Trump’s election campaign in the US, stands as proof that Aadhaar is the least of our data protection troubles, they claim. The real danger, as far as these people are concerned, lies elsewhere.","“Forget Aadhaar, Facebook threat real,” said the headline to one column by Sunil Jain in the Financial Express. Another piece in the Pioneer says there is “collective hypocrisy” from those who have misgivings about Aadhaar but have not spoken up about the danger posed by social networks. “We are outraging over Aadhaar and its threats to privacy, when the GAFA foursome knows the colour of our underpants,” writes R Jagannathan in Swarajya, referring to Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.","The government may not have drawn the connection explicitly, but it was impossible not to compare the two when IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was wagging his finger at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on the same day that Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Supreme Court that Aadhaar data was safe because it sat behind tall, thick walls. On Sunday, Tourism Minister KJ Alphons offered up a different variant of this, saying Indians have no problem “getting naked” for the white man, but claim that their privacy has been breached when asked to give their fingerprints to their government.","Question of consent","There is one obvious response to this false comparison: consent. For whatever it is worth, Facebook, and others like Google and Amazon, are voluntary services, which an individual may choose to engage with and provide their data to. Aadhaar was supposed to be voluntary too, but this government has made it mandatory not just to have a Unique Identity number but also link it with a huge number of services.","This means that the government can make it impossible for Indians to get services that they are due without Aadhaar, whether those are food rations, their provident fund accounts or a phone connection. Being off Facebook does not take away any of anyone’s rights or access to public services. At a basic level, Facebook cannot influence the relationship between Indians and the government. Aadhaar seeks to define that relationship.","But in some ways that response alone is not adequate.","For one, optional services like Facebook and Google are so large at this point that many see them almost as utilities. They may not be mandatory, but vast swathes of those who are online can be expected to have interacted with either Google or Facebook at some point. Attempting to stay away from either seems nearly impossible. So it might be disingenuous to rely too much on the consent argument.","Linking to other services","That said, the pro-Aadhaar argument rests on the belief that Facebook and Google scoop up as much information about individuals as they possible can. The services want to look at users’ photos, know whom they talk to, gauge their political views and spy on everything they read, listen to and watch. Aadhaar, per this view, simply collects names, addresses, a few more demographic details, and biometrics. How could that be dangerous?","The answer is linking. Aadhaar is built on providing each resident a single 12-digit number that serves as their ID. This number is then seeded across multiple databases, from the public distribution system to schools and colleges to utility corporations. Many private companies, from banks to telecom service providers to insurance agencies also collect Aadhaar numbers now, in a manner that could help them build customer profile databases that could have serious implications for everything from what prices or interest rates Indians are quoted to whether they can get insurance and be admitted at a hospital. In effect, UIDAI itself may have collected only some information for each individual, but the ability to track individuals across multiple databases is what makes the Aadhaar project as disturbing as Facebook and Google.","Non-binary discussion","Most importantly, this is not a binary discussion. Facebook and Google are not pitted against each other in a zero-sum contest to see which one can collect and store more information about Indians. The two can easily end up being used together and the combination of data controlled by all of these entities would be even more disturbing from a privacy angle. Apple’s recent decision to host iCloud services in China have raised concerns about an authoritarian government forcing private services to hand over their data.","The Cambridge Analytica scandal is no balm, allowing us to be sanguine about Aadhaar fears as being a lesser evil than the bigger data breaches abroad. Instead, they should both serve as deafening alarm bells that tell us how being able to protect our data from the prying eyes, either of private companies or the government, is one of the most important issues of our times. India is currently in the process of trying to figure out a data protection regulatory regime. If anything, rather than trying to compare the two scandals, citizens should be using the fears about Cambridge Analytica and Aadhaar to push for data protection rules that are as strong, clear cut and transparent as possible."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But why does least-liked tech company Facebook have all this data about its users in the first place?","Let’s put aside Instagram, WhatsApp and other Facebook products for a minute. Facebook has built the world’s biggest social network. But that’s not what they sell. You’ve probably heard the internet saying “if a product is free, it means that you are the product.”","And it’s particularly true in this case because Facebook is the world’s second biggest advertising company in the world behind Google. During the last quarter of 2017, Facebook reported $12.97 billion in revenue, including $12.78 billion from ads.","That’s 98.5 percent of Facebook’s revenue coming from ads.","Ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing. But Facebook has reached ad saturation in the newsfeed. So the company has two options — creating new products and ad formats, or optimizing those sponsored posts.","Facebook has reached ad saturation in the newsfeed","This isn’t a zero-sum game — Facebook has been doing both at the same time. That’s why you’re seeing more ads on Instagram and Messenger. And that’s also why ads on Facebook seem more relevant than ever.","If Facebook can show you relevant ads and you end up clicking more often on those ads, then advertisers will pay Facebook more money.","So Facebook has been collecting as much personal data about you as possible — it’s all about showing you the best ad. The company knows your interests, what you buy, where you go and who you’re sleeping with.","You can’t hide from Facebook","Facebook’s terms and conditions are a giant lie. They are purposely misleading, too long and too broad. So you can’t just read the company’s terms of service and understand what it knows about you.","That’s why some people have been downloading their Facebook data. You can do it too, it’s quite easy. Just head over to your Facebook settings and click the tiny link that says “Download a copy of your Facebook data.”","All of this is by design and you agreed to it. Facebook has unified terms of service and share user data across all its apps and services (except WhatsApp data in Europe for now). So if you follow a clothing brand on Instagram, you could see an ad from this brand on Facebook.com.","Messaging apps are privacy traps","But Facebook has also been using this trick quite a lot with Messenger. You might not remember, but the on-boarding experience on Messenger is really aggressive.","On iOS, the app shows you a fake permission popup to access your address book that says “Ok” or “Learn More”. The company is using a fake popup because you can’t ask for permission twice.","There’s a blinking arrow below the OK button.","If you click on “Learn More”, you get a giant blue button that says “Turn On”. Everything about this screen is misleading and Messenger tries to manipulate your emotions.","“Messenger only works when you have people to talk to,” it says. Nobody wants to be lonely, that’s why Facebook implies that turning on this option will give you friends.","Even worse, it says “if you skip this step, you’ll need to add each contact one-by-one to message them.” This is simply a lie as you can automatically talk to your Facebook friends using Messenger without adding them one-by-one.","The next time you pay for a burrito with your credit card, Facebook will learn about this transaction and match this credit card number with the one you added in Messenger","If you tap on “Not Now”, Messenger will show you a fake notification every now and then to push you to enable contact syncing. If you tap on yes and disable it later, Facebook still keeps all your contacts on its servers.","Even if you disable it later, Facebook will keep this data for later reference.","But Facebook doesn’t stop there. The company knows a lot more about you than what you can find in your downloaded archive. The company asks you to share your location with your friends. The company tracks your web history on nearly every website on earth using embedded JavaScript.","But my favorite thing is probably peer-to-peer payments. In some countries, you can pay back your friends using Messenger. It’s free! You just have to add your card to the app.","It turns out that Facebook also buys data about your offline purchases. The next time you pay for a burrito with your credit card, Facebook will learn about this transaction and match this credit card number with the one you added in Messenger.","In other words, Messenger is a great Trojan horse designed to learn everything about you.","And the next time an app asks you to share your address book, there’s a 99-percent chance that this app is going to mine your address book to get new users, spam your friends, improve ad targeting and sell email addresses to marketing companies.","I could say the same thing about all the other permission popups on your phone. Be careful when you install an app from the Play Store or open an app for the first time on iOS. It’s easier to enable something if a feature doesn’t work without it than to find out that Facebook knows everything about you.","GDPR to the rescue","There’s one last hope. And that hope is GDPR. I encourage you to read TechCrunch’s Natasha Lomas excellent explanation of GDPR to understand what the European regulation is all about.","Many of the misleading things that are currently happening at Facebook will have to change. You can’t force people to opt in like in Messenger. Data collection should be minimized to essential features. And Facebook will have to explain why it needs all this data to its users.","If Facebook doesn’t comply, the company will have to pay up to 4 percent of its global annual turnover. But that doesn’t stop you from actively reclaiming your online privacy right now.","You can’t be invisible on the internet, but you have to be conscious about what’s happening behind your back. Every time a company asks you to tap OK, think about what’s behind this popup. You can’t say that nobody told you."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The idea, in theory, would let Snapchat users grant outside companies access to their Snapchat data to help personalize other services.","Mashable saw a beta version of Snapchat with a new section called “Connected Apps,” with text that reads, “These apps are connected to your Snapchat account. Choose an app to control what it has access to.”","Snapchat currently has an advertising API so people can buy ads through third-party dashboards, but it doesn’t let people use their Snapchat account on other apps, or help people connect with their Snapchat friends on other platforms.","Facebook does, and has for years. An old version of that API, which allowed outside developers to collect data from users without their consent, is at the center of the company’s entire Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The fact that Snapchat is considering sharing some data with outsiders is interesting in general, but particularly interesting given the recent news about Facebook.","There are a lot more questions than answers about the potential product. For example, what would connecting your Snapchat account to another app actually grant that developer? Would they have access to your contact list or private Snap messages? Would Snapchat let you post back to your account from other services?","A Snap spokesperson declined to comment, and the company is likely thinking a lot about those very questions, given the current climate around privacy sharing. Hopefully, Snapchat will learn from Facebook‘s mistakes whenever it decides to roll this out.","Until now, Snap has stayed pretty far out of the spotlight when it comes to data collection and user privacy, probably because so many of the interactions on Snap are in private messages. (And many of its users are smartphone natives who may better understand what they’re handing over— or simply not care.)","But Snap is also an advertising company like Facebook, and it collects a lot of data about its users so it can show them relevant ads. You can read about some of that here.","The fact that it’s considering an API is also a reminder of why Facebook continues to collect this kind of stuff about its own user base, despite the issues it’s facing — if Facebook isn’t going to do it, somebody else will."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

It was at the time the most expensive U.S. Senate race in history with total spending of more than $121 million.","Cambridge Analytica’s data told Tillis to highlight Hagan’s absences on the Senate Armed Services Committee to reach a certain group of voters. Tillis hammered Hagan in ads and debates on her absences and the rise of ISIS and jumped on her acknowledgement that she skipped a national security meeting to attend a fundraiser.","“We were able to design and deploy messages tailored to these audiences according to their particular psychographic profiles.

I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.\"","Stamos advocated investigating and revealing manipulation of news at the social network by Russian entities, to the chagrin of other top executives, the Times reported, citing unnamed current and former employees.","Senator Ron Wyden asked Facebook to provide more information on what he called a \"troubling\" misuse of private data that could have been used to sway voters.","Wyden said he wants to know how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook tools \"to weaponise detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.\"","In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage.","Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations \"horrifying, if confirmed,\" and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week.","According to a joint investigation by The New York Times and Britain's Observer, Cambridge Analytica was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's Information Commissioner who regulates the sector in the country, announced her office would seek a court warrant on Tuesday to search Cambridge Analytica's computer servers.","She said the company had been \"uncooperative\" to requests for access to its records and missed a Monday deadline stipulated.","Meanwhile, Facebook said it has hired a digital forensics firm to examine how the data leak occurred and to ensure that any data collected had been destroyed.","Facebook shares skidded 6.8 per cent by the close of the Nasdaq amid concerns about pressure for new regulations that could hurt its business model.","Shares slipped another per cent or so to US$170 in after-market trades.","Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media, said the disclosures will increase pressure to regulate Facebook and other social media firms, already under scrutiny for allowing disinformation from Russian-directed sources to propagate.","\"Self-regulation is not working,\" Grygiel said.","Daniel Kreiss, a professor of media and communications at the University of North Carolina, said Facebook failed to live up to its responsibilities on election ads.","\"The fact that Facebook seems to make no distinction between selling sneakers and selling a presidential platform is a deep problem,\" Kreiss said.","Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research maintained that the revelations highlight \"systemic problems at Facebook,\" but that they won't immediately impact the social network's revenues.","David Carroll, a media professor at the Parsons School of Design, said Facebook and others will soon be forced to live with new privacy rules such as those set to take effect in the European Union.","\"Facebook and Google will have to ask users a lot more permission to track them,\" Carroll said. \"Most people are going to say no, so I think it's going to have a huge impact on these companies.\"","Carroll has filed a legal action in Britain calling on Cambridge Analytica to disclose what data was gathered and used on him.","An undercover investigation of Cambridge Analytica by Britain's Channel 4 said executives boasted they could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and Ukrainian sex workers, and spread misinformation online.","The executives claimed to have worked in more 200 elections across the world, including Argentina, the Czech Republic, India, Kenya and Nigeria.","The British firm said it \"strongly denies\" the claims from Channel 4 as well as reports on misuse of Facebook data.","\"Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign,\" a statement read.","ADVERTISEMENT","POST A COMMENT","HOUSE RULES","1.

By midday, the company’s share price losses had multiplied to more than $40bn, making the day its worst in more than five years.","Theresa May’s spokesman said she backed an investigation by the information commissioner, which was prompted by a whistleblower who told the Observer how Cambridge Analytica had harvested millions of Facebook profiles to influence voters through “psychographic” targeting.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","The European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, said on Monday that the institution would investigate fully. Tajani urged the social media company to take more responsibility, saying on Twitter that “allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens’ privacy rights”.","In the US, a state attorney general has called for investigations, greater accountability and regulation, while the head of the parliamentary committee in the UK investigating fake news accused Cambridge Analytica and Facebook of misleading MPs, with the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport warning of an end to the “wild west” of technology firms.","Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach","Read more","“The allegations are clearly very concerning. It’s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way,” May’s spokesman said.","“So it is absolutely right the information commissioner is investigating this matter and we expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.”","In a statement Facebook said: “We have hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems. We remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Cambridge Analytica said: “In 2014 we received Facebook data and derivatives of Facebook data from another company, GSR, that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research. After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook.","The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, told the House of Commons that the revelations were “clearly very worrying” and the government was considering additional powers that the commissioner had proposed, including powers to impose further criminal sanctions and to compel testimony from individuals. Hancock said he was shocked at the speed at which Facebook had barred the whistleblower, Chris Wylie, from its platforms, including WhatsApp.","“I thought it was outrageous,” he said. “Facebook have some serious questions to answer here, and they will tell their side of the story. And to answer it by blocking an account, when we know in this house they do not act fast enough to block other accounts of obviously outrageous behaviour, I’ll tell you what, it shows that when they need to they can block things incredibly quickly and they will need to do a lot more that.”","However, Hancock said he had not seen any evidence that the activities had had an effect on the outcome of any election or referendum.","Labour’s Stephen Kinnock said that if Cambridge Analytica were proved to have been “in flagrant breach of our electoral rules, that would place a pretty huge question mark over the referendum result”.","Damian Collins MP, who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would call the heads of both companies, Mark Zuckerberg and Alexander Nix, to give further testimony.","“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","Collins suggested the powers of the information commissioner should be beefed up to add the legal ability to force companies to provide information.","Downing Street said it would consider any formal requests to give new powers to the commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, but added her powers had only recently been reviewed.","“I haven’t seen any formal requests. The information commissioner does have significant powers, which have been enhanced in recent times, but if any formal requests were made to us I’m sure we’d consider it,” the spokesman said.","Last month both Facebook representatives and Nix had told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from Global Science Research (GSR). But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.","Profile","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica","Nix worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman.","Controversies","Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.

Perez “said that what he saw and experienced in Afghanistan sent his life off the rails,” leading him to struggle with PTSD and addiction. Like so many of our veterans, he needed help. Instead, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “escorted [him] across the US-Mexico border from Texas and handed [him] over to Mexican authorities Friday”:","Perez, his family and supporters, who include Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, had argued that his wartime service to the country had earned him the right to stay in the United States and to receive mental health treatment for the PTSD and substance abuse.","\"This case is a tragic example of what can happen when national immigration policies are based more in hate than on logic and ICE doesn't feel accountable to anyone,\" Duckworth said in a statement following reports of Perez's deportation. \"At the very least, Miguel should have been able to exhaust all of his legal options before being rushed out of the country under a shroud of secrecy.\"","Duckworth, who had introduced a “private bill” to stop Perez’s deportation, told NBC News that he had lived here as a legal resident since age 11, but was not a citizen. Service members are fast tracked for citizenship, but Perez’s attorney said the soldier had assumed it was automatic. When he tried a retroactive application, it was denied due to the conviction, for which he was sentenced to 15 years and served half. In her tweet, Duckworth said that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen did not respond to her personal appeal to look at his case. Perez’s attorney told NBC News that the dad of two U.S. citizens was deported “with no money and only his orange prison uniform”:","\"He was dumped in one of the most dangerous areas of the Mexican border,\" Bergen said. \"We will continue to fight his case and appeal his citizenship denial.\"","Nielsen could’ve stopped this deportation. ICE could’ve. Donald Trump himself could’ve. They didn’t. “We broke him, did not help him, and when he tried to help himself, we punished him,” said Congressman Bobby Rush (D-IL). “Beyond the injustice ICE has laid on Mr. Perez Montes in his deportation,” Duckworth said in a statement just before Perez was kicked out to a country he hadn’t called home for decades, “I would find it shocking to learn that he will potentially be leaving with nothing but the clothes on his back.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S.

I'm Alex Goldman.","PJ VOGT: And I'm PJ Vogt.","ALEX: PJ.","PJ: Yes.","ALEX: Hi.","PJ: Hello.","ALEX: So over the course of maybe the past year, we've gotten a fair amount of emails from people who think that Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, are using the microphone on their phone to listen to their conversations and advertise stuff to them, based on the things they're saying.","PJ: Yeah, I have also gotten some of these messages. I've- I basically have felt like I don't — I think it would be such a risky thing for Facebook thing to do, they've been like, \"Oh, it's probably just a coincidence, and people are imagining stuff.\"","ALEX: Yeah, but I've been talking to this guy named JP, and some of the stories that he's been telling me are super hard to dismiss. He told me that he that he first started noticing this happening at the beginning of the year.","JP: I was baking pizza dough. I was, you know, making pizza dough, and I said, \"This would be a lot easier if we had one of those fancy Kitchenaid mixers.\" Ten minutes later, there's an ad for Kitchenaid mixers on sale.ALEX: Okay wow.","[MUSIC]","ALEX: Not long after that, JP is in Target, with his partner Gary, and he yells down the aisle \"Hey, can you pick up some Red Bull?\"","JP: And then I opened Instagram on the way home, you know, I wasn’t driving, I was in the passenger's seat, (laughs) and there was an ad for four new flavors of Red Bull. “Try them now.”ALEX: (laughs)JP: And I was like, “This is insane. This is crazy.” You know, they just kept coming. And I was like, \"Let's try something funny.\" And like we would say something ridiculous, like, \"Man, I could really use a pair of really sexy underwear.\" And like, these weird mesh underwear ads started showing up in our feeds. And it was nonstop","ALEX : And then JP told me a story that just felt really crazy. Let’s call it the perfume story.","[MUSIC]","JP: The thing that really got us, was uh — my partner's mom came to visit from Oklahoma, a very nice lady, but, you know, doesn't travel that often.","ALEX: Her name’s Debbie, and she was going to visit JP and Gary in San Francisco. And on her way there, she gets a bottle of perfume confiscated by the TSA. So, when she arrives in San Francisco, she says, “Hey, I want to go the perfume store and get a new bottle of perfume.”","JP: And my partner and I, we don't wear colognes, we've never bought perfume that I know of, never search for it. And within 30 minutes, he had opened his Facebook and there was an ad for a women’s perfume store in San Francisco.","PJ: That's weird.","ALEX: Yes! It’s weird!","[MUSIC]","ALEX: On a scale of like, 1-10, what would you say your belief that this is actually your phone listening to you?JP: Uh, 10. I’m convinced.ALEX: Wow. OK.JP: And it just, it creeps me out. And I have no idea how to stop it. I actually- this week, removed the Facebook app and Facebook Messenger and Instagram from my phone, and now I just have links to the websites. I’m like, this close to just deleting my account.","[MUSIC]","ALEX: So naturally, the first thing I did was contact Facebook. Ask them for an interview.","PJ: They said no.","ALEX: They said, “No, we won’t do an interview. And also, listening to people’s conversations via the microphone on their phone to target ads to them is not something Facebook does.” They said that unequivocally.","PJ: Right. Which... Again, I don’t think they do it, but if you’re a person who does, you’re like, “Well, of course they would say that. Why are they going to tell you about how they’re secretly spying on you?”","ALEX: Um, right. But the thing is that Facebook wouldn’t offer me a satisfactory explanation as to why these ads were showing up in JP’s feed. So, I looked into this, and after doing some reporting, I realized the reason they don't want to talk to me about this is probably because the technology they use to target people with ads is really invasive. I talked to the guy who first built that technology. His name is Antonio Garcia Martinez. He’s since left Facebook, but he started at the company back in 2011.","ALEX: So just to be clear, there was no targeted ads division before you, right?ANTONIO GARCIA MARTINEZ: (laughs) You use the term division like a whole part of the company. It was literally me and three engineers.ALEX: Okay.ANTONIO: Remember, the only Facebook ads were those little postage stamp sized little turds on the right hand side, on the right hand bar. There was no commercial content in feed.","Antonio’s big insight was that they’d make way more money if they just squeezed more information out of their users. And the most obvious piece of information was location. People’s devices were telling Facebook where they were, and the targeted ads team could weaponize that.","ANTONIO: All of location targeting was the responsibility of one guy. He’s a friend of mine, a guy named Pierre. He’s a kind of weird, quirky, idiosyncratic French dude. And he would basically take, you know, the lat/long data off your mobile phone, your check ins, um, you know, IP address lookups, if you’re logging in from a laptop or a desktop machine. And that would kind of go into Pierre’s magic location machine, and out would come a location.","ALEX: Location is important to Facebook because A) Just where you live tells them a ton about the kind of stuff you’re probably interested in. And B) if you suddenly appear in a different location, a location that Facebook doesn't recognize, then it knows that you're traveling.","PJ: So like, with the perfume story, it's like she was telling them that she was traveling even if she didn't realize she was telling them that.","ALEX: Yes.","PJ: Interesting.","ALEX: And so the next thing I learned was that in 2012, Antonio came up with what is probably his enduring legacy at Facebook — the thing that he will be remembered forever for.","PJ: Which is what?","ALEX: So he wanted to figure out a way to keep tracking people after they left Facebook. Like, to be able to see what they were doing all across the internet. And so he developed this thing that’s now called Facebook Pixel, and it’s installed on millions of websites. So when you go to one of these sites with Facebook Pixel on it, it watches what you do and reports that information back to Facebook. It can see how long you linger on a certain webpage, it can see if you purchase something, it can see if you put something in your cart on a website and decide not to buy it. It’s kind of like an internet surveillance camera.","PJ: Got- so that’s why like, that’s why, like, when you look at a pair of shoes or whatever- it follows you around Facebook.","ALEX: It follows you around the internet. Right. There's this app that I use called Ghostery that shows you if Pixel is on a site that you’re visiting. And it'll also show you all the other ad trackers that are on that site. Like, if you go to the New York Times website, there may be 30 or 40 of these trackers.","PJ: Like, as soon as there’s an ad, you basically have to picture 30 or 40 like helpful friendly sales associates like following you around the store–","ALEX: (laughs)","PJ: –trying to guess how much money’s in your wallet, like, guessing your like weight and age, and like being like, “Oh, he looked at the hooded sweatshirt, oh my god, OK, OK, write that down, write that down, he likes hoodies.”","ALEX: Right, So by 2012, the targeted ads division has figured out how to follow you all around the Internet. They have all this info on everything you’re purchasing, everything you think about purchasing.","But once they figured out they could do this, they got, like, data hungry. They weren’t just interested in the information that you could give them online, they wanted to know things about what you were doing offline. And so they figured out a way to buy your personal history.","PJ: So it’s like, I have a file on Alex Goldman. I’ll go buy Alex Goldman’s credit report. I mean, probably not that but–","ALEX: No, yeah. I mean, we don’t know exactly what Facebook is buying, because they’re a black box, but we do know that they’re buying from companies that sell credit reports.","PJ: Really?","ALEX: Yes. I talked to this reporter from ProPublica, her name is Julia Angwin. She’s investigated a lot of this stuff.","ALEX: Wait, where are they buying this stuff?JULIA ANGWIN: Oh you can buy this from these delightful places. Uh, one of them just had a big breach, Equifax, you may have heard of them.ALEX: Yeah, Equifax. Right.JULIA: Experian, Axiom. You know, there's about- there's tons of them.There’s probably about seven or 10 big ones out there who sell information about your income, the square footage of your house- within 25 square feet.","ALEX: Whether your name has showed up in a lawsuit. They know your income. And you know those loyalty programs that like supermarkets and pharmacies have? The data brokers often run those programs. So they know how often you’re buying diapers or cold medicine or birth control.","PJ: So like, if Debbie had like, a loyalty card at like, her local perfume store. They would know like, this is the type of perfume she buys. And even like, in theory it's like, they would know like, oh and she bought it like eight months ago. Like, she's due for some new like, eau de Debbie, or whatever.","ALEX: (laughs) Absolutely. They're basically learning everything they can about you, and then they break your personality and your interests down into all these hyper-specific traits. And Julia told me there are a ton of these.","JULIA: So, we were able to put together a big database of about 52,000 attributes that Facebook was collecting about its users.ALEX: (laughs) Oh my god.JULIA: Right.ALEX: 52,000?JULIA: So they had some categories that were just mind boggling. There was one that was just my favorite called, “a person who likes to pretend to text in awkward situations.”ALEX: (laughs) How did they even figure that out?JULIA: I have no idea.","ALEX: There's actually a page on Facebook where you can see how Facebook categorizes you.","PJ: I want to check mine.","ALEX: Ok, so when you go to your Facebook, you go to settings, and then you click on ads. And then, uh, there’s a section called “your information,” and under that you can click “your categories.”","PJ: Your categories.","ALEX: “Close friends of men with a birthday in seven to 30 days.”","PJ: So that's like a reason somebody... That's a category where you're buying perfume for other people. Who are they trying to hint that I need to buy a birthday present for?","ALEX: “Away from family. Gmail user. Millennial.”","PJ: “Housemate-based households: People living in households where one or more people are not immediate members of family. Away from hometown. Frequent traveler.” I don’t know, it’s weird.","ALEX: It is weird. And this is not a complete picture of the information that they have on you. Facebook knows so much more, but they just keep a lot of it secret. And honestly, we only get a real glimpse of how much they know when they screw up. For instance, I talked to Charles Duhigg, he used to work at the New York Times, and he’s written a lot about how big companies track you. And he had this story about a friend of his who learned something really disturbing through Facebook.","So,his friend’s this liberal guy, lives on the East coast.","CHARLES: His brother-in-law lives in another different state, they don’t see him often, but his brother-in-law is kind of one of those, like he’s into guns, and he’s really conservative. But my friend, he wants to have a relationship with his brother-in-law. So like, he like friended him on Facebook and they’ll like cross post, and he always tries to, like, like the posts of his brother in law that aren’t, like, totally crazy.","ALEX: But then this really weird thing started to happen on Charles’ friend’s Facebook feed.","CHARLES: Which is that he saw- he started getting these like, these right-wing political ads that were like a little white supremacist. Like not really white supremacist, right? Because you can’t put white supremacist stuff on Facebook. But it was- it used a lot of the code words.","ALEX: Which freaked Charles’ friend out, because it’s not like he had ever expressed any interest in white supremacy or anything like that. So Thanksgiving rolls around, and he sees his brother-in-law, and he's like, \"Hey, um, I've been getting all of this sort of like stuff that feels disconcertingly, to me, like white nationalist or sort of, like racist. And you're probably like the only conservative that I friend online. I'm wondering if you have any idea what this might be happening.\" And he was like, \"Come outside. We need to talk.\"","PJ: What?","ALEX: And they go outside and he says listen, \"I disavowed this, I'm not into it anymore. But for a couple of months last year, I was going to a lot of like white pride, white nationalism meetups.\"","PJ: What?","ALEX: Yeah, so one of the things that Facebook can do is if you like something, it can advertise that thing to your friends. So the brother-in-law obviously signaled to Facebook that he was into white supremacy somehow, and Charles’ friend was liking a lot of the guy’s posts, and they were friends on Facebook, so Facebook was like, \"Alright, well, why don’t I advertise this white supremacist stuff to you.\"","PJ: Wow. That's wild. It’s like Facebook built a machine that just like as a side-effect outs white supremacists, but that’s not even like the point of the machine, like, they don’t care. Like, the whole point of it is just to like to learn things about you to sell you crap.","ALEX: Yeah but think about all of the stuff that this thing can do. Like if you look at everything that I just talked about, and you apply it to JP's perfume story, I think it explains it.","PJ: Oh, totally.","ALEX: So, like Debbie is going through the TSA in Oklahoma. She gets her perfume confiscated, and she's like, \"Aw, crap. Now I've gotta buy new perfume.\" She searches for it on her phone.","PJ: She like- she looks at it, she's like, \"Oh, it's kind of expensive, I'm not going to buy it right now.\"","ALEX: Right, but she goes to a page where Facebook has a, has a Pixel on it.","PJ: Facebook knows this person is now in the market to buy perfume. And-","ALEX: And it knows that-","PJ: -she's traveling.","ALEX: She's traveling-","PJ: Right. And they probably know that she’s traveling to visit her son because like he’s her son, he lives in San Francisco. She’s logging in in San Francisco, so is he.","ALEX: Right.","PJ: So why not show the son a perfume ad because he could be like, “Oh mom, isn't this the perfume you like?”","ALEX: Exactly.","[MUSIC]","[phone rings]ALEX: (clears throat)JP: Hi, this is John PaulALEX: Hey, this is Alex, how are you doing?JP: Hey, I’m great how are you?","So I called JP, and I told him that while I couldn't say with 100 percent certainty that Facebook wasn't listening to him, I had a lot of evidence that they just didn't need to.","ALEX: So then Facebook knows that she wants perfume, right?JP: Yeah.ALEX: Knowing your relationship, Facebook might have given your partner that ad because it knows that she’s nearby and it knows that she wants perfume.JP: Okay. (laughs) I mean… So maybe they’re not listening on the microphone, but- I don’t know. It just feels like they are. It’s just really, like, it-it-this is a weird thing we’ve signed up for and--and allowed. You know, thank you for the additional information. I- (stammers and laughs).ALEX: (laughs) Um–JP: Oh boy.","ALEX: So I actually kind of thought my work was kind of done here, and then a couple of days later, I got an email from JP with the subject line, “I’m not sure I’m convinced.”","PJ: (laughs)","ALEX: And he just told me another story, a story about talking about having a leg cramp, and then getting an ad on Instagram for cramp cream.","PJ: I actually don't find that surprising. Like, I feel like, I think you can learn as much as you want, I don’t think you're ever going to convince anybody who already believes that Facebook is spying on them that they're not. And I think it’s actually Facebook’s fault. Like, they’ve created this problem because they're really good at collecting information about us, they won't be very transparent about what they collect or how. And so, you're basically forcing people to come up with the simplest possible solution for how Facebook knows stuff about them, and that's that they're listening in.","I would be surprised if you could find literally one person in the world who thinks this is happening who you could tell them what you've learned, and they would be like, \"Yeah. You're right.\"","ALEX: I could find one person.","PJ: You cannot find one person. We can- we can literally open the phone lines, we can let people call in, you will not find a person.","ALEX: OK.","[MUSIC]","PJ: After the break, Alex takes some phone calls.","[MUSIC]","BREAK","PJ: Okay, so Alex.","ALEX: Yes?","PJ: So I tweeted out, and I just like, “Hey we’re going to take calls. If you believe this thing is true, call in.” Before we even open the phone lines, I just want you to know how screwed you are. (laughs) So like, let me just actually bring it up, hold on.","ALEX: I saw.","PJ: Like, like hundreds of people, I think. Like, everybody thinks this is true. Including like, including tech journalists who I respect a lot. Like it’s not just like a fringe belief. Like everybody thinks this is true. Literally like the VP of Facebook’s ad division jumped in and was like, “We’re not doing this!” And there were just like all these people being like, “You’re lying, you’re lying.”","Like, you are- I think you are walking into something that is maybe a little bigger than either of us realized. And I’m really excited to watch you walk into it.","ALEX: I still think I can do it.","PJ: Okay. let’s take a call. Let's open the phone lines.","ALEX: Sounds good.","[Skype noise]ALEX: Hello.MONIQUE: Hi.ALEX: Hi, who’s this?MONIQUE: Hi, this is Monique.ALEX: Hi Monique, this is Alex.PJ: And PJ.MONIQUE: Hi guysPJ: So what’s going on here is that we’re talking to people who believe that Facebook is listening in on them using their microphones. And Alex, who’s done a lot of research, and as far as I can tell believes it’s not happening, he'll try to give you an alternate explanationMONIQUE: Ok, so I have a very quick story, and this is so funny, I was just telling my friend about this last night. Um, so, a few months ago I was on the phone talking to my friend and she was talking about this device that she had bought, um, to help her open coconuts.PJ: WhatMONIQUE: It was this really weird thing and she was trying to explain--she was explaining this tool, but she couldn't remember the name. And we get off the phone, and then that was it. And maybe 15, 20 minutes later, I’m scrolling on Facebook and I see an ad for this device called the Coco-Jack.PJ: (laughs) The Coco-Jack?MONIQUE: I screenshot it. And was like “Is this what you were talking about?” And she was like “Yes.” And ever since then, I’ve been convinced that they’re onto me.ALEX: OK (clears throat).PJ: God, this is like watching a conductor warm up.ALEX: OK, is this person your friend on Facebook?MONIQUE: Yes.ALEX: Did she buy the Coco-Jack online?MONIQUE: I don’t know for sure, but I don’t think she did.PJ: I just watched a balloon deflate–ALEX: No! Not necessarily.PJ: OK.ALEX: Do you know where she bought it?MONIQUE: If I recall correctly, she was in Vegas at some, like um, weird little shop, like “as seen on TV” shop. And she picked it up there.ALEX: Do you think that she was, like, frustrated by all her coconuts beforehand, and so she Googled like, “How to open coconuts?\"MONIQUE: Perhaps. Maybe. But why would I be seeing it on my- like I saw it on my feed?ALEX: So Facebook has the ability to follow you around the internet as you browse. When you’re logged into Facebook, and you go to a shopping site, and you put something in your cart, and you decide not to buy it, the site will then transmit that information back to Facebook, saying, “Hey, this person’s really interested in the Coco Jack.” Right?MONIQUE: Uh huh.ALEX: So another thing that Facebook does is that it allows advertisers to advertise certain products to the friends of people who have either purchased or shown interest in that product. So your friend-MONIQUE: Huh.ALEX: -Being really into the Coco Jack, her favorite new device, might have left some kind of digital trail.MONIQUE: I think that it’s a possibility, um--the way it happened. It happened so quick. As soon as we were off the phone, not long after I saw it in my feed. So I was convinced, like, oh, they heard me talk about about a coconut opener, and now they’re trying to sell me one. That’s what it looked like.ALEX: I understand. And that sounds creepy.MONIQUE: Mhmm.ALEX: And I empathize with feeling creeped out by it. But given an alternate explanation that does not require Facebook to be clandestinely listening to you using your microphone, which one feels more likely to you?MONIQUE: (sighs) You know what? I’m still kind of convinced that they might be listening to me.ALEX: Aw, Monique! You’re killing me here!PJ: This is not happening for you today.","[MUSIC]","MIKE: A coworker of mine had, this is going to sound silly, but she had brought in a brand of cough drop that I had never heard of before. It was new. We were talking about how I'd never heard of this cough drop before, and I didn't Google it. I didn't get on my phone and look it up. And I'm scrolling through Instagram like, maybe an hour later. And all of a sudden, there's an ad for this cough drop.PJ: Alex Goldman, how do you explain that?ALEX: Are you friends on Facebook with this friend who suggested, who- who brought in the cough drops.MIKE: Yes.ALEX: OK.MIKE: But can I- can I add a caveat?ALEX: Sure.MIKE: I wasn't friends with them until after the cough drop incident.ALEX: Oh.PJ: (laughs) You're so screwed.ALEX: Oh boy.","[MUSIC]","JASON: We were talking about whether we prefer like a firm or a soft mattress. And a couple days later, I started getting served ads for a mattress company called Casper.ALEX: So, Casper may have decided that they have, like, not penetrated the market in your town of people who are about to graduate from college and are probably going to need a mattress when they move into their own apartments. It’s very possible they know how much money you make because theybuy information about you from data brokers. Facebook buys information.PJ: Sir, are you finding this convincing?JASON: It- it’s a decent explanation. It just, like this one sounds as like plausible as, my phone heard me have this conversation with my friend, and immediately after that conversation, I’m immediately being served this ad about mattresses.ALEX: What could I possibly do to tip the scale in this situation?JASON: Uh-I-(sighs).ALEX: (laughs)JASON: (laughs)","PJ: Ok, let’s try another person to see if you have any chance of-","ALEX: Oh I’m definitely- I’m definitely going to convince someone.","PJ: So you are now 0-4?","ALEX: I can’t remember. Three or four.","[MUSIC]","TOM: Sillicon Valley startup idea of a milkshake.. And then for the next week I saw ads for Soylent in my Facebook scroll.ALEX: And like what was the lag time between you mentioning it and seeing Soylent ads?TOM: So I was visiting some family in a different town, and I remember the next week when I came back. It was within a couple of days.ALEX: OK. Where were you visiting, and where do you live?TOM: So I live in Des Moines, Iowa.ALEX: OK.TOM: And I was visiting my wife's cousins in Kansas City.ALEX: OK. Both hotbeds of Soylent consumption. Do you have any friends who, um, consume Soylent?TOM: Um, I had a coworker who was trying it for a while.ALEX: Uh, around--TOM: But I don't think I'm friends with them on Facebook.ALEX: Do you have any friends who live in San Francisco?PJ: (laughing)TOM: Uh… No.ALEX: Can you (laughing)? PJ has to keep turning away from me because he's laughing too hard about my futile attempts to convince people that-PJ: I've never watched anyone do something so badly.ALEX: (laughs)PJ: It’s like watching someone in the Olympics just fall down (laughs).ALEX: (laughs)","[MUSIC]","PJ: I didn’t think this would go like perfectly, but I did not think it would go this catastrophically so fast (laughs).","ALEX: What am I supposed to do? The problem here, which is the same problem with reporting out this story, is that Facebook not only is like a black box that tends to not want to tell you about how their stuff works. It is done using so many complex algorithms, that they don't even know. If I was like, \"Hey tell me how this ad got served to this gentleman,” the people of Facebook would say like, \"I don't know the answer to that.\"","PJ: I feel like you're reverse convincing me.","ALEX: What, like now-","PJ: I feel like I'm starting to go to the other side now.","[MUSIC]","JULIA: Hi, uh, my name is Julia.ALEX: This is Alex. How are you doing?JULIA: I’m great. How are you?ALEX: I’m good. I’m going to try and convince you that Facebook is not listening to you. Is Facebook listening to you?JULIA: Oh. 1000 percent. Um, so I was at a friend's house a few weeks ago.ALEX: Mhmm.JULIA: We were talking about a guy that she went to high school with, and I went to college with. We did not look him up. We did not google him. We did not go on his Instagram or his Facebook.ALEX: OK.JULIA: And the next day, both of us got him as a recommended follow on Instagram.ALEX: Huh.JULIA: And this is like not somebody who I had interacted with online literally in any capacity for like a good many years. And it was both of us that got the recommended follow, and you don't get the recommended follows that often. So, it's definitely listening to me.ALEX: PJ’s- PJ is smirking at me because he thinks that I can't answer this.PJ: No, I'm just smiling because your face is covered in flop sweatALEX: And you're absolutely right that I can't answer this one.PJ: (laughs)JULIA: (laughs)ALEX: Because ad targeting and the “people you may know” data sets are totally separate. I don't- I haven't been researching this. I have no idea. I have- I can't answer this one.JULIA: I do it tells you though that the microphone is definitely listening.ALEX: Uh- I-JULIA: What it's being used for…ALEX: PJ can’t- PJ can't keep it together. He's losing his mind. He thinks this is so funny.PJ: (laughing) I just think it's funny because Alex had a lot of confidence (laughing harder, barely audible) he would have all the answers, and would be able to explain it to people.ALEX: (laughing) I'm sorry Julia, I can't answer this one. I going to have to let you go. Maybe they're listening to you, and suggesting friends based on that, but I haven't been paying attention to that.PJ: (laughing) Wait--wait--you're giving up instead.ALEX: (laughing) I'm sorry?JULIA: [Skype breaking up] You need to follow this. I do think it is like irrefutably the microphone is on.ALEX: OK.JULIA: I think this is fair.PJ: You're not even arguing, Alex!ALEX: Why would I argue? He's like, \"Why aren't you arguing? Why aren't you arguing?\" I don't know anything about how they decide who they should suggest to you as friends. They could be.JULIA: But don't you think this means that like the microphone is on, and is listening, and is recording information.ALEX: I have no idea.PJ: (laughing) Oh my god.ALEX: PJ can't take it. You need to pull yourself together. I've got to convince someone before the end of the day, and I'm definitely not going to do it with Julia.PJ: (laughing) Well, I think that your argument is that maybe the microphone is listening to you is not going to convince anybody that the microphone is not listening.ALEX: (laughing) It might. It might.PJ: Julia, thank you so much.","[MUSIC]","ALEX: So, I wasn't able to convince anybody, but whether you think Facebook is listening to you or not, we are going to put a bunch of information up on our website about how to prevent them from tracking you as much as they do.

Throughout the last year, every time bad news has broken, executives have downplayed its significance. Look at its public statements last year about how many people had seen Russian-bought election ads — first it was 10 million, then it was 126 million.","Top execs dodged Congress when it was asking questions about Russian interference. They are selling their shares at a record clip.","The actions of Facebook execs now recall how execs at Nokia and Blackberry reacted after the iPhone emerged. Their revenues kept growing for a couple years -- and they dismissed the threats. By the time users started leaving in droves, it was too late.","There's no outside attacker bringing Facebook down. It's a circular firing squad that stems from the company's fundamental business model of collecting data from users, and using that data to sell targeted ads. For years, users went along with the bargain. But after almost a year of constant negative publicity, their patience may be waning.","Facebook did not initially respond to questions or a request for comment from CNBC.","The drumbeat","For more than a year now, Facebook has been deflecting stories about how its platform was used during the 2016 presidential election.","Some of this activity — like Facebook embedding workers with the Trump campaign to tell them how to advertise more effectively — was perfectly legal, and in line with normal business practices. A lot of these tactics would probably have drawn no scrutiny if Donald Trump hadn't surprised everybody by winning an election that all the polls showed him losing.","Other activity was against Facebook's policies, or outright illegal. Most notably, a U.S. grand jury recently indicted 13 Russian nationals for conducting a disinformation campaign on American soil intended to further political divisions in the country and sway the election toward Trump. Their tactics included using Facebook groups to organize divisive political protests and buying targeted ads.","CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has remained aloof throughout the whole sequence of events.","He addresses some of these issues on personal Facebook posts, but seldom talks to the press about them. Last year, he spent most of the year doing photo ops with people around America, but did not show up when Congress asked questions about how the Russians used Facebook to influence the 2016 election.","This year, he announced his annual personal challenge would be fixing Facebook — in other words, doing his job as the CEO of a publicly traded company worth more than $500 billion. In past years, he's taught himself Mandarin and hunted his own food.","The spin","Over the weekend, Facebook gave a case study in how the company reacts inappropriately to negative news.","On Friday night, Facebook made a surprise announcement that the company had suspended a political analytics research firm, Cambridge Analytica. The firm was funded by large Republican donor Robert Mercer, and Trump's campaign used it to target ads on Facebook.","In its Friday post, Facebook claimed it had discovered new evidence that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted data about Facebook users passed to it by a Russian-American researcher, who had collected it through a personality quiz that 270,000 Facebook users took. The data included information like the cities where users lived and what they had \"liked\" on Facebook.","It was against Facebook's terms of use for the researcher to pass the data along. Cambridge Analytica had told Facebook it had deleted the data back in 2015, but Facebook said it had received recent reports to the contrary, according to the blog post.","(Cambridge Analytica has countered the allegations, saying it was in compliance with Facebook's guidelines, and that no data collected through the app was used in the Trump campaign.)","But as is often the case in political scandal, the problem isn't so much the original action, but the cover-up. Or in this case, the spin.","It turns out that Facebook didn't just spontaneously decide to ban the political research firm. It was actually trying to get ahead of two bombshell reports, in the New York Times and The Observer (the Sunday edition of U.K. paper The Guardian). The publications detailed exactly how Cambridge Analytica had collected information about Facebook users in a bid to target them with political messages.","Facebook knew about these news stories for some time. It also appears that the company was trying to squelch the reports.","The Times report claimed that, in private conversations with the newspaper, Facebook \"downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control.\" The Guardian wrote that \"Facebook's external lawyers warned the Observer it was making 'false and defamatory' allegations, and reserved Facebook's legal position.\"","The stories went ahead anyway. Once they were published, Facebook executives immediately took to Twitter to defend the company, insisting that this was not a \"breach.\"","In tweets that were later deleted, Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos called the stories \"important and powerful,\" while insisting that it was \"incorrect to call it a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\" The deleted tweets are preserved below:","So far, more than 24 hours after the stories, Zuckerberg and his number-two, COO Sheryl Sandberg, have not responded.","Missing the point","The Facebook executives who responded are correct — there was no security breach. Users gave their information willingly. Moreover, Facebook has since put better security controls for apps in place, so users can more easily control what information apps are gathering and how they're using it.","But they're missing the point.","Facebook users are slowly learning that almost anybody can use Facebook to collect detailed information about them, and that — at least some of the time — Facebook cannot control where this information flows, or how it is used. Using Facebook is like writing your life story down on a piece of paper, then taping it to a lamppost.","Journalists and privacy advocates may roll their eyes at this \"revelation\" — they've been warning people about Facebook and privacy since its inception.","Users mostly ignored these warnings. They wanted to share photos, connect with old friends, play games, take quizzes and watch videos, and Facebook gave them a simple way to do it. More than 2 billion people around the world now use the 14-year-old service, and Facebook sold nearly $40 billion worth of ads last year.","But things are beginning to change. There's a growing sense that Facebook has become creepy instead of fun.","A lot of people are noticing that the ads on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram are so precisely targeted, they're sure the company is eavesdropping on their conversations through their phone microphones. (Facebook swears it is not — CNBC's Michelle Castillo has a great explanation of what is probably going on.)","More to the point, people are starting to curb their Facebook usage. In the fourth quarter, for the first time ever, the number of people in North America who used Facebook every day dropped from the previous year.","Also, Zuckerberg told investors on the company's earnings call that the company saw a 5 percent drop in time spent on Facebook during the quarter. The company claimed that this reduced engagement was because of some technical changes that Facebook made to crack down on low-quality content and give users a more positive experience.","These are just two small metrics. Facebook is still growing in many regions and by many other measurements.","But still: Fewer people using Facebook every day in one region, and spending less time on it. That's never happened before.","For the time being, advertisers are grumbling about Facebook and warning their clients to stay away from certain ad products, but they're still putting their money there — with an audience over 2 billion and some of the most accurate ad targeting available, Facebook is still impossible to ignore.","But if usage continues to decline, advertisers will start eventually follow. And there are plenty of hungry smaller competitors — Twitter and Snap, particularly — who would be happy to take some of that money.","Executive stock sales not reassuring","Meanwhile, Facebook executives are not exactly sending a reassuring message to investors by unloading their shares at a rapid clip.","Last summer, after Zuckerberg's plan to create another class of stock to solidify his control of the company foundered, he announced he'd begin selling off up to 75 million shares (about 18 percent of his stake), worth nearly $13 billion, by mid-2019. The money will support the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), his other company devoted to good works.","Why now? Zuckerberg is 33 years old -- far from retirement. What exactly is CZI doing that requires such a massive investment? Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is building rocket ships to explore space with his other company Blue Origin, and he only needs to spend $1 billion a year.","Other top executives are also selling in massive amounts. Jan Koum, who founded the messaging app WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014 for $19 billion, sold $2.8 billion worth of shares last year — more than any exec at any major tech company. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sold $2 billion of stock last year, in part to fund Blue Origin. Nobody else is close.)","Sandberg sold over $300 million, which pales in comparison to her colleagues but is still unusually large among officers of top tech companies.","Facebook stock is up over 80 percent in the last 12 months. Perhaps these execs are just taking gains, as any normal employee with stock compensation would be advised to do.","But these are not normal employees. They're the leaders of the company.","Other leaders keep skin in the game during difficult times -- think of how Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer held on to most of his stock throughout his tenure, even as Microsoft faced expensive antitrust lawsuits and growing competitive threats, or how Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey bought shares in 2017 when many investors had written the company off.","Facebook is facing real problems. Instead of giving answers to those problems, top execs are selling, spinning and staying silent."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.

{"originalurl":"http://www.cyberinject.com/facebook-makes-its-privacy-data-downloading-and-deletion-settings-easier-to-find/","title":"Facebook makes its privacy, data downloading and deletion settings easier to find | CyberInject","text":["With Facebook facing a wave of public backlash over how it has handled user data over the years — a backlash that was kicked off two weeks ago with the revelation that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had worked on targeted election campaigns using personal and private Facebook data — the company today announced a new set of changes to help users find and change their privacy settings, as well as download and delete whatever data has been collected through Facebook’s network of social media services.","To be clear, many of these settings and features already existed in Facebook, but now Facebook is making them significantly clearer for the average user to find and use. It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The idea was that by providing a degree of security allied with freedom, people would be best placed to make better decisions about their own lives. UBI was never suggested as a panacea; rather it was proposed as a helping hand.","As the debate ignited over the past couple of years, as the idea moved from imagination to mainstream, even provoking a sense of regret in a US presidential candidate that the idea wasn’t embraced more readily, so the controversy and misinformation spread. Perhaps inevitably, too many advocates have over-claimed the benefits of UBI and the risks if it is not adopted. Too often, the argument has been preceded by scare stories of mass job-eating robots and UBI as a gateway to a post-work idyll. We accept neither of these overly gloomy or utopian visions.","But opponents have been all too willing to ignore the evidence of what UBI has been in practice – generally beneficial across the board in numerous trials – and too ready with reflexive caricature. For example, the latest economic research on Alaska, which has had a Basic Income style payment – albeit variable as a dividend – in place for over 35 years shows that unconditional, universal cash payments do not reduce employment at all whilst other research has shown they do increase well-being on a whole series of measures. The intensity of the interest wasn’t something we anticipated and it has been a double-edged sword. But time and time again we have returned to our original argument: a carefully implemented UBI would support good work – in the widest sense of the word – rather than usher in a post-work future.","Good and careful implementation is key. That is why we support trials, even when they are not pure ideal type UBI trials, in Finland and Canada. And the decision of the Scottish Government to scope trials is also to be strongly commended. The more understanding of UBI in practice we have, the better. So other trials in Stockton and Oakland in California are welcome too. We hope that, faced with mounting evidence of complete system failure in the UK benefits system, the UK Government will also support trials of alternative approaches involving UBI across the UK.","To secure public support, UBI will have to be developed carefully and in line with many prevailing norms. One of these norms is that people should make a positive contribution to society wherever they can. The argument to be had is with the notion that the hard conditionality of the current system is anything other than counter-productive in service of this expectation. We do not think any job will do and, indeed, that attitude has led to much harm alongside good with an economic price to pay through lack of appropriate skills matching and an absence of mobility for those who are most insecure. Far from an engine of mobility, conditionality creates human misery, insecurity, and locks people in sub-par work or poverty far too much. High employment is necessary but insufficient in combating economic insecurity. A stronger social contract is needed.","Our discussion paper published today is intended to widen the lens on UBI and economic insecurity rather than advocate an intractable position. We accept – as has always been our motivation – that UBI must be designed as a pro-good work institution. And we have always argued that UBI is part of a nexus of interventions including support for lifelong learning, support into work, caring (including childcare), support for workers from unions and professional associations, a genuine commitment to good work and investment in people from more employers, and the right legal framework underpinning good work.","At the core of today’s paper is an idea that we hope anyone interested in the future of work and well-being will engage with. In order to help provide greater security as people need to navigate economic, technological and care challenges in the 2020s, the idea is to provide up to two years of a £5,000 payment for each family member. This will enable people to re-train, try a new business idea, assume caring responsibilities, and perhaps try a new career. It gives people a helping hand to adapt to change; something we don’t believe the current social contract does adequately.","Our primary concern is economic insecurity. In Addressing Economic Security, Atif Shafique offered a new way to think about insecurity: defining it as both an economic and psychological state influenced by a range of interrelated factors beyond merely employment status. This approach questions a notion that has underpinned public policy for quarter of a century, namely that there is a cast-iron equation between having a job and economic security. And Brhmie Balaram and Fabian Wallace-Stephens, in Thriving, Striving, or Just About Surviving?, showed that 30 percent of workers face chronic or acute precariousness with a further 40 percent facing uncertain futures.Access to £5,000 per annum per family member for two years could be just the support that makes a risk manageable or an opportunity worth taking. Think of it as a student grant for basic rate taxpayers and their families.","To fund the ‘Universal Basic Opportunity Fund’ (UBOF), the Government would finance an endowment to cover the fund for 14 years from a public debt issue (at current low interest rates). This endowment would be invested to both fund asset growth and public benefit. The fund could be invested in housing, transport, energy and digital infrastructure and invested for high growth in global assets such as equity and real estate. This seems radical but actually, similar mechanisms have been established in Norway, Singapore and Alaska. In the latter case, Basic Income style dividends are paid to all Alaskans. Essentially, the UBOF is a low-interest mortgage to invest in infrastructure and human growth that brings forward the benefits of a sovereign wealth fund to the present rather than waiting for it to accumulate over time.","These investments would provide returns to support the £5,000 payments to citizens and could be supported by a range of redistributive mechanisms such as corporate levies, high net wealth taxes, equity transfers from leading companies, and we have even suggested exploring a charge on UK data assets that are transferred to global platforms. The maximum cost of the Basic Opportunity Dividend as we have modelled it is £14billion per year. By way of comparison, corporate tax reductions since 2010 are expected to cost the Exchequer £16billion per year by 2020. And the fund will both support physical infrastructure and, if they match the return achieved by Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, would cover half of the cost of the Basic Opportunity Dividend. The following illustrates how this works:","The advantages of this approach are that it is redistributive, it is something that could be done now, it doesn’t lean heavily on income tax, and provides a framing for UBI that is definitively pro-opportunity, pro-contribution and pro-good work. And it’s a large scale Basic Income experiment before full adoption. The economic impacts – and there could be a significant uplift in productivity as people invest in their futures and find the best use for their skills – and social consequences, positive or negative, can be tracked including during an initial four year period when the fund would be available to 25 per cent of the population.","The design principles and funding mechanisms we lay out could allow citizens to make major changes to their lives which they would otherwise be constrained from doing. A low-skilled worker might reduce their working hours to attain skills enabling career progression. The fund could provide the impetus to turn an entrepreneurial idea into a reality. It could be the support that enables a carer to be there for a loved one without the need to account for one’s caring to the state.","UBOF could be the first step towards a new model of social security which puts faith in people to make decisions pertaining to the aspirations that they have for their lives. It represents an investment in human potential; measured not just in GDP or productivity growth but in security, opportunity, creativity, fulfilment and wellbeing also. As a practical means of advancing the UK towards a Universal Basic Income system, the UBOF could represent a stepping stone – to be enacted now – towards a better way of enabling citizens to live meaningful and contributory lives.","You might also like","In advance of a national conference on the future of work, Sir Brendan Barber, Acas Chair, argues that anyone who aims to influence the world of work has to understand the ever- shifting policy focus between regulation, in ...","11\nComments","Join the discussion","Whilst not directly related to UBI, the options for raising more funds are important. Ideally UBI would be net neutral to the public purse; increasing opportunity and individual economic activity feeding back into the taxation that funded your UBI grant etc. However the need to raise additional public income does need addressing. One of the options which often dismays me is the taxing of net assets. This is rarely explained and oftener ignores liquidity whilst misinterpreting wealth. We need to see wealth (at least financial wealth which is only a narrow definition) as the the ability to but more with what we have. I say this because high personal property values are often confuse with wealth. House prices escalate but having a high priced house doesn't give you either liquidity or net wealth. Typically, if you sell you house the proceeds only give you enough to buy a similar house, not to get a bigger one therefore an increased house value does not represent more wealth. Furthermore, taxing net assets (in this example the market value of your house) takes no account of liquidity and will essentially force people out of their homes into lower value properties in order r to pay the net asset tax. So, whilst the idea fo taxing net assets has some value, it needs to be very carefully framed to ensure that it is the net liquid wealth that is taxed not the capital value of something whose value has not increased in comparison to similar assets.","The report mixes two different but important aspects; the case for UBI and how to find it. For the case for UBI is strong and should create opportunity allowing people to re-train or deal with life challenges with some degree of economic security. It is also interesting to limit it in the first instance to a couple of 'grants' (didn't we used to such an idea .. called student grants!)However I am not convinced by the Fund idea. Setting up a new investment fund will cost a lot in fees and administration and will only succeed as much as assets values increase and the ability to liquidate them is possible. The value of UBI is to society and the public purse , so why not take it our of general taxation and save the fund management fees? (further simplifying the tauten system to take cost out would be beneficial, I doubt people want more taxes but Ian sure they would like better information on how their taxes are spent).","Catherine Raines","1st March 2018","I’m new to this topic and found this article interesting. I’m keen to understand what arguments underpin the amount of money suggested: why £5,000 pa? Why not £10,000 or £2,000? Has there been some thinking that suggests that £5,000 will be the optimum level? Thanks! Catherine Raines","An utterly absurd idea. There is no mention of conditionality so the 'free money' could be used in any way from betting shops onwards. Why is it considered an advantage that the scheme would be redistributive?","Making funds available for retraining is sensible but there are such schemes already. No doubt those who hope to receive the 'free money' will advocate the scheme but those who will have to pay will think otherwise.","I fear that this kind of publication will bring the Society into ridicule."],"isopubdate":""}

(Image: Sinclair Broadcast Group)","WASHINGTON (SBG) —","A number of Facebook users are changing their status with the social media giant from \"It's Complicated\" to \"Separated\" after learning the company mishandled user data and shared it with third-party developers.","For any public company, trust is its currency. The latest revelations of a massive user privacy breach at Facebook have raised new questions about whether the company can and should be trusted to responsibly manage the personal data of its more than 2.1 billion users.","#DeleteFacebook began trending last week after reports that Facebook allowed the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access the personal data of as many as 50 million users. According to admissions by Cambridge Analytica, the data was used to develop psychographic profiles to help political campaigns target voters.","In the aftermath of these revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a charm offensive, speaking with reporters, apologizing for mishandling user data and promising to do better in the future.","On Sunday, Zuckerberg took out a full-page ad in multiple U.S. newspapers that read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't we don't deserve it.\"","The ad referred to the Cambridge Analytica operation and the actions of a \"university researcher,\" Aleksandr Kogan, who developed a quiz app in 2014 on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Under Facebook's policy at the time, Kogan was able to pay for a feature called \"friends permission.\" That allowed him to harvest the data of 270,000 quiz-takers, who gave explicit consent to use their data, as well as the data that could be gleaned from their friend networks.","In his ad, Zuckerberg admitted that Kogan's app was not the only one that trawled large amounts of user information. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" Zuckerberg said. He concluded, \"Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\"","Some have taken note of the CEO's apology and applauded the company for taking steps to make its data-sharing policies more transparent. Zuckerberg and other executives at Facebook have published notices explaining steps they're taking to crack down on platform abuses as well as their efforts to make privacy settings more user-friendly.","Others have pointed to the fact that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user data.","\"Facebook says we don't sell your data, but they certainly provide access to it,\" observed Michelle De Mooy, director of the privacy and data project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.","Moreover, Facebook acknowledged that it knew about Cambridge Analytica's questionable contract with Kogan in 2015. At that time, they suspended Kogan and asked him to confirm that he had deleted the user data. According to reports, that user data remained accessible to Cambridge Analytica for years.","\"Facebook has been dragged, seemingly kicking and screaming into being more transparent,\" said Dave Levine, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \"Facebook has not done nearly as much as it could, simply by way of explanation to the public about its behaviors, about how your information or posts are curated, about what kind of data it collects and how it shares it.\"","The Cambridge Analytica breach is only the latest example of the company's opacity and delayed response to public outcry. Facebook has been at the center of the fake news controversy and spreading misinformation during the 2016 election. The company has been called before Congress over their role in facilitating Russian election interference and online terrorist recruitment. And the company finally acknowledged and changed their newsfeed policy after being caught suppressing conservative content.","Each scandal has temporarily hurt Facebook, but the latest scandal over violating users' privacy could be the one that tips the scales and imposes real costs and consequences on the social media giant.","\"Ultimately the problem here is one of trust,\" explained Julian Sanchez, privacy and technology fellow at the Cato Institute. If users no longer believe the company is responsibly handling their information or feel they cannot understand the company's policies for sharing their data, Zuckerberg's apologies will be \"too little, too late,\" Sanchez noted.","\"Once that's burned, once people don't have a sense of trust, I don't know if the specific policy changes will help much,\" he continued. \"Even if they really are making genuine improvements, as it appears they are, once that trust is gone, it's hard to get back.\"","In a new poll conducted in the days after the data sharing scandal erupted, Reuters/Ipsos found that the majority of respondents do not trust Facebook to handle their data.","Facebook was deemed the least trustworthy when it came to obeying laws that protect American's personal information when compared to other companies that gather user data like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo.","\"Maybe the poll is new, but the sentiment is not,\" De Mooy explained. The reason, she said, is that social media platforms \"are designed for opacity,\" intentionally making it harder for users to understand and make informed decisions about their data.","Facebook and other companies that rely on selling access to user data have had to walk a thin line between protecting their users' data and monetizing it. Consistently over recent years, polls have shown that even as users sign up and sign away some of the rights to their data, they are wary of how that information is being used.","Periodically, this concern has translated into relatively short-lived calls for people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, but it is not clear that those efforts have caused the company to fundamentally change how it operates.","\"If a few hundred-thousand people delete their Facebook accounts that will have a marginal impact on their bottom line,\" Levine noted. \"However if there is a reputational hit at the trust level, which is what Facebook needs to maintain in order to be a viable business, that cumulatively could create problems.\"","In recent weeks, Facebook has taken a significant hit with the markets valuing the breach of privacy and trust in the tens of billions. Since the story broke earlier this month, Facebook's stock has plunged more than 15 percent in a selling spree that has cost the company over $75 billion in market value.","Facebook could also be facing even more costs as the consumer protection watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy and data use policies based on the reports about the company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","The FTC already brought charges against Facebook in 2011 for what it termed \"deceptive privacy claims.\" At the time, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC and signed a consent decree which, among other things, required the company to obtain a user's explicit consent before allowing third parties to access their data. Moreover, the agreement required Facebook to inform users if they discovered they were unable to protect their data.","\"Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here,\" former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Jessica Rich told the Washington Post last week. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties.\"","If the FTC finds Facebook in violation of the consent decree, the company could face a $40,000 fine per violation. It is not clear whether that fine would apply to the alleged 50 million users whose data was shared inappropriately with Cambridge Analytica. In a statement to the Post, a Facebook spokesperson said the company rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","De Mooy said she is encouraged by the FTC investigation, emphasizing that \"the consent decrees need to be meaningful.\" However, she worries that regulators simply lack the enforcement authority when it comes to protecting consumer data.","In the United States, consumer data is largely governed by contracts and terms of use agreements between the consumer and the company. This approach is vastly different from the European Union, which will be implementing a new regime of privacy protections, the General Data Protection Regulation, beginning in May.","The new privacy regime will directly impact U.S. tech companies that will be required to be more transparent in informing consumers about their sharing practices in order to get consent. Companies that fail to protect user data can also expect to see millions of dollars in fines.","It is yet to be seen whether U.S. lawmakers, who have traditionally taken a lax approach to regulating internet companies, will take steps to strengthen data privacy protections."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

But in post-truth, the person believes that objective truth exists, but they subordinate truth to their preferences, or their comfort. In other words, one doesn’t care that truth exists or what the truth is if it doesn’t line up with one’s preferences. \"There is but one straight course, and that is to seek truth and pursue it steadily\" – George Washington letter to Edmund Randolph — 1795. Faith in Jesus Christ is our response to God's elective purpose in our life. These two truths–God's initiative and man's response–co-exist throughout the Bible. The gospel is \"the message of truth\" because truth is its predominant characteristic. Salvation was conceived by the God of truth (Ps. 31:5); purchased by the Son, who is the truth (John 14:6); and is applied by the Spirit of truth (John 16:13). To know it is to know the truth that sets men free (John 8:32). Believers are people of the truth (John 18:37), who worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4:24), and who obey the Word of truth (John 17:17). People have rejected, neglected, redefined, and opposed God’s truth for centuries. Some cynically deny that truth even exists or that it can be known by men (John 18:38). Others foolishly think that denying truth will somehow make it go away. Truth determines the validity of one's belief. Believing a lie doesn't make it true. Conversely, failing to believe the truth doesn't make it a lie. The gospel is true because Jesus is true, not simply because Christians believe in Him. His resurrection proved the truth of His claims and constitutes the objective basis of our faith (Rom. 1:4; 1 Pet. 1:3). Truth is our protection and strength (Eph. 6:14). Throughout history, people have tried everything imaginable to gain favor with God. Most turn to religion, but religion apart from Christ is merely a satanic counterfeit of the truth. At the heart of every false religion is the notion that man can come to God by any means he chooses–by meditating, doing good deeds, and so on. But Scripture says, \"There is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved\" (Acts 4:12). That name is Jesus Christ, and we come to Him by confessing and repenting of our sin, trusting in His atoning death on the cross, and affirming His bodily resurrection from the grave (cf. Rom. 10:9-10). There is no other way to God. False religious leaders and teachers talk much about God’s love, but not His wrath and holiness; much about how deprived of good things people are, but not about their depravity; much about God’s universal fatherhood toward everyone, but not much about his unique fatherhood toward all who believe in His Son; much about what God wants to give to us, but nothing about the necessity of obedience to Him; much about health and happiness, but nothing about holiness and sacrifice. Their message is full of gaps, the greatest of which leaves out a biblical worldview of the saving gospel and replaces it with the worldview of postmodernism with its dominant ethical system of relativism. The Bible describes mankind in the end times: “always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth” (2 Tim. 3:7). Spiritual answers cannot be deduced by human reason alone (1 Cor. 2:14). It’s not that spiritual truth is irrational or illogical, but that human wisdom is defective, because it’s tainted by man’s sinfulness, and unable to perceive the things of God. That is why the Bible is so important. It gives us the answers we can’t find on our own. It is God’s Word to mankind. Scripture is divinely revealed truth that fills the vacuum of spiritual ignorance in all of us. Post-truth is the word of the year for 2016 and also the philosophy of the day, According to the dictionary, “post-truth” means, “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” Simply put, we now live in a culture that seems to value experience and emotion more than truth. In a “post-truth” world, people make choices based on emotion and experience rather than objective fact. So in a post-truth world, truth is irrelevant. What exactly is a post-truth culture? It’s a culture where truth is no longer an objective reality. It has become subjective. It’s what’s true for me—my beliefs, my opinions, determine my truth. So in our post-truth culture, man determines truth. Man makes himself the ultimate authority. This starting point, which rejects God’s Word and the idea of moral absolutes, makes truth subjective. Truth will never go away no matter how hard one might wish. Christianity is grounded in objective truth. “And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32). Objective truth exists because we have God’s Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus says, “Sanctify them by Your truth. Thy word is truth” (John 17:17), and Paul and James describe the Bible as “the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15; James 1:18). The Psalmist says, “The entirety of your word is truth” (Psalm 119:160). Jesus Himself said, “For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice” (John 18:37). When Jesus said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except by me” (John 14:6), He wasn’t expressing His personal belief or opinion. He was speaking the truth, a fundamental reality that doesn’t change from person to person. It doesn’t matter if our culture thinks all roads lead to God. The truth of the matter is “no one comes to the Father but by [Jesus].” This blogs goal is to, in some small way, put a plug in the broken dam of truth and save as many as possible from the consequences—temporal and eternal. \"The further a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\" – George Orwell","How to find the little-known ‘kill switch’ that lets you use Facebook with the maximum amount of privacy (FB)","There’s a Facebook setting that acts as a “kill switch” to keep apps and other websites from sharing or accessing your information.","It’s called “Platform.” And you can turn it off.","With Platform “off” you can make your Facebook as private as possible without deleting the account altogether.","Here are the instructions.","There’s a Facebook setting that acts as a “kill switch” to keep apps and other websites from sharing or accessing your information.

These numbers represent the ticks of the clock and the growth in Facebook’s revenue since we first called out the “social network” for its harmful data practices in the pages of The Wall Street Journal. In the (eventful) years since, we’ve seen an evolution: Influential voices that initially challenged our premise have joined the collective outcry against the “duopoly”—Google and Facebook. The two companies are finally losing some of their grip over academia, think tanks, and Washington.","However, while industry insiders and major media companies have started to see through the shiny “we’re-a-free-service” veneer of these tech giants, consumer awareness and regulatory threats are just beginning to catch up.","Sentiment is certainly shifting. In an inspiring move shortly before the holiday break, Germany’s Federal Cartel Office published preliminary findings that Facebook has abused its dominance to collect internet users’ browsing history and personal data. It’s hard for a move like this to break into the current, insane U.S. press cycle. But make no mistake: This is significant. I would expect that few developments received more attention at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters last quarter including their lawyers’ summoning to our nation’s capital.","On one hand, Germany’s top antitrust enforcer’s move is a harbinger of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which the EU will begin to enforce on May 25, 2018. This new regulation, coupled with an expansive and updated set of privacy laws, will force Facebook and Google to obtain specific, unambiguous (and likely unachievable) consent for some of the ubiquitous data collection practices that they are uniquely able to impose on the public.","This means that Google and Facebook will no longer be able to default to requiring consumers to allow nearly web-wide monitoring and selling of their personal activities as a condition of using Gmail or their social network. In fact, Google already stopped doing this in Gmail last summer as it was likely the most prominent, yet indefensible, practice it would need to defend in the court of public opinion.","The rise of Facebook and Google has literally flipped competition law on its head. In the U.S. over the past 40 years, the first (and most-often last) judgement of fair competition has been consumer welfare, the measure of which was mostly pinned to whether a company’s dominance can drive up consumer prices. Times have changed, and the high cost to consumers can’t just be measured in dollars. Now, consumer costs are also measured in harm to competitive offerings and innovation.","Importantly, it’s also the first time we’ve seen a major regulator truly connect the dots between competition and data policy. The Google “suite”—as well as Facebook’s App, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and a plethora of other “social” products—share some common traits that should shake up competition regulation:","All of these products are free to consumers. If competition is judged simply based on consumer pricing trends, Google and Facebook can dismiss the conversation before it even begins. I can now keep up with my relatives in Asia for free thanks to Facebook while Google has given me one-click access to virtually everything on the internet. What’s not to love?","All of these products collect real-time data. Google tracks your web usage on nearly 80 percent of the top 1 million websites according to Princeton research. As we posited in our original WSJcolumn, Facebook’s ubiquitous Like buttons spread across the web pass your browsing history back to Facebook—even when they’re not clicked. This occurs completely outside of consumer knowledge, let alone what they would expect. The publisher and consumer expectations for these Like buttons were simply to allow users to signal stories they “liked.” This shady practice identified by DCN in 2014 is the source of the recent German findings.","Google and Facebook use this data collection to help micro-target advertising to users across the web. Advertising is 98 percent and 87 percent of Facebook and Google’s respective revenues. Both companies have significant troves of organic data from the use of their sites and products to target this advertising. But they are also able to grow with the entire internet by leveraging web-wide data in real time. In the digital world, big data requires scale, and it loses value quickly as it becomes stale. It’s the web-wide data collection that is the most troubling and outside consumer expectations; and also provides their unique power and influence over the content, traffic, and monetization of the internet.","Underneath their moon shots and free services, the duopoloy’s core revenue stream is quite simply the targeted junk mail business of the ’90s reinvented and turbocharged for the 21st century. Google and Facebook clearly state in their SEC filings that their businesses are primarily funded by cost-effective, highly targeted advertising, and changes to data ownership policies are a significant risk to this business.","So, we find ourselves at a place in which one of the most suspect advertising models ever devised underpins the vast wealth and unnerving data collection and manipulation of some of the most powerful companies on earth. The dubious ethics that drive these businesses have wide-ranging impact on the tech community—venture capitalists and startups all racing to build a comparable scale of automated consumer surveillance.","Perhaps more importantly, the rise of the duopoly presents profound challenges for our society as democracies struggle to defend against nation-state attacks made possible by platforms overly reliant on algorithms, as citizens increasingly seclude themselves in news bubbles, as quality journalism becomes harder to fund and as individuals lose private spaces to ask questions, converse, and interact. Regardless of political stripe, we all need to be asking hard questions about what kind of society we want to leave for the next generation."],"isopubdate":"2018-01-09"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-noisy-fallacies-of-psychographic-targeting/","title":"The Noisy Fallacies of Cambridge Analytica and Psychographic Targeting | WIRED","text":["The Noisy Fallacies of Psychographic Targeting","At this point in the deafening media cycle around the story, it’s probably unnecessary to summarize the going Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal, but briefly and just in case: Facebook recently announced the suspension of a marketing data company called Cambridge Analytica from its platform after a whistleblower confirmed it had misused ill-gotten Facebook data to construct so-called “psychographic” models and help Trump win the presidency.","For the impatient, my fundamental thesis is this: Cambridge Analytica’s data theft and targeting efforts probably didn’t even work, but Facebook should be embarrassed anyhow.","For the more patient: What on earth is the sinister-sound “psychographics” about, and how is your Facebook data involved?","Antonio García Martínez (@antoniogm) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED. Before turning to writing, he dropped out of a doctoral program in physics to work on Goldman Sachs’ credit trading desk, then joined the Silicon Valley startup world, where he founded his own startup (acquired by Twitter in 2011), and finally joined Facebook’s early monetization team, where he headed its targeting efforts. His 2016 memoir, Chaos Monkeys, was a New York Times best seller and NPR Best Book of the Year, and his writing has appeared in Vanity Fair, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. He splits his time between a sailboat on the SF Bay and a yurt in Washington’s San Juan Islands.","The awkward portmanteau coinage of “psychographics” is meant to be a riff on the “demographics” (i.e. age, gender, geography), which are the usual parameters of how marketers talk about advertising audiences. The difference here is that the marketer attempts to capture some essential psychological state, or some particular combination of values and lifestyle, that imply a proclivity for the product in question. If it sounds nebulous, not to say somewhat astrological, it is. As a great example of the type of cartoonish zodiac that emerges from this approach, take the age-old classic, the Claritas PRIZM segments (now owned and marketed by Nielsen), which have been around since the 90s. One sample segment:","Kids & Cul-de-Sacs: Upscale, suburban, married couples with children - that's the skinny on Kids & Cul-de-Sacs, an enviable lifestyle of large families in recently built subdivisions. […] Their nexus of education, affluence and children translates into large outlays for child-centered products and services.","This sort of caricature of a consumer segment was created as much for potential targeting as for populating ad agency pitches to clients. It took a complex and bewildering world of consumer data and preferences and reduced them to a neat mythology of just-so stories that got ad budgets approved. (“Aspirational Annie wants a starter car!” “Gregarious Greg spends over $400 per month on entertainment!”)","With the rise of programmatic, software-driven advertising in the late aughts, these truthy marketing fairy tales have taken a more quantitative tinge. Which, in the context of Facebook and Cambridge Analytics, is where the psychometricians at Cambridge University come in. Two researchers at the Department of Psychology there, Michal Kosinksi and David Stillwell, had endeavored to craft completely algorithmic approaches to human psychological evaluation. Those efforts included a popular 2007 Facebook app called myPersonality that allowed Facebook users to take a psychometric test and see themselves ranked against the ‘Big Five’ personality traits of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (often shortened to OCEAN). According to the report in The Guardian,which first ran the whistleblower’s claims, Cambridge Analytica had approached the authors of the myPersonality app for help with its ads targeting campaign. On being rebuffed, another researcher associated with Cambridge’s psychology faculty, Aleksandr Kogan, offered to step in and reproduce the model.","(Interestingly, you can still take some of their psychometric personality tests here. Don’t worry! No Facebook login required!)","Academic research centers with experimental volunteers and small sample sizes are one thing, but how do you do the study psychographics at Facebook scale? With an app, of course. Kogan wrote a Facebook app that asked Facebook users to walk through their computer-driven rating criteria with the specific view of ranking their ‘OCEAN’ characteristics, plus political inclinations.","Here is where the skullduggery comes in: Let’s assume you build a model that can actually predict a voter’s likelihood of voting for Trump or Brexit based on some set of polled psychological traits. For it to be more than a research paper, you need to somehow exploit the model for actual ads targeting. But the problem is that Facebook doesn’t actually give you the tools to target a psychological state of mind (not yet, anyway)—it only offers pieces of user data such as Likes. To effectively target an ad, Kogan would need to peg diffuse characteristics like neuroticism and openness to a series of probable Facebook Likes, and for Cambridge Analytics, he had to do it at a large scale.","Whether Kogan’s subjects realized it or not when they opted-in to his Facebook app, they allowed him to read some of their Facebook profile data. And for his collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan then hoovered in those users’ data, plus their friends’ data as well. (Facebook’s platform rules allowed this until mid-2015). That’s how the number of compromised users got as high as a reported 50 million. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica didn’t lure that many test subjects. They simply paid for or attracted hundreds of thousands, and pulling data from their subjects’ friends got them something like a third of the US electorate.","With the Facebook police asleep, and data theft pulled off, what was Cambridge Analytica’s next step?","They had to train a predictive model that guessed what sorts of Likes or Facebook profile data their targeted political archetypes possessed. In other words, now that Cambridge had a test set of people likely to vote for Trump, and knowing their profile data, how do they turn around and create a set of profile data the Trump campaign can input to the Facebook targeting system to reach more people like them?","Note that the aspiring psychograficist (if that’s even a thing) is now making two predictive leaps to arrive at a voter target: guessing about individual political inclinations based on rather metaphysical properties like “conscientiousness;\" and predicting what sort of Facebook user behaviors are also common among people with that same psychological quality. It’s two noisy predictors chained together, which is why psychographics have never been used much for Facebook ads targeting, though people have tried.","While these conclusions are hard to make categorically even with the data in hand (and impossible to make without), a straw poll among my friends in the industry reveal near-unanimous skepticism about the effectiveness of psychographic targeting. One of the real macro stories about this election and Facebook’s involvement is how many of the direct-response advertising techniques (such as online retargeting) that are commonplace in commercial advertising are now making their way into political advertising. It seems the same products that can sell you soap and shoes can also sell you on a political candidate.","Conversely, if this psychographics business is so effective, why isn’t it commonly used by smart e-commerce players like Amazon, or anyone else beyond the brand advertisers who like keeping old marketing folklore alive?","One of the ironies of this most recent Facebook brouhaha is the differing reactions between the digital marketing professionals who’ve spent a career turning money into advertising pixels and a concerned public otherwise innocent to the realities of digital advertising. Most ad insiders express skepticism about Cambridge Analytica’s claims of having influenced the election, and stress the real-world difficulty of changing anyone’s mind about anything with mere Facebook ads, least of all deeply ingrained political views.","The public, with no small help from the media sniffing a great story, is ready to believe in the supernatural powers of a mostly unproven targeting strategy. What they don’t realize is what every ads practitioner, including no doubt Cambridge Analytica itself, knows subconsciously: in the ads world, just because a product doesn’t work doesn’t mean you can’t sell it. Before this most recent leak, and its subsquent ban on Facebook, Cambridge Analytica was quite happy to sell its purported skills, no matter how dubious they might really be."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information - including the names of users, their \"likes,\" friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work - including a former Cambridge Analytica employee - said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what \"like\" buttons they had hit.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook's concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump's digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook's public website.","Some critics said Facebook's actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Cambridge Analytica - which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president's former senior adviser Stephen Bannon - has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its \"psychometric profiles\" could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company's actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, D, said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data \"may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. \"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 EU referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook's processes for dealing with developers who broke the company's rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules - usually because of a story in the news - the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook \"relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,\" Parakilas said. \"During my 16 months at the company, I don't recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.\"","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","\"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook's actions on Saturday, including if they ran afoul of their 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of their agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry in to U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge's \"psychographic targeting\" techniques - including its use of Facebook data - with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of the Cambridge work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge's work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm's data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign's data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump's strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge's parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in \"soft power,\" or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia's influence in the region.","SCL's main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience's values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of \"persuadables,\" and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL's defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company's techniques is that it \"can be undertaken covertly.\"","\"Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government's role and/or third parties can be invisible,\" he wrote.","(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

It preceded a day of chaos inspired by big data use and abuse that has raged all weekend and promises to keep playing out as lawmakers pledge to launch investigations.","On Friday, after a week of questions from investigative reporters, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica and parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) from its platform. The suspensions came late in the game, news outlets are charging, given that Facebook has known about this for three years. Facebook, for its part, claims that the parties involved lied about having deleted harvested data years ago. At least one of the parties involved has shown evidence that points to Facebook having done very little to make sure the data was deleted.","The banishment was unveiled a day before the publishing of two investigatory reports – one from the New York Times, another from The Observer. The reports both detailed how Cambridge used personal information taken without authorization from more than 50 million Facebook users in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters in order to target them with personalized political ads.","Cambridge is owned by conservative Republican hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. It’s a voter-profiling company that was used by conservative investors during both the Trump and Brexit campaigns.","The NYT/Observer reports relied on interviews with six former employees and contractors plus a review of the firm’s emails and documents. One such source was whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge University professor Aleksandr Kogan to obtain the data. The Observer quoted Wylie:","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.","Cambridge did so, the newspapers reported, because it had a $15 million investment from Mercer burning a hole in its pocket. Cambridge wanted to woo Steve Bannon with a tool to identify American voters’ personalities and to influence behavior, but it first needed data to flesh out that tool. So it took Facebook users’ data without their permission, according to the newspapers.","They called it “one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history” – one that allowed Cambridge to “exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.”","Not surprisingly, Facebook immediately pushed back against the characterization of a massive data leak in an update to its initial announcement of the suspensions. It said that the data got out not through a leak but because some 270,000 Facebook users willingly signed up for a Facebook personality test called thisisyourdigitallife that billed itself as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","Kogan was the developer of thisisyourdigitallife. Facebook says that in 2015, it found out that Kogan had lied and violated Facebook’s Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge. Facebook says that Kogan also gave the data to Wylie. Wylie was an employee of Cambridge Analytica at the time of the alleged breach but went on to start his own firm, Euonia Technologies, in 2014.","Wylie has produced a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer that apparently contradicts testimony provided last month by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who both told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news that Cambridge didn’t have, nor use, private Facebook data.","The Observer reports that the dossier includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – most of which belong to registered US voters – that were harvested from Facebook. Facebook has suspended Wylie from its platform while it carries out its investigation.","With regards to Facebook’s assertion that it was lied to about data deletion, Wylie’s dossier implies that it didn’t break much of a sweat to ensure that the data, improperly shared with third parties as it was, had in fact been deleted. The dossier includes a letter from Facebook’s lawyers, dated August 2016, in which he was asked to destroy data collected by GSR: a company Kogan set up to harvest user profiles.","That’s all that Facebook apparently did about the leak, or breach, or whatever you want to call it. It sent a letter, the receipt of which was delayed since Wylie was traveling, didn’t pursue a response when he didn’t answer for weeks, and neglected to follow up with forensics to make sure the data was deleted from his computers and storage.","Wylie:","That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.","You might well question how 270,000 people signing up for a Facebook personality quiz blossomed into a potential data breach affecting 50 million users – nearly 25% of potential US voters.","As The Observer describes it, the app scraped not just test-takers’ private profile data, but also that of their friends. Facebook didn’t disallow such behavior from apps at the time, but such data harvesting was allowed only to improve user experience in the app, not to be sold or used for advertising.","Of the 50 million profiles scraped (only 270,000 of which belonged to users who’d granted permission), roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could (at least theoretically) match users to other records and build “psychographic” profiles.","The NYT published an email from Kogan to Wylie describing what traits could be predicted from those profiles: they include gender, age, political views, religion, job, “sensational interests” (a category that includes whether somebody’s into guns/shooting/martial arts/drugs/black magic/paganism/how credulous they are), and belief in star signs, among others.","Cambridge Analytica gained notoriety for what its own execs called “psychological warfare” in both the Trump and Brexit campaigns.","Not surprisingly, Facebook has a far different account of what went down. But one thing the social network and the investigative journalists all agree on is that Cambridge not only relied on users’ private Facebook data, but it’s looking like it still possesses “most or all of the trove,” according to the NYT.","From Facebook’s explanation of why it’s suspended SCL and Cambridge:","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.","This is a lot, but there’s far more. The revelations come just weeks after special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians for allegedly using Facebook to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica is currently under investigation on both sides of the pond: it’s a key focus in two inquiries in the UK, one from the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and one by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), into data analytics for political purposes. In the US, Mueller’s probe is also delving into how the analytics firm helped Donald Trump win the presidency.","And then of course there’s Russia and its part in the dissemination of fake news. It turns out that Kogan has previously unreported links to St. Petersburg State University and has accepted Russian grants for research. His Facebook license was only to collect data for research purposes, not to pass on to a commercial outfit like Cambridge, and thus was in violation of Facebook’s terms.","Kogan claims that everything he did was legal, according to the Observer, and that he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Democrat Senator Mark R. Warner, Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, who’s been proposing an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising similar to how it’s done in television, radio and print, put out a statement saying that the latest revelations are yet another sign that online ads are the Wild West:","This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency. This is another strong indication of the need for Congress to quickly pass the Honest Ads Act to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","Post navigation","About the author","Lisa has been writing about technology, careers, science and health since 1995.

Facebook decides to ban 2 or so companies out of the probably thousands of instances of data abuse, internally and externally. All this while FB employees are admitting internal bias and discrimination. How long before congress gets involved now?","And so the gifts just keep coming.

There are lies, damn lies and now there are lies spun especially for you using your personal data. Fabricated to appeal your deepest thoughts.

Facebook announced it was suspending the company late Friday, saying the measure was in response to the data firm improperly storing the user data of 270,000 people for years after promising to delete it. On Saturday, however, sources cited by The New York Times said the suspension went far beyond simple policy violations, with the data firm accused of stealing the personal information of at least 50 million Facebook users with the goal of influencing elections. The personal data was reportedly obtained under the guise of a personality-prediction app by Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan, who is accused of conspiring with Cambridge Analytica to unlawfully glean users' information and build psychological profiles. The data analysis company has faced increasing scrutiny in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe for its work with President Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Facebook has also come under fire for its role in allowing Russian ads to flourish during the election, and some questioned why the social media giant took so long to take action against Cambridge Analytica.

Cambridge Analytica, the data firm he worked with – which funded the project to turn tens of millions of Facebook profiles into a unique political weapon – also attracted interest from a key Russian firm with links to the Kremlin.","Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed “micro-targeting” individuals on social media during elections.","The revelations come at a time of intense US scrutiny of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, with 13 Russians criminally charged last month with interfering to help Donald Trump.","In Britain, concerns about Russian propaganda have been mounting, with the prime minister, Theresa May, recently attacking Russia for spreading fake news, accusing Moscow of attempts to “weaponise information” and influence polls.","Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, discussed with Cambridge Analytica the data company’s powerful social media marketing system, which was already being deployed for Republican Ted Cruz in the US presidential primaries and was later used to back Brexit and Trump.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, emailed colleagues after initial contacts to say that Lukoil wanted a clearer explanation of “how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business”.","“They understand behavioural micro-targeting in the context of elections (as per your excellent document/white paper) but they are failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers,” he wrote in an email seen by the Observer.","A slide presentation prepared for the Lukoil pitch focuses first on election disruption strategies used by Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, in Nigeria. They are presented under the heading “Election: Inoculation”, a military term used in “psychological operations” and disinformation campaigns. Other SCL documents show that the material shared with Lukoil included posters and videos apparently aimed at alarming or demoralising voters, including warnings of violence and fraud.","Discussion of services offered by Cambridge Analytica was apparently going right to the top of Lukoil, even though its retail operations in America are a very minor corner of the oil and gas giant’s empire. Asking for a detailed presentation of Cambridge Analyticas’s work in July 2014, Nix told his colleague the document would be “shared with the CEO of the business”.","The chief executive of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, is a former Soviet oil minister who has said the strategic aims of Lukoil are closely aligned with those of Russia. “I have only one task connected with politics, to help the country and the company. I’m not close to Mr Putin, but I treat him with great respect,” he told the New York Times.","Cambridge Analytica said an affiliate company had talked to Lukoil Turkey about a loyalty card scheme and proposed a pilot study with a small number of petrol stations there, but the project had not gone ahead. “[The talks] were about potential commercial work in Turkey and did not involve any discussion of political work,” a spokesman said. “Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate companies have not worked in Russia and have not worked for a Russian company or organisation.”","Last month Nix told MPs: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do no have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","That appears to contradict the company documents seen by the Observer, that list Russia as one of the countries where Cambridge Analytica and affiliate companies have clients.","Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who has come forward to talk to the Observer, said it was never entirely clear what the Russian firm hoped to get from the operation.","“Alexander Nix’s presentation didn’t make any sense to me,” said Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica soon after the initial meetings. “If this was a commercial deal, why were they so interested in our political targeting?”","Lukoil did not respond to requests for comments.","Kogan, a lecturer who worked with Cambridge Analytica on building up the database of US voters then at the heart of the company’s plans, said he had not had any connection to the Lukoil pitch.","But while he was helping turn Facebook profiles into a political tool he was also an associate professor at St Petersburg State University, taking Russian government grants to fund other research into social media. “Stress, health, and psychological wellbeing in social networks: cross-cultural investigation” was the title of one piece of research. Online posts showed Kogan lecturing in Russian. One talk was called: “New methods of communication as an effective political instrument”.","Cambridge University said academics are allowed to take on outside work but are expected to inform their head of institution, a rule Kogan had complied with. “We understand that Dr Kogan informed his head of department of discussions with St Petersburg University regarding a collaboration; it was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity,” a spokesman said.","Apart from that, Kogan appears to have largely kept the work private. Colleagues said they had not heard about the post in St Petersburg. “I am very surprised by that. No one knew,” one academic who asked not to be named told the Observer. Russia is not mentioned in a 10-page CV Kogan posted on a university website in 2015. The CV lists undergraduate prizes and grants of a few thousand dollars and links to dozens of media interviews.","One Cambridge Analytica employee mentioned Kogan’s Russian work in an email to Nix in March 2014 discussing a pitch to a Caribbean nation for a security contract, including “criminal psychographic profiling via intercepts”.","“We may want to either loop in or find out a bit more about the interesting work Alex Kogan has been doing for the Russians and see how/if it applies,” the colleague wrote.","Kogan told the Observer: “Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

Credit: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg","Since the Cambridge Analytica Facebook data scandal, the number one question I've been asked is, \"What Facebook data did they get?\" The second most popular question is, \"What did Cambridge Analytica do with it?\" Let's review:","What we've been told","According to Mark Zuckerberg, \"In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends' data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends' data.\" Later in the same post, Zuckerberg claims that the issue surfaced again in 2015 and Facebook took action (perhaps not enough action) to bring the offending company into compliance with Facebook policies.","Related Stories","What Facebook data did they get?","The full answer to this question will come out in the upcoming investigations and legal proceedings. But we can make a pretty good guess at what data Cambridge Analytica obtained by looking at the endpoints of Facebook's Graph API v1.0 (application programming interface) which launched April 21, 2010, and wasn't fully closed down until April 30, 2015.","Using Facebook's Graph API v1.0, developers had unfettered access to almost all of your public-facing profile data, including:","The heart of the scandal focuses on one of the API's permissions groups called \"Extended Profile Properties.\" These endpoints provided access to data about your friends that your friends may not have explicitly granted permission for Facebook to expose, specifically:","In another permissions group, the API exposed an endpoint called read_mailbox which, just as it sounds, allowed developers access to users' private messages.","Wow, that's a lot of data. What can you do with it?","With tens of millions of rich data profiles, you can apply the tools of data scientific research to turn the data into action. This usually follows a disciplined methodology that starts with transforming the data into usable cohorts and clusters, learning about the propensities of the different cohorts and clusters, and then predicting how they might react to messaging by using simulations (Will a $10 discount work better than a coupon for a 10 percent discount? Is this cohort likely to vote for X?). Optimization is another common use for data (Let's optimize our media buy to drive 5 percent higher conversions by doing X. Let's get more people to vote for X). None of this is new. None of this is news. This is how internet advertising works.","Wait. What?","As crazy as this may sound, all of the sensationalist craziness, the ~$50 billion of Facebook value wiped out by the scandal, and all the talk of espionage and intrigue are basically about the realization that your data is used to serve you highly relevant, hyper-targeted messages. Again: Not new. Not news.","If Cambridge Analytica didn't obtain this data set from Facebook, it could have simply purchased a bunch of data and used best practices mar-tech tools to accomplish its marketing goals. Not surprisingly, a fair number of digital marketers I've spoken to about this believe that Cambridge Analytica would have achieved better results by leveraging the platforms directly.","Why do I care about this?","The silver lining to the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal is the fact that you are becoming aware of what data you create, what is collected, and how it is used. This is a very good thing.","When Facebook urges you to configure your privacy settings, they are using the wrong words. The company should be advising you that you are actually configuring your \"Public Persona Settings\" or your \"Online Presence Settings\" or simply your \"Public Settings.\" Whom you share your stuff with and who gets to see it are practically meaningless in the context of this issue.","What you should be configuring is your \"Personal Data Sharing Permission Settings\" or \"API Endpoint Permissions.\" These settings would restrict the data that could be extracted while we are passively going about our business online.","Way too complicated!","No. It really isn't. As a society, we have to raise our level of data maturity. Clearly Facebook has grown faster than it has matured. Societally, we are all neophytes when it comes to data literacy and data governance.","If you want control of your data, it would be a great idea to understand what that means. \"They know everything about me,\" says someone scared out of their wits by sensationalist headlines. No. They don't. They have data that can be turned into action to enrich organizations smart enough to use it. Are you hurt by this? Could you be?","Right now, you get to use Facebook, Google, Gmail, Waze, and other \"free\" apps for the cost of your data. If you don't want to pay with your data, you are welcome to make other choices. But you should understand how your data is being used before making a blanket statement that your data should be 100 percent private and 100 percent protected. Data is a form of currency, and it is a valid way to pay for goods and services. Data can be (and is) transformed into cash by tech companies. But that does not diminish the value of the services they provide.","Just because you did not take the time to learn how you were paying for a tech service and you thought it was \"free\" doesn't mean it is actually free and, most importantly, that you would be willing to pay cash money for it.","So let's use this scandal as an opportunity to learn as much as we can about data so when we start the regulatory process, we do it in a responsible way.","Author's note: This is not a sponsored post.

You shouldn’t have to wade through complicated privacy settings in order to ensure that the companies with which you’ve entrusted your personal information are making reasonable, legal efforts to protect it. But Facebook has allowed third parties to violate user privacy on an unprecedented scale, and, while legislators and regulators scramble to understand the implications and put limits in place, users are left with the responsibility to make sure their profiles are properly configured.","Over the weekend, it became clear that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company, got access to more than 50 million Facebook users’ data in 2014. The data was overwhelmingly collected, shared, and stored without user consent. The scale of this violation of user privacy reflects how Facebook’s terms of service and API were structured at the time. Make no mistake: this was not a data breach. This was exactly how Facebook’s infrastructure was designed to work.","In addition to raising questions about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election, this news is a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks that users face when their personal information is captured, analyzed, indefinitely stored, and shared by a constellation of data brokers, marketers, and social media companies.","Tech companies can and should do more to protect users, including giving users far more control over what data is collected and how that data is used. That starts with meaningful transparency and allowing truly independent researchers—with no bottom line or corporate interest—access to work with, black-box test, and audit their systems. Finally, users need to be able to leave when a platform isn’t serving them — and take their data with them when they do.","Of course, you could choose to leave Facebook entirely, but for many that is not a viable solution, unfortunately. For now, if you’d like keep your data from going through Facebook’s API, you can take control of your privacy settings. Keep in mind that this disables ALL platform apps (like Farmville, Twitter, or Instagram) and you will not be able to log into sites using your Facebook login.","If disabling platform entirely is too much, there is another setting that can help: limiting the personal information accessible by apps that others use. By default, other people who can see your info can bring it with them when they use apps, and your info becomes available to those apps. You can limit this as follows.","From the same page, click “Edit” under “Apps Others Use.” Then uncheck the types of information that you don’t want others’ apps to be able to access.

So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","(Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”)","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it.","\"All kinds of people had access to the data,\" said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica's methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. \"It was everywhere.\"","Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain's withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said.","Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost.","The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013.

A two-year long PR crisis has come to a head, and Facebook is facing some serious backlash. So the question is, how can Facebook win back the hearts -- and more importantly the trust -- of millions?","As it stands right now, Facebook staunchly believes itself to be a platform -- but what it really needs to be is a brand. Brands fight for our business, and they do so by fighting for our attention. And as a result, brands have personality. Brands make us love them. And that’s the action Zuckerberg needs to take.","Think about the companies we all love: Apple, Amazon, Tesla. These brands have purpose, they have meaning -- they have created relationships with their consumers. And that relationship is what keeps the public loyal, even in the face of a communications hiccup. (And yes, we are all aware that playing a questionable role in a major election is more than a hiccup … but still.)","Apple is an omnipresent brand, but it is by no means a perfect brand. It's publicly confirmed it slows down batteries of older models. Yet here we are, still carrying our iPhones, looking for chargers. Because at this point, going non-Apple just really isn’t an option.","That’s the beauty of “brand.” It breeds loyalty. It has longevity. It attracts love.","Brands tell a story. They make the consumer feel things. They forge a personal connection. But, Facebook has always focused on the service, not on the emotion. And yes, its product is functional, but that doesn’t mean it has to eschew the connection. No service is more functional than Amazon, but its brand is full of connection. Just look at its Super Bowl commercials. They were fun, heartwarming, engaging -- and they were also a great PR effort for Jeff Bezos. The ads humanize a utilitarian brand, creating affinity and loyalty among consumers.","Steve Jobs was the inspirational, intelligent and beloved CEO who made it seem that, more than anything, he cared about moving society forward. Apple’s goal was making your life better, easier, more efficient, more fun -- and consumers loved that idea.","Once Jobs was gone, Elon Musk wanted to take on this role. And through tireless efforts, he’s successfully filled those grey New Balance sneakers. Zuckerberg, on the other hand, hasn’t tried to enter this space. And now, it’s biting him in the you-know-where.","Tesla and SpaceX have had plenty of production issues. Potential bad press follows Musk around like a bad boyfriend, but we still love him and his companies. And that’s because he’s able to create a narrative of innovation and inspiration that consumers and investors are always willing to stand behind. He mystifies them. He charms them. He makes them fall in love with him. He's got a bit of a P.T. Barnum effect, actually.","And that’s what Zuckerberg is missing.","Facebook is at a pivotal point in its history. Currently, if we’re talking about its relationship status with the public, “it’s complicated.” But, with the right personification and branding, it can get back in the public’s good graces despite the information crisis, and people will keep sending \"friend requests\" and tagging photos. Just like people keep buying iPhones.","So, what needs to change? Right now, Facebook’s brand communications are entirely transactional. Zuckerberg tells us what is happening but not why it’s happening. And as a result, people view the brand from a place of utility. Nobody loves Facebook; they just use Facebook. It’s a product, not a brand. And if the platform is going to survive this PR nightmare, it needs people to feel a legitimate and emotional connection to it. It can’t just count on consumers using Facebook because it’s convenient; they need people to love using Facebook.","Facebook needs to take its consumers on a journey, one that paints an inspirational and powerful vision of the future. It needs to create a narrative that makes Facebook an integral part of a better tomorrow. It needs to feel helpful, but human. It needs a brand story. It needs a bit of Barnum.","And it shouldn’t be hard to do! Facebook -- as a platform, as a brand, as whatever you want it to be -- is already about “making the world a better place by connecting people.” That’s a powerful message that consumers can get behind.","But now, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica crisis, we’re seeing what happens when the world doesn’t get better by connecting people. And since Facebook hasn’t spent time telling us a powerful narrative about the good side of connecting people, we’re primed to believe and to become easily swayed by the bad side.","It’s time for Facebook to realize that it is a brand. And then, for it to begin acting as such. It needs to invest time and effort into making people love them.","It’s time for Facebook to change the narrative and turn its story into something positive.","If Zuckerberg wants to save his company, he needs to strike an emotional chord. He needs to earn his consumers' trust. He needs to create a future-looking brand story, one that makes Facebook feel important and inspirational -- and imperative.","He needs to take us back to 2008, when we were all constantly changing our profile pictures and friending everyone we met. Back to poke wars and 60-photo albums, and afternoons spent writing on people’s walls.","He needs to make us fall in love with Facebook all over again.","More from Entrepreneur","Are paying too much for business insurance?

ZUCK: yea i'm going to fuck them ZUCK: probably in the year ZUCK: *ear","In another exchange leaked to Silicon Alley Insider, Zuckerberg explained to a friend that his control of Facebook gave him access to any information he wanted on any Harvard student:","ZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard ZUCK: just ask ZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns FRIEND: what!? how'd you manage that one?

The movie is a scathing portrait, and the image of an unsmiling, insecure, and sexed-up young man will be hard to overcome.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

The Strategy of Tension","Full article: Strategy of Tension","During his trial, Vincenzo Vinciguerra revealed that, in addition to discrediting left wing political groups, there had been a second aim behind the bombings - to inculcate a climate of fear among the general populace.

As Vincenzo Vinciguerra summarized during his trial:","‘You had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple. They were supposed to force these people, the Italian public to turn to the State to ask for greater security.’","In Francovich's documentary on Gladio, he described the aim as to ‘destabilise in order to stabilise’… ‘To create tension within the country to promote conservative, reactionary social and political tendencies.’ ...","...The Scandal Spreads","Fortuitously for the powers-that-be Andreotti’s revelations coincided with Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait and as a result did not garner the publicity they almost certainly otherwise would have. Even so, the scandal began to spread. In October Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou confirmed there had been a Gladio network in Greece. In Germany a TV programme shocked the nation by revealing how former members of Hitler’s Special Forces SS had been part of a German stay-behind network. The Belgian Parliament appointed a special committee to investigate the existence – confirmed by the defence minister – of a Belgian Gladio network.","Most sensitively the Belgian parliamentarians discovered that the secret NATO army was still active. They found that a secret meeting of Generals directing the secret stay-behind armies in the numerous countries in Western Europe had been held in the secret NATO-linked Gladio headquarters ACC as recently as October 23 and 24, 1990. The meeting of the ACC had taken place in Brussels under the chairmanship of General Raymond Van Calster, chief of the Belgian military secret service SGR (Service General de Renseignement).[5]","In France President Mitterand claimed that the French Gladio network had been dissolved long ago but to his enormous embarrassment Andreotti then claimed the French had taken part in the recent meeting in Brussels. And so it went on. British defence officials refused to comment. In Portugal, contrary to official denials, a retired general confirmed there had been such a network in Portugal, while in Spain former defence minister Alberto Oliart claimed it was childish to \"ask whether also under dictator Franco a secret right-wing army had existed in the country because 'here Gladio was the government'.\"[6]","In Turkey former prime minister Bulent Ecevit went even further and admitted that a secret army had been involved in torture, massacres, assassinations and coups d'etat, prompting the serving defence minister Giray to retort \"Ecevit had better keep his fucking mouth shut!\"[7]","The EU Debate","In all, 12 EU countries were affected and on November 22 1990 the European Parliament debated the issue.","The tone was set by Greek parliamentarian Ephremidis:","'Mr. President, the Gladio system has operated for four decades under various names.

Silence from NATO, CIA & MI6","NATO reacted to these revelations in November 1990 with confusion.

Access was via a bank vault type door and papers were circulated with the stamp ‘American Eyes Only.’","The revelations began to mount and a picture emerged of a NATO Clandestine Planning Committee, responsible for the Gladio armies; of protocols which actively protected right-wing extremists from pursuit since they would be useful in anti-Communist activities. The CPC was run by the US with the UK and France as junior partners, with CIA members present at their meetings. Despite numerous revelations from those who took part, the official NATO position was (and is) one of denial. Official CIA response to information requests has been to neither confirm nor deny.

Save the customary comment of the ministry of defence that they don't discuss matters of national security.'","(DG p.36)","Paradoxically, despite the secrecy, an exhibition at the Imperial War Museum tacitly admitted the existence of the stay behind networks, and subsequent to this, two former Royal Marine officers admitted to having spent time at Fort Monckton near Portsmouth where MI6 and members of the SAS trained foreign gladiators.\nPrecursors","The original models for the secret armies had been set up in the UK during WW2 by Section D of MI6.

Officially SOE was closed down in 1946 and gave way to a successor - Special Operation (SO) - created under the auspices of MI6 to translate the same networks into resistance in countries overrun by the Soviets.

His documentary interviews key figures in Gladio such as Licio Gelli, head of the P2, Italian right-wing activist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, Venetian judge and Gladio discoverer Felice Casson, Italian Gladio commander General Gerardo Serravalle, Senator Roger Lallemand, head of the Belgian Parliamentary inquiry into Gladio, Decimo Garau, former Italian instructor at the Sardinian Gladio base, William Colby, former Director of CIA and Martial Lekeu, former member of the Belgian Gendarmerie to name but a few. ...","... Prudent precaution or Source of Terror?","At the end of his book, Ganser asks this question in an attempt to draw out the historical lessons. The answer is of course both. The strategic need for the stay-behind armies was reasonable in the light of what was known at the time, but the excesses directed against the people and democratic institutions of the host countries amounted to a wholly unacceptable assault on the sovereignty of these countries, of a sort that was familiar in Warsaw Pact countries but which was assumed to be absent from NATO countries. The terrorist bombings proved to be a means by which Pentagon planners were able to take their own (imaginary or delusional) fears about the rise of the Left and turn them into very real and concrete fears for the populace. The swiftness with which the fear of Communism has since been transmuted following the end of the Cold War into a fear of Islamic terrorism, along with the arrival of the whole security-military-industrial-complex paraphernalia of the \"War on Terror\" illustrates that this is almost a modus operandi of military planners. It’s as if they can’t help themselves. In light of this information, there is now a vast army of people around the world who reject the official government narrative of what happened on 9/11 and suspect there may have been US government complicity in the attacks. Opponents cry out that such a thing is unthinkable and that ‘they’ would never do such a thing. But as Ganser’s meticulously footnoted history of the Gladio armies makes clear: it may be unthinkable but it certainly isn’t unprecedented.","Ganser’s Conclusion in full: ...","... Based on the fear of a potential invasion after the Second World War highly placed officials in the national European governments, in the European military secret services, in NATO as well as in the CIA and the MI6 therefore decided that a secret resistance network had to be set up already during peacetime. On a lower level in the hierarchy citizens and military officers in numerous countries of Western Europe shared this assessment, joined the conspiracy and secretly trained for the emergency. These preparations were not limited to the 16 NATO member countries, but included also the four neutral countries in Western Europe, namely Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, on which the author is preparing a second publication. In retrospect it has become obvious that the fear was without reason and the training had been futile for the invasion of the Red Army never came. Yet such a certainty was not available at the time. And it is telling that the cover of the network, despite repeated exposures in many countries during the entire Cold War, was only blown completely at exactly the same moment when the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union collapsed.","The secret stay-behind armies of NATO, however, were also a source of terror, as the evidence available now shows. It has been this second feature of the secret war that has attracted a lot of attention and criticism in the last decade, and which in the future will need more investigation and research. As of now the evidence indicates that the governments of the United States and Great Britain after the end of the Second World War feared not only a Soviet invasion, but also the Communist Parties, and to a lesser degree the Socialist Parties. The White House and Downing Street feared that in several countries of Western Europe, and above all in Italy, France, Belgium, Finland and Greece, the Communists might reach positions of influence in the executive and destroy the military alliance NATO from within by betraying military secrets to the Soviet Union. It was in this sense that the Pentagon in Washington together with the CIA, MI6 and NATO in a secret war set up and operated the stay-behind armies as an instrument to manipulate and control the democracies of Western Europe from within, unknown to both European populations and parliaments. This strategy lead to terror and fear, as well as to \"humiliation and maltreatment of democratic institutions', as the European press correctly criticised.","Experts of the Cold War will note that Operation Gladio and NATO's stay-behind armies cast a new light on the question of sovereignty in Western Europe. It is now clear that as the Cold War divided Europe, brutality and terror was employed to control populations on both sides of the Iron Curtain. As far as Eastern Europe is concerned, this fact has long been recognised, long before it had been openly declared. After the Red Army had in 1968 mercilessly crushed the social reforms in Prague, Soviet leader Leonid Breschnew in Moscow with his infamous 'Breschnew doctrine' had openly declared that the countries of Eastern Europe were only allowed to enjoy 'limited sovereignty'. As far as Western Europe is concerned the conviction of being sovereign and independent was shattered more recently. The data from Operation Gladio and NATO's stay-behind armies indicates a more subtle and hidden strategy to manipulate and limit the sovereignty, with great differences from country to country. Yet a limitation of sovereignty it was. And in each case where the stay-behind network in the absence of a Soviet invasion functioned as a straightjacket for the democracies of Western Europe, Operation Gladio was the Breschnew doctrine of Washington. The strategic rationale to protect NATO from within cannot be brushed aside lightly. But the manipulation of the democracies of Western Europe by Washington and London on a level which many in the European Union still today find difficult to believe clearly violated the rule of law and will require further debate and investigation. In some operations the secret stay-behind soldiers together with the secret military services monitored and filed left-wing politicians and spread anti-Communist propaganda. In more violent operations the secret war led to bloodshed. Tragically the secret warriors linked up with right-wing terrorists, a combination that led - in some countries including at least Belgium, Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey - to massacres, torture, coup d'etats and other violent acts. Most of these state-sponsored terrorist operations, as the subsequent cover-ups and fake trials suggest, enjoyed the encouragement and protection of selected highly placed governmental and military officials in Europe and in the United States. Members of the security apparatus and the government on both sides of the Atlantic who themselves despise being linked up with right-wing terrorism must in the future bring more clarity nd understanding into these tragic dimensions of the secret Cold War in Western Europe.","If Cold War experts will derive new data from NATO's stay-behind network for their discourse on limited sovereignty during the Cold War, then international legal experts and analysts of dysfunctions of democracies will find data on the breakdown of checks and balances within each nation. The Gladio data indicates that the legislative was unable to control the more hidden branches of the executive, and that parliamentary control of secret services is often non-existing or dysfunctional in democracies on both sides of the Atlantic. Totalitarian states have long been known to have operated a great variety of largely uncontrolled and unaccountable secret services and secret armies. Yet to discover such serious dysfunctions also in numerous democracies comes as a great surprise, to say the least. Within this debate of checks and balances military officials have been correct to point out after the discovery of Operation Gladio and NATO's stay-behind network that there can never be such a thing as a 'transparent stay-behind army', for such a network would be exposed immediately in case of invasion and its members would be killed by the invasion force. Parliamentarians and constitutional lawyers meanwhile have been equally correct to emphasise that both the armed forces and the secret services of a democracy must at all times be transparent, accountable, controlled and supervised closely by civilian representatives of the people as they represent the most powerful instruments of the state.","This clash between mandatory secrecy and mandatory transparency, which lies at the heart of the Gladio phenomenon, directly points to the more general question of how much secrecy should be granted to the executive branch of a democracy. Judged from the Gladio evidence, where a lack of transparency and accountability has lead to corruption, abuse and terror, the answer is clear: The executive should be granted no secrecy and should at all times be controlled by the legislative. For a secret government, as it manifested itself in the United States and parts of Western Europe, can lead to abuse and even state terrorism. The growth of Intelligence abuses reflects a more general failure of our basic institutions', US Senator Frank Church had wisely noted after a detailed investigation of CIA covert operations already in the 1970s. Gladio repeats this warning with a vengance.","It can hardly be overemphasised that running a secret army and funding an unaccountable intelligence service entails grave risks every democracy should seek to avoid. For the risks do not only include uncontrolled violence against groups of citizens, but mass manipulation of entire countries or continents. Among the most far-reaching findings on the secret war, as seen in the analysis, ranges the fact that the stay-behind network had served as a tool to spread fear amongst the population also in the absence of an invasion. The secret armies in some cases functioned as an almost perfect manipulation system that transported the fears of high-ranking military officers in the Pentagon and NATO to the populations in Western Europe. European citizens, as the strategists in the Pentagon saw it, due to their limited vision were unable to perceive the real and present danger of Communism, and therefore they had to be manipulated. By killing innocent citizens on market squares or in supermarkets and blaming the crime on the Communists the secret armies together with convinced right-wing terrorists effectively translated the fears of Pentagon strategists into very real fears of European citizens.","The destructive spiral of manipulation, fear and violence did not end with the fall of the Soviet Union and the discovery of the secret armies in 1990, but on the contrary gained momentum. Ever since the vicious terrorist attacks on the population of the United States on September 11, 2001 and the beginning of the 'War on Terrorism' fear and violence dominate not only the headlines across the globe but also the consciousness of millions. In the West the 'evil Communist' of the Cold War era has swiftly been replaced with the 'evil Islamist' of the war on terrorism era. With almost 3,000 civilians killed on September 11, and several thousands killed in the US-led war on terrorism so far with no end in sight, a new level of brutality has been reached.","Such an environment of fear, as the Gladio evidence shows, is ideally suited to manipulate the masses on both sides into more radical positions. Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaida terror network manipulated millions of Muslims, above all young male adults, to take up a radical position and believe in violence. On the other side also the White House and the administration of George Bush junior has fuelled the spiral of violence and fear and lead millions of Christians and seculars in the United States and in Europe to believe in the necessity and justice of killing other human beings in order to enhance their own security. Yet human security is not being advanced, but on the contrary decays, as the atmosphere is drenched with manipulation, violence and fear. Where the manipulation and the violence originate from and where they lead to, is at times very difficult to dissect. Hitler and the Nazis had profited greatly from manipulation and the fear in the wake of the mysterious Reichstagsbrand in Berlin in 1933, whereupon the Third Reich and Second World War followed. In 2001 the war on terrorism began, and once again radical critics have argued that the White House had manipulated 9/11, the largest terrorist attack in history, for geostrategic purposes. ...","Dead thread by now, I know, but dumping this which I started working on a couple of days ago now, I guess, anyway, 'as is', as the house-hold/personal care chemicals of some visitors staying here for an undetermined period have been making me too freaking sick, tired and ill to sometimes breathe properly or even see or think straight and some bits in here may come in useful to anyone happening to notice and bothering to read it.

Sample this except from Business Insider: Facebook executives waded into a firestorm of criticism on Saturday, after news reports revealed that a data firm with ties to the Trump campaign harvested private information from millions of Facebook users. Several executives took to Twitter to insist that the data leak was not technically a “breach.” But critics were outraged by the response and accused the company of playing semantics and missing the point.

This year marks a milestone in the web’s history: for the first time, we will cross the tipping point when more than half of the world’s population will be online.","When I share this exciting news with people, I tend to get one of two concerned reactions:","How do we get the other half of the world connected?","Are we sure the rest of the world wants to connect to the web we have today?","The threats to the web today are real – from misinformation and questionable political advertising to a loss of control over our personal data. But I remain committed to making sure the web is a free, open, creative space – for everyone.","That vision is only possible if we get everyone online, and make sure the web works for people. I founded the Web Foundation to fight for the web’s future. Here’s where we must focus our efforts:","Close the digital divide","The divide between people who have internet access and those who do not is deepening existing inequalities, inequalities that pose a serious global threat. Unsurprisingly, you’re more likely to be offline if you are female, poor, live in a rural area or a low-income country, or some combination of the above. To be offline today is to be excluded from opportunities to learn and earn, to access valuable services, and to participate in democratic debate. If we do not invest seriously in closing this gap, the last billion will not be connected until 2042. That’s an entire generation left behind.","A legal or regulatory framework that accounts for social objectives may help ease tensions","In 2016, the UN declared internet access a human right, on par with clean water, electricity, shelter and food. But until we make internet access affordable for all, billions will continue to be denied this basic right. The target has been set – the UN recently adopted the Alliance for Affordable Internet’s threshold for affordability: 1GB of mobile data for less than 2% of average monthly income. The reality, however, is that we’re still a long way off from reaching this target – in some countries, the cost of 1GB of mobile broadband remains more than 20% of average monthly income.","What will it take to actually achieve this goal? We must support policies and business models that expand access to the world’s poorest through public access solutions, such as community networks and public wifi initiatives. We must invest in securing reliable access for women and girls, and empowering them through digital skills training.","Make the web work for people","The web that many connected to years ago is not what new users will find today. What was once a rich selection of blogs and websites has been compressed under the powerful weight of a few dominant platforms. This concentration of power creates a new set of gatekeepers, allowing a handful of platforms to control which ideas and opinions are seen and shared.","These dominant platforms are able to lock in their position by creating barriers for competitors. They acquire startup challengers, buy up new innovations and hire the industry’s top talent. Add to this the competitive advantage that their user data gives them and we can expect the next 20 years to be far less innovative than the last.","What’s more, the fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponise the web at scale. In recent years, we’ve seen conspiracy theories trend on social media platforms, fake Twitter and Facebook accounts stoke social tensions, external actors interfere in elections, and criminals steal troves of personal data.","We’ve looked to the platforms themselves for answers. Companies are aware of the problems and are making efforts to fix them – with each change they make affecting millions of people. The responsibility – and sometimes burden – of making these decisions falls on companies that have been built to maximise profit more than to maximise social good. A legal or regulatory framework that accounts for social objectivesmay help ease those tensions.","Bring more voices to the debate on the web’s future","The future of the web isn’t just about those of us who are online today, but also those yet to connect. Today’s powerful digital economy calls for strong standards that balance the interests of both companies and online citizens. This means thinking about how we align the incentives of the tech sector with those of users and society at large, and consulting a diverse cross section of society in the process.","Tim Berners-Lee on the future of the web: 'The system is failing'","Read more","Two myths currently limit our collective imagination: the myth that advertising is the only possible business model for online companies, and the myth that it’s too late to change the way platforms operate. On both points, we need to be a little more creative.","While the problems facing the web are complex and large, I think we should see them as bugs: problems with existing code and software systems that have been created by people – and can be fixed by people. Create a new set of incentives and changes in the code will follow. We can design a web that creates a constructive and supportive environment.","Today, I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions for the web. I want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfil our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions.","As the late internet activist, John Perry Barlow, once said: “A good way to invent the future is to predict it.” It may sound utopian, it may sound impossible to achieve after the setbacks of the last two years, but I want us to imagine that future and build it.","Let’s assemble the brightest minds from business, technology, government, civil society, the arts and academia to tackle the threats to the web’s future. At the Web Foundation, we are ready to play our part in this mission and build the web we all want. Let’s work together to make it possible."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-12"}

They also offered to use Ukrainian sex workers and companies employing ex-spies to help dig dirt on political candidates.","Cambridge Analytica, for its part, denies the allegations made in the report, calling it \"edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.\"","A Channel 4 reporter posing as a fixer for a wealthy client who wanted to get candidates elected in Sri Lanka met with senior executives from Cambridge Analytica in London on four occasions between November 2017 and January 2018.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix attended one meeting, and the company's chief data officer Alex Tayler attended two meetings. On all occasions Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate, SCL Elections, was present. The reporter also recorded one phone call between himself, Nix and Turnbull.","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, speaks at the 2016 Concordia Summit in New York.","Bryan Bedder / Getty Images","The report aired following a weekend of revelations about the company and its exploitation of Facebook data to try and manipulate the behavior of millions of voters. Reports by The New York Times and Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica misused data harvested by University of Cambridge researcher Aleksandr Kogan, allowing the firm to better target around 50 million Facebook users with political ads.","But according to the Channel 4 report, Cambridge Analytica is prepared to go beyond data analysis, psychometric profiling and serving targeted ads to help political candidates into office.","In one meeting, Nix offered to \"send some girls around to the candidate's house,\" adding that Ukrainian girls \"are very beautiful, I find that works very well.\" Nix implied this was a tactic Cambridge Analytica has used in the past, saying, \"we have lots of history of things,\" and, \"I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done.\"","In another meeting, he explained to the reporter how he would create video evidence of corruption and put it online. \"We'll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land, for instance, we'll have the whole thing recorded, we'll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the Internet.\"","Nix described to the reporter in one exchange how his company finds what matters to the voter group it's targeting and uses it to influence them. In Sri Lanka, said the reporter, it would matter to people if they found out a minister was homosexual. \"These are things that, I mean, it sounds a dreadful thing to say but these are things that don't necessarily need to be true, as long as they're believed,\" Nix said.","Both Nix and Turnbull detailed the ways in which Cambridge Analytica goes incognito and disguises its footsteps so that it won't be linked to the spread of propaganda or specific campaigns. The company sometimes uses subcontractors, including British and Israeli companies, or sets up locally under the guise of university research or tourism to dig up dirt on political candidates and circulate it online, they said.","\"We have many clients who never wish to have our relationship with them made public,\" Nix told the reporter. \"We're used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you.\"","Cambridge Analytica, which also refutes the claims made by the Times and the Guardian, told Channel 4, in a statement: \"We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever. ... Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.\"","The firm later emailed a statement saying that \"after several meetings discussing ostensibly legitimate projects, the reporter unexpectedly and suddenly turned the conversation towards practices such as corruption and the entrapment of political figures. ...

They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again.\"","The statement goes on to say that Nix, however, \"acknowledges that on this occasion he misjudged the situation.\"","\"In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios.

You should resist the urge to let it, at every turn.","There’s a new menu item in the Facebook app, first reported by TechCrunch on Monday, labeled “Protect.” Clicking it will send you to the App Store and prompt you to download a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service called Onavo. (“Protect” shows up in the iOS app. Gizmodo looked for it on an Android device and didn’t see it—though, presumably it is only a matter of time.)","Advertisement","Millions of people use VPNs to enhance their privacy online. But that is not Onavo’s function.","Onavo link in Facebook for iOS (Gizmodo)","VPNs work by forcing your laptop or mobile device to establish a connection to a third-party server before then connecting you to any websites or online services. Using an encrypted tunnel, a VPN can prevent your broadband or wireless provider (AT&T, Comcast, et al) from keeping track of the websites you visit. What’s more, a VPN service can mask your own IP address from those websites, helping you to traverse the net without surrendering locational data. VPNs also help users in authoritarian countries bypass censors by convincing websites their country of origin is, for example, the US or Switzerland, the latter of which has some of the world’s strictest privacy laws.","Advertisement","Facebook, however, purchased Onavo from an Israeli firm in 2013 for an entirely different reason, as described in a Wall Street Journal report last summer. The company is actually collecting and analyzing the data of Onavo users. Doing so allows Facebook to monitor the online habits of people outside their use of the Facebook app itself. For instance, this gave the company insight into Snapchat’s dwindling user base, even before the company announced a period of diminished growth last year.","To put it another way, Onavo is corporate spyware.","If you’re someone who can’t live without Facebook or simply can’t find the courage to delete it, the Onavo appears under the “Explore” list just above the “Settings” menu.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market.

The law punishes hacking under the computer crime statutes. These crimes carry penalties ranging from a class B misdemeanor (punishable by up to six months in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both) to a class B felony (punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a fine of up to $15,000, or both). The law also punishes unauthorized access to a computer or computer network, with penalties ranging from a class B misdemeanor to a class D felony (punishable by up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000, or both).","A number of generally applicable crimes could also apply. For example, hacking could be done to commit identity theft or larceny and it could be punished under those generally applicable crimes.","In addition to criminal penalties, the law specifically authorizes someone harmed by a computer or unauthorized use crime to bring a civil lawsuit against the perpetrator. These civil actions are in addition to any other grounds for a civil action that the injured party may have.","3. intentionally or recklessly disrupts, degrades, or causes disruption or degradation of computer services or denies or causes denial of computer services to an authorized user; or","4. intentionally or recklessly tampers with, takes, transfers, conceals, alters, or damages any equipment used in a computer system.","It is also a computer crime to misuse computer system data. A person commits this crime by:","1. accessing a computer system to use, disclose, or copy data residing in, communicated by, or produced by a computer system;","2. intentionally or recklessly and without authorization (a) tampering with, damaging, or taking data intended for use by a computer system or (b) intercepting or adding to data residing within a computer system;","3. knowingly receiving or retaining data obtained through misuse of computer system information; or","4. using or disclosing data he or she knows or believes was obtained through misuse of computer system information (CGS � 53a-251).","The punishment for committing one of these computer crimes depends on the damage caused and risk of harm created. Table 1 displays the five degrees of computer crime, the amount of damage or harm required for each, and their penalties.","Damage to or the value of the property or computer services is over $10,000","B felony (up to 20 years in prison, a fine of up to $15,000, or both)","2nd degree","Damage to or the value of the property or computer services is over $5,000","C felony (up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000, or both)","3rd degree","● Damage to or the value of the property or computer services is over $1,000","● Reckless conduct that creates a risk of serious physical injury to another person","D felony (up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000, or both)","4th degree","Damage to or the value of the property or computer services is over $500","A misdemeanor (up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $2,000, or both)","5th degree","Damage to or the value of the property or computer services, if any, is $500 or less","B misdemeanor (up to six months in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both)","By law, the value of property or computer services in a computer crime is (1) their market value; (2) if they are unrecoverable, damaged, or destroyed, the cost of reproducing or replacing them; (3) $250 if their value or damage cannot be satisfactorily ascertained; or (4) $1,500 for private personal data (CGS � 53a-259).","The law allows the court to require someone convicted of a computer crime to pay up to double the amount of the defendant's gain from the crime, instead of paying a fine (CGS � 53a-257).","The law gives Connecticut courts jurisdiction whenever any act in furtherance of a computer crime occurs in this state or any computer system or part of one accessed in a computer crime is located in this state (CGS � 53a-261).","UNAUTHORIZED USE OF COMPUTER OR COMPUTER NETWORK","It is a crime to use a computer or computer network without authority and with the intent to:","4. create or alter a financial instrument or an electronic funds transfer;","5. cause physical injury to another's property;","6. make or cause to be made an unauthorized copy of computer data, programs, or software residing in, communicated by, or produced by a computer or computer network; or","7. falsify or forge email information or other routing information in any manner in connection with the transmission of unsolicited bulk email through or into the computer network of an electronic mail service provider or its subscribers.","This crime is a class B misdemeanor but if the person causes over $2,500 in property damage it is a (1) class A misdemeanor if the person acted with reckless disregard for the consequences of his or her actions and (2) class D felony if the person acted maliciously (CGS � 53-451).","TERRORISM","The law makes it a class B felony if a person commits a computer crime or unauthorized use of a computer or computer network with intent to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or a unit of government. When the crime is directed against a public safety agency, the law imposes a five year mandatory minimum sentence (CGS � 53a-301).","OTHER CRIMES","Depending on the circumstances, a person who hacks into another's computer could be punished by a number of generally applicable crimes.","For example, if the hacking is done to take personal identifying information for certain purposes, it could be punishable as identity theft.

Larceny is intentionally and wrongfully taking, obtaining, or withholding property from an owner in order to appropriate it to himself, herself, or another. The penalties for larceny range from a class C misdemeanor (punishable by up to three months in prison, a fine of up to $500, or both) to a class B felony, primarily based on the value of the property taken (CGS � 53a-118 et seq.).","CIVIL ACTIONS","The law specifically authorizes someone harmed by a computer or unauthorized use crime to bring a civil lawsuit against the perpetrator. These civil actions are in addition to any other grounds for a civil action that the injured party may have.","Computer Crime","Anyone who believes a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in a computer crime can file a civil action for (1) a temporary or permanent order preventing the activity; (2) restitution; or (3) appointment of a receiver.","A person who suffers a personal injury or damage to his or her business or property can also bring an action for damages. The person can recover actual damages, unjust enrichment, triple damages if the defendant acted wilfully and maliciously, reasonable costs, and reasonable attorney's fees (CGS � 52-570b).","Unauthorized Use","A person whose property or person is injured by unauthorized use of a computer or computer network can bring a civil action to enjoin further violations and to recover actual damages, including lost profits, and the costs of the action (CGS � 53-452).

Mike Conaway (R-TX), released a statement on Monday saying that they had uncovered “no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.” Conaway — who had replaced Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) following the latter’s significant breaches of conduct — added that, in addition to the one-page statement, the panel had also completed a substantial draft report, which is yet to be released.","The committee’s statement on Monday, however, went beyond just absolving the Trump campaign of any suspected collusion with Moscow, even going so far as to dispute the U.S. Intelligence Community’s findings that Russia had preferred a Trump presidency to that of Hillary Clinton. The statement also added that the Clinton campaign had obtained “anti-Trump research” from Russian sources, an apparent nod to the disputed Steele memo.","Advertisement","The draft report will now likely go to the minority staff on the committee, currently led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA). However, it remains possible — or likely — that the Democrats will push to release a second, competing report. Democrats have complained that a number of key witnesses still have not been interviewed by the committee, and that Republicans on the committee didn’t bother to use subpoenas in order to obtain pertinent information.","“By ending its oversight role in the only authroized investigation in the House, the Majority has placed the interests of protecting the President over protecting the country and history will judge its actions harshly,” Schiff said Monday evening in an extensive statement. “During the first open hearing of our investigation, I asked whether we could conduct this investigation in the kind of thorough and nonpartisan manner that the seriousness of the issues merited… Regrettably, that challenge proved too much.”","Further, Republicans cut short the witness interview portion of the investigation — something Schiff only learned of on Monday afternoon. Among the witnesses who were reportedly not called before the committee were Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chair, and Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser.

{"originalurl":"http://splitsider.com/2018/02/how-facebook-is-killing-comedy/","title":"How Facebook Is Killing Comedy","text":["How Facebook Is Killing Comedy","Last month, in its second round of layoffs in as many years, comedy hub Funny or Die reportedly eliminated its entire editorial team following a trend of comedy websites scaling back, shutting down, or restructuring their business model away from original online content.","Hours after CEO Mike Farah delivered the news via an internal memo, Matt Klinman took to Twitter, writing, “Mark Zuckerberg just walked into Funny or Die and laid off all my friends.” It was a strong sentiment for the longtime comedy creator, who started out at UCB and The Onion before launching Pitch, the Funny or Die-incubated joke-writing app, in 2017.","But Klinman explained in a thread: “There is simply no money in making comedy online anymore. Facebook has completely destroyed independent digital comedy and we need to fucking talk about it.”","We’re not sure about you, but that certainly piqued our interest. We sat down with Klinman to fucking talk about it (and just a note–these opinions are his, and he’s speaking for himself and not on behalf of Funny or Die).","So: What happened at Funny or Die?","Funny or Die just went through a period of changing their business model. Now it’s going to focus on long-form content like televisionand branded content and less on original content made for the internet. They are being very supportive of the people who they had to lay off as far as continuing projects that they already had, but the way they ran things just no longer made any sense.","Let’s talk about the Twitter thread you wrote on the day of the layoffs.","How I felt on the day of was that a ton of my friends – people who I respect a lot and who are great comedy writers – were just laid off, and at this point it was increasingly clear to me that this is not a management problem or a problem with the content that they are making. The problem was that the whole business model made no sense, as far as us just putting the stuff up on the internet and us being able to make a living on it. I was just angry and frustrated and sad that you can’t make cool shit for the internet anymore and make a living.","The whole story is basically that Facebook gets so much traffic that they started convincing publishers to post things on Facebook. For a long time, that was fine. People posted things on Facebook, then you would click those links and go to their websites. But then, gradually, Facebook started exerting more and more control of what was being seen, to the point that they, not our website, essentially became the main publishers of everyone’s content. Today, there’s no reason to go to a comedy website that has a video if that video is just right on Facebook. And that would be fine if Facebook compensated those companies for the ad revenue that was generated from those videos, but because Facebook does not pay publishers, there quickly became no money in making high-quality content for the internet.","In these situations recently, like with Cracked, people get mad at the management and at the companies. I’m a labor dude, I’m a proud member of the WGAE, and I’m more than happy to get mad at management about something, but it’s increasingly clear that that’s not the problem. The problem is that Facebook is our editor and our boss. They decide what is successful and what isn’t successful via seemingly meaningless metrics. They hide behind algorithms that they change constantly. And it seems to me that they are not favoring things that are high-quality – they are favoring things that are clickbait, things that are optimized for Facebook, low-quality things that appeal to the lowest common denominator and, honestly, just things at random.","Facebook has created a centrally designed internet. It’s a lamer, shittier looking internet. It’s just not as cool as an internet that is a big, chaotic space filled with tons of independently operating websites who are able to make a living because they make something cool that people want to see.","How did this all happen?","Facebook is essentially running a payola scam where you have to pay them if you want your own fans to see your content. If you run a large publishing company and you make a big piece of content that you feel proud of, you put it up on Facebook. From there, their algorithm takes over, with no transparency. So, not only is the website not getting ad revenue they used to get, they have to pay Facebook to push it out to their own subscribers. So, Facebook gets the ad revenue from the eyeballs on the thing they are seeing, and they get revenue from the publisher. It’s like if TheNew York Times had their own subscriber base, but you had to pay the paperboy for every article you wanted to see.","The worst part is that as an artist, it feels like your own fault. We’re used to a world where if you put something out there that’s good, people see it and share it. But that’s just not true in this world. Someone can make something really good, and just because of some weird algorithmic reasons, or if it’s not designed specifically for Facebook, it doesn’t do well. And then it becomes impossible to know what a good thing to make is anymore.","Facebook is an absolutely fine repository for the names of people I’ve met in my life, and for photos I have of those people, and it would be a nice memorial to my life when I’m dead. But it has no business being a publisher, and they don’t even like to acknowledge that that’s what they are. Facebook hides behind all of this machinery, when what they’re doing is very human. Recommending things for people is a personal act, and there are people who are good at it. There are critics. There are blogs. It’s not beneficial to us to turn content recommendations over to an algorithm, especially one that’s been optimized for garbage.","Well, this is scary and depressing. What can we do to fix it?","First, linking out would be great. It would at least get people back to normal websites. Remember when your fingers just remembered different URLs, and you would go to The New York Times, and The Onion, and Funny or Die? Now it’s less so. You type in Facebook or Twitter or Reddit and then you just sit there and passively take in this feed of what’s selected for you.","The other alternative would be to just pay, like cable had to do. When someone does high-quality labor, you pay. The debate a few years ago was that the writers of digital publishers should unionize – that we should fight for our rights against management. That was a great idea, but what we didn’t know was that movement happened when these places started getting demolished by Facebook, but there’s no reason to unionize if management isn’t getting super rich off of your work. It’s Facebook getting rich off of your work.","The other solution, which seems crazy, is for there to be a meta organizing campaign, where media companies band together and refuse to post on Facebook, essentially going on strike and withholding their labor until they are compensated. These media companies need leverage against this massive entity that is eating their lunch. That’s the labor problem.","Zuckerberg is saying “I want to fix Facebook this year.” Well this, to me, is the biggest thing that needs fixing. They don’t pay, and that would be okay if it was possible to run a business using their platform, but you can’t. Media companies are full of smart people trying to make it work, but Facebook is this black box, and it’s impossible to run a digital media company if you can’t have consistent knowledge about what you’re publishing or why.","So of course places like Funny or Die, which has had success in more predictable systems, are going to shift their resources to television. They were founded because they want to employ writers and editors and directors to make cool shit, and currently they can employ more people making television than they can making stuff for the internet. It’s a shame, because the internet was a place where you could say and do anything, where you could make ambitious things or crazy things that wouldn’t work on traditional television. Take, for example, Homestar Runner, which was more than a website – it was a whole ecosystem. It was beautiful, created with love, a work of art. If you made that now, there would be no way to drive traffic to it, no way to know about it, because Facebook wouldn’t link out to a cool website. Even if you did get people to see it one time, it would be increasingly difficult to go a second or third time, because it’s not optimized for the feed.","This writer John Herrman writes about this a lot – he used to write for The Awl, rest in peace – he talks about how Facebook flattens everything out and makes it the same. That’s how we have a Russian propaganda problem. An article from something like, I don’t know, Rebel Patriot News written by a Macedonian teen or something looks exactly the same as a New York Times article. It’s the same for comedy websites. There’s a reason that Mad magazine looks different from Vanity Fair. They need to convey a different aesthetic and a different tone for their content to really pop. Facebook is the great de-contextualizer. There’s no more feeling of jumping into a whole new world on the internet anymore – everything looks exactly the same.","Herrman, who you can tell I like a lot, also talks about how Facebook is essentially AOL 2.0. They’ve made little websites for everyone, from companies and individuals, and it’s all on their centrally planned internet. They control our memories, and it traps us there and makes us feel like we can’t leave. My family and friends are there, posting life updates I want to see. Then you start scrolling, and hours pass by, and you’re dazed. You might not even remember if you saw a cool thing, because it kind of all blends together.","You’re really depressing me.","Well, there are all these studies that Facebook is literally depressing. There was a study recently that if you just give your cat a bowl of food every day, they get fat and depressed, because they don’t use their hunting instincts. So now some pet owners hide food around their house, and their pets are happier because they’re doing something. It’s the same thing with content. It’s better for us to try and find it, and get it from different sources and enter different worlds – to go on the tiniest journey to find something instead of having the trough open up and have the feed come pouring down into your face.","Let’s go back to Homestar Runner. That was super popular when I was in college, but it spread through word of mouth and was monetized through merchandise–there were no ads. Are we putting on rose-colored glasses when we look at how things used to be on the internet?","All that I can say is that it was possible to employ comedy writers online even two years ago, before this all happened. If someone’s starting out in comedy right now, I want to be able to tell them: Get work wherever you can. Submit jokes or freelance or whatever. Then you’ll get thrown bigger and bigger things, and then maybe you’ll be put on staff somewhere, and then maybe you’ll move on to television or a movie. But right now there’s no pipeline and no growth. There’s no incentive to make a collaborative project online.","Facebook says that they are building communities, but really they’re fracturing us. We are all on our own little news bubbles and on our own little islands. It’s also fracturing our own creative projects. The internet has turned into a place where you can’t have many different people speaking as one entity and expect those people to make a living. And to me, those are the most exciting, rewarding projects, and I can’t make those now. I am looking at the past with rose-colored glasses, but you can say categorically that the internet was a better place 3-4 years ago. It used to be fruitful, but it’s like a desert now.","Here’s another analogy, and I learned this in an ecology class: In the 1800s (or something), there were big lords, or kings or something, who had giant estates with these large forests. And there were these foresters who had this whole notion of how to make a perfectly designed forest, where the trees would be pristinely manicured and in these perfect rows, and they would get rid of all the gross stuff and dirt. It was just trees in a perfect, human-devised formation that you could walk through. Within a generation, these trees were emaciated and dying. Because that’s how a forest works – it needs to be chaotic. It needs bugs and leaves, it makes the whole thriving ecosystem possible. That’s what this new internet should be. It won’t survive as this human-designed, top-down thing that is optimized for programmatic ads. It feels like a desert. There’s no nutrition, there’s no opportunity to do anything cool.","Facebook put all this money into Live, and a bunch of cool things sprang up. And that’s because they put money into it. They gave water to the desert, and people flocked to it, because there are so many cool and creative people out there who want to make things with love. If you aren’t paying people, those things aren’t going to happen. But then Facebook stopped the live thing and then that was it.","What do you think the future of comedy on the internet looks like right now?","Right now it’s memes. I think memes are great, but it’s literally the smallest unit of an idea. And they are being made by individual people for free. I made a platform, Pitch, where the whole point of it is to pay people for jokes because I hated seeing people just giving work away for free. You may be getting traction as a young meme maker who is part of the new internet, but without this middle layer of digital comedy, there aren’t places to see you and hire you up for something bigger. There are just fewer and fewer opportunities that will be there for you if you do something cool.","I yearn for the days when my struggle was wanting to make something crazy, but wondering if advertisers of my website would be cool with it. I wish those were the arguments that I was having. I find myself talking to sales people from these companies, and we’re on the same page. They are the ones who see this more than anybody.","But I feel like one of the central problems is that people don’t expect to pay for content anymore.","It’s like eating locally or shopping locally. We need to think the same way about the internet. When you go to Facebook, you’re going to Walmart. And every time you go and scroll through content on Facebook, you’re depriving independent media of a way to exist. I’m still on Facebook, although almost exclusively to post anti-Facebook things. It’s a funny joke, but it’s also the only place to see it and engage with it. Facebook feels like this dingy, disgusting, rapacious place to me. And I want it to feel that way to other people so that when they go to a cool website, they are inspired: They see human beings putting love and care into something.","But at this point, don’t we need some sort of platform that organizes and curates content?","It’s difficult to find things on the internet, being the cat searching around the house for its food. We’re too busy to do all of this shit. I understand that desire, but there needs to be a balance. If I could make a law, it would be that only real people can recommend things to other people. Zeynep Tufekci has this TED talk that is about how machine learning and algorithms turn us into crazy people. They drive us toward more and more extreme beliefs. If a certain number of people watch a Trump rally video, then YouTube recommends you a slightly more alt-right video, and suddenly you’re three steps away from watching a video about how Hitler was correct, if you let it autoplay. The EU has a bunch of laws kicking in to keep this in check – one is algorithmic transparency, where these places need to tell me why they are showing me something. Like, if Facebook is showing me an article, it needs to tell me why.","Facebook flattens out content, but it is also flattening out people. It’s turning us into robots. I’m going to sound like Alex Jones here, but this is how it works. Facebook needs humans to be as predictable as robots, because their business model is if you pay Facebook a certain amount of money for a certain amount of reach, they need to guarantee you get it. So in order for that to be dependable and sellable, people need to be essentially as reliable as bots. You just keep showing someone the same thing over and over until they engage with it. Or you get rid of everything else that’s interesting and make a world where all you get is your Facebook-optimized feed – that’s all the nourishment you will get, just your feed. A flattened internet is a predictable internet, and a flattened person is a predictable person.","What do you want to come from what happened at Funny or Die?","The next time some cool place cuts back or shuts down, I want people to not blame that place, I want them to blame what’s going on. I want people to think about what people are doing online in the same way that you think about what you buy at the grocery store or what shop you go to.","Is any comedy outlet doing well? For example, is The Onion in danger?","I would gladly give money to anyone who could tell me of any digital publisher that is doing well other than Facebook. And woe to those who want to start something new right now.","What advice would you give to a comedian who starting up right now?","I would say go to Palo Alto, go to One Hacker Way, walk into the front door of Facebook, and demand to know what the hell they’re doing. Someone told me that crazy people show up at Facebook every day because it ruined their lives, usually because of a personal reason, and I’m so close to being one of those crazy people. But instead of “Why did my wife leave me because of you?” it’s like, “Why did you destroy the internet comedy scene?”","Live comedy still rules. There’s cool stuff going on. Just make stuff. What you are seeing in comedy is that it’s swinging toward standup. It’s great and I have no problem with standup, but it’s not collaborative, it’s one person.","The whole other part of this is that we’re going back to a world in which, if you are a rich white man who is able to run an Instagram meme feed, you can still eke by right now. But imagine if you’re someone who doesn’t have that privilege – maybe you have student loan debt. Places like Funny or Die were finally equaling out our writing staff. It was something we really cared about. Can you imagine, if there’s no money, how can you get diverse voices into comedy if there’s no way for them to start out? It’s really bleak.","What would you say if you did go to One Hacker Way like a crazy person?","It’s the Jurassic Park lesson: Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. You need to think through what you’re doing. If someone at Facebook sees this, I want them to know, if they care at all about the idea that was the internet, they need to start thinking through what they are doing. Otherwise, then you’re just like Lennie from Of Mice and Men – a big dumb oaf crushing the little mouse of the internet over and over and not realizing it. I’m sure that these are smart people who had a good mission at the start, and I’m sure they love the internet. But they need to start being thoughtful of what they’re doing.","Sarah Aswell is a freelance writer and standup who lives in Missoula, Montana.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2DDfRMJ?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.37ad27bfcc22","title":"Facebook may have violated FTC privacy deal, say former federal officials, triggering risk of massive fines - The Washington Post","text":["Two former federal officials who crafted the landmark consent decree governing how Facebook handles user privacy say the company may have violated that decree when it shared information from tens of millions of users with a data analysis firm that later worked for President Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Such a violation, if eventually confirmed by the Federal Trade Commission, could lead to many millions of dollars in fines against Facebook, said David Vladeck, who as the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the subsequent consent decree resolving the case in 2011. He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Most recently, there’s the small matter of the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, which is causing users to leave Facebook in droves. But there is an alternative. Our guide to Facebook’s privacy settings explains all you need to know to keep using the popular social network safely.","The recent allegations that Facebook data was manipulated by UK-based Cambridge Analytica to influence a range of world events from Donald Trump’s election to the Brexit vote has shaken the technology world to its core.","What’s a privacy-conscious social media user to do if they don’t want to delete Facebook entirely, but do want to secure their account from outside meddling? Allow us to explain.","Facebook Privacy Settings: The basics explained","The entire Facebook/Cambridge Analytica affair highlights just how important it is to keep track of the apps you use − or have used in the past − that are connected to your Facebook account through Facebook Login. This is because the data was gathered through an app called ‘thisisyourdigitallife’, which allowed people to log in to it using their Facebook account.","You can find a list of apps that have access to your Facebook data, such as your name, pictures, birthday and friends list, on the App Settings page. There’s a good chance the list will be significantly longer than expected.","Clicking each entry in the list shows you the types of data you’ve given them permission to access. By unchecking each box, you can limit how many of your personal details they can get their hands on. You can also unlink the apps from your Facebook account on this page, by clicking the ‘X’ that appears next to them.","Latest","However, as Facebook’s FAQ notes, “The app or game may have stored info from when you were using it, but you can contact the developer to ask that they delete any info they may still have.”","You can also switch off Facebook’s integration with apps completely, meaning you won’t be able to log into apps, games and other websites using your Facebook account. To do this, go to Settings, Apps and Websites and Plugins, then select Edit and Disable Platform.","Raj Samani, chief scientist at McAfee, says that using your Facebook account to login to another app “bridges your digital islands, allowing the two companies to collect more data and build an in depth profile about you and your activity.”","He recommends going even further to protect your data. “Set up a new login and password for the apps you’re using. It may take a minute longer but it will help you to avoid data being shared between different services,” he told Trusted Reviews.","Now that you understand the crux of the issue, here are 18 simple ways you can ensure your Facebook privacy settings are exactly what you want them to be.","1) I want to…get an overview of my privacy settings","Facebook’s privacy settings are spread over a number of portions of the site. However, you can do a quick health check by tapping the padlock to the right of the Home screen and selecting Run Privacy Check Up. This will allow you see privacy settings at a glance over three key areas of Facebook","1) Posts – As explained below, this will explain how to control your privacy settings for every post.\n2) Apps – Who sees your activity within third-party apps\n3) Profile – Here you can limit what personal information (work, age, contact details) is visible to who.","These are explained in more detail in the next three sections.","2) I want to… control who sees my posts","This is perhaps the key privacy concern of Facebook users who’re concerned. No-one wants their boss spying on their weekend activities, so it’s important to be clear about when you post. Whenever you upload a photo, fill in a status, or check in at a location there’s the opportunity to customise who you wish to share with. You can also adjust this by clicking the padlock and selecting “Who can see my stuff?”\nThe three main options are:","Friends – Only people you’re friends with can see the post. If you’re posting photos of your children or any information you’d deem personal then this is what you need to select.","Public – Anyone can see it whether they’re friends or not. If you want to be part of a public discussion to be seen by friends and within search; like on Twitter, then select this.","Only You – Perhaps if you use Facebook as a repository for personal memories or a blog you can select Only You to ensure you, the account holder are the only one who sees it.","Here you can also select Custom to add Friends of Friends to the list of people who can see the post while there’s also the opportunity to post only for the eyes of various Groups you may be part of.","It is important to note that Facebook remembers the setting from your last post, so if your last post was a Public rant about X-Factor, remember that’ll be the default setting next time.","3) I want to… control who sees my app activity","You’re likely to have many third-party services associated with Facebook, whether they’re news services, fitness apps, games, other social networks, streaming services or photo-sharing apps. Many become associated with your Facebook account by being installed on your smartphone, others by using Facebook Connect to create accounts. You can use the Privacy Check Up or go to Settings > Apps and adjust who can see your activity or whether you want to remove them completely by clicking the cross.","4) I want to… hide my personal information","Over the years, Facebook has probably collected a tonne of personal information. Your email address, your birthday, political views, phone number, where you’ve studied, your sexual orientation, your political views, where you’re from, where you’re worked, who you’re married to and who you’re related to.","With most employers now doing social media checks on potential employees, you may want to shield some of this sensitive information. In the US for example, it’s still legal for employers to fire gay people.","Thankfully, much of this can be controlled via the Privacy Check Up mentioned above. You can alter who sees what by heading to the About section of your profile and selecting Edit under each section. To alter privacy settings from Friends to Only Me will hide the information from your profile. In many cases you may want to remove it completely by clicking the X.","5) I want to… hide posts from other people","If you’re still friends with an ex on Facebook, it might be considered poor form to post photos of you in a new relationship in a place where he/she can see them. You can get around this by hitting Custom from the “Who should see this?” menu and tagging people you wish to hide the post from.","This is also a good way to prevent that outspoken friend embarrassing you by commenting on a controversial subject.","6) I want to… post something, but hide it from my timeline","Maybe you have something to say and don’t want it as a permanent record on your timeline, a thought, a meme, a joke in context that’s of its time, a photo, etc. You can achieve this by ticking the Hide From Timeline box in the post field.","7) I want to… stop people sharing my photos and posts","If you’ve shared a photo or a status on Facebook, it’s open to be re-shared by those who have access to it. That means Friends and, if you’ve tagged people, Friends of Friends. If the post is Public then anyone in the world can share it There’s no way around that, other than to set the post to Only Me in the first place, which kind of defeats the point in most cases.","8) I want to… check what my Public profile looks like","As all profiles are now searchable within Facebook, you may want to check how your profile looks to someone who stumbled upon it. To do this you can head to Settings > Followers and tap “Want to know what followers can see? View your public Timeline.” Here you can see how it looks to the Public. If you spot information or posts you do not want to be public Edit the privacy settings of individual posts or go to Settings to censor it from the public.","You can also use this tool to see what a specific friend sees.","9) I want to… change who can see old posts","In the early days of Facebook we were quite naïve with what we shared. Thankfully, within Settings > Privacy, you can rectify some of your past privacy mistakes. You can click Limit Old Posts, which will change any posts listed as Public or Friends of Friends and clicking Confirm, to ensure only Friends can see them. This can be undone at a later date.","10) I want to… limit who can send me friend requests","Click Settings > Privacy and head to “who can send me friend requests.” You can change it from Everybody to Friends of Friends, but that’s about as far as you can go. This is also accessible form the Privacy Shortcuts accessed by clicking the padlock.","11) I want to… block someone","This one’s easy (and fun). Use the Privacy Shortcuts or go to Settings > Blocking, begin typing the name of the friend (or ex-friend) you wish to block from your account. You can also block certain people from sending you messages, but you have to be friends with them.","It’s also possible to block people people you’re not friends with by heading to their profile, clicking the “…” on the right hand side and selecting Block.","12) I want to… limit who can look me up through contact information","Facebook probably has your phone number and some email addresses. If folks (i.e. potential employers, old flames, stalkers, etc.) were to enter these in search, they may be able to discover your profile. In Settings > Privacy you can correct this by selecting either Everyone, Friends of Friends or Friends.","13) I want… my Facebook page kept off Google","There’s no hiding from Facebook’s overarching Search engine, all you can do is lock down your privacy settings and hope you have a common name. However it’s different in the case of other search engines like Google. Within Settings > Privacy, you can ensure your Facebook profile is exempt by selecting No.","14) I want to… hide my real name","The right to anonymity was and, in some cases, still is one of the most cherished tenets of the internet. With Facebook now showing all profiles within search results, changing to an assumed name seems a good idea for those who don’t want to be discovered, have been harassed work in sensitive industries, have been discriminated about etc…","Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. Facebook makes you use your birth name when signing up and has very strict rules about changing it thereafter. If you’re reported for a fake name it could suspend your account. The company has softened its stance following feedback from victims of abuse and the LGBTQ community.","15) I want to… protect my location","Facebook loves it when you check into places, it gobbles up all of that lovely data to attract advertisers. However, you may want to protect your location. The very obvious step is not to click the location pin when posting.","However, when you’re using the mobile app, Facebook may try to use GPS and Wi-Fi to name your location. You can prevent this from happening by entering the Location settings on your mobile device and denying Facebook access.","In iOS it goes: Settings > Privacy > Location > Facebook > Never","16) I want to… prevent/remove a tag","Down the years, our friends have tagged us in some damn awful stuff. Developed social media etiquette, and full knowledge of potential consequences, mean it doesn’t happen so much these days. However help is at hand.","In Settings > Timeline and Tagging you can ask to review every tag before it appears on your or anyone else’s timeline.","You can always select Remove Tag within individual post settings. If the post is offensive, you can also Report Post if you want it off the site altogether.","17) I want to… make my profile completely private","Until last October, it was possible to hide your Facebook account, so it would not show up within search. When the company broadened its Universal Search through the Knowledge Graph initiative, it no longer became an option.","Now, even if your privacy settings are completely locked down you’ll appear within search results. There’s still information people can glean from that, such as the profile picture, your list of friends and the pages you’ve liked.

The friend must approve the post to their timeline, but if they do, all of their friends will be able to see it too. For example, if you’re tagging a friend in a photo featuring your child, you’re expressing consent that people outside of your friendship circle can view it, react to it, share it and even comment on it.","So, in other words, if you’re concerned about who might view the photo, tagging friends is best avoided.","Share your thoughts on the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal with us @TrustedReviews."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Now, Facebook wants to make the process of managing a user's data more streamlined through a portal called \"Access Your Information.\"","Courtesy Facebook","Users will be able to see their every action on Facebook and decide if they want to delete it. That includes every like, message, event response, and any other mundane action on Facebook that could be used to profile a person.","The idea is to make it more useful for people to take control of their information, allowing them to see what Facebook has collected — and to wipe the slate clean, if they so choose.","A single screen for settings","Settings can be a tricky and less-than-intuitive place for users to navigate. Facebook's mobile settings were previously spread across nearly 20 screens, but will now be condensed into one.","Users will be able to jump right into their personal information or change their password in the security section, among other actions, instead of going through layers to find the one setting they really need.","Courtesy Facebook","Privacy shortcuts","This is Facebook's one-stop shop for finding more information about privacy, security and ads. Privacy shortcuts have been around for a few years (you may recall the cartoon dinosaur mascot Facebook attached to them).","The Privacy Shortcuts menu is also getting a simplified makeover to make the experience more visual and easier to navigate.","This is the menu where users can manage their audiences for various posts and review friend requests they've sent, posts they've reacted to, and other actions, all with just a few taps. Don't like something? Facebook will let users delete it here.","The revised menu also provides some practical security options, enabling users to turn on two-factor authentication, which requires them to enter a code sent to their phone when they log in from a new device, creating an extra layer of security.","Facebook says the new tools are just the start. In the coming weeks, they're planning other measures to be more transparent, including an updated policy about the data they collect and how it is used, along with proposed updates to Facebook's terms of service that underscore the social network's commitments to its users.","Breaking News Emails","Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The firm allegedly obtained data from millions of Facebook users and used that data to help President Trump get elected in 2016. NPR's Peter Overby gives us a look at some of the potential legal problems here.","PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: In an undercover video by television 4 News (ph) in England, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix took credit for almost everything in the Trump campaign except the make America great again hats. He said his firm did all the data, research, analytics and targeting, the digital campaign and the television campaign, and, quote, \"our data informed all the strategy.\" The firm did this in part with data mined from 50 million Facebook users. So here's a question.","BRETT KAPPEL: Did Cambridge Analytica give any of that information, any of that data to the Trump campaign? Did they actually give them the data?","OVERBY: Brett Kappel is a campaign finance lawyer in D.C. The question matters because Donald J. Trump For President paid Cambridge Analytica less than $6 million for the entire campaign. Estimates for the Facebook data run into the tens of millions. If it's really that much, then the campaign got an extremely expensive and highly illegal contribution from a corporation, and a foreign corporation at that. The FEC is timid about a lot of things, but Kappel notes this.","KAPPEL: The Federal Election Campaign Act's prohibition on foreign national contributions is the broadest prohibition in the entire statute.","OVERBY: Here's another issue. It's illegal for foreign nationals to hold decision-making positions in American elections. Remember the CEO's list of all the things Cambridge Analytica did? If any of it involved decision-making, such as going ahead with an ad buy, that could be a problem. It's worth noting that corporate and foreign contributions are two of the core prohibitions most likely to get the attention of Justice Department prosecutors.","Cambridge Analytica had a second client, a pro-Trump superPAC called Make America Number 1, also known as Stop Crooked Hillary PAC (ph), which indicates its mission in the general election campaign. Cambridge Analytica treated the campaign committee and the superPAC as one project. It's a violation of campaign finance law to coordinate messaging between a campaign and a superPAC, but the FEC says a company can serve both clients if it creates two teams and walls them off from each other. That's what Cambridge Analytica says it did, so this arrangement that seems obviously dicey probably isn't.

The announcement was made by Facebook's Erin Egan, VP and Chief Privacy Officer, Policy and Ashlie Beringer, VP and Deputy General Counsel during a couple of weeks which have seen the social media platform come under attack for being embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica saga.","Facebook users can now access all their settings, including privacy settings, on one screen instead of them being available across many different screens.","A comparison of the old settings menu (left) and new settings menu (right).","\"We’ve redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top to bottom to make things easier to find. Instead of having settings spread across nearly 20 different screens, they’re now accessible from a single place. We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,\" said Egan and Beringer in a statement announcing the changes.","Before this announcement, after days of silence, Fcebook's Founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, issued a statement on the Cambridge Analytica saga in which he also explained the steps they have already taken in addressing the issues raised so far. Part of those changes and steps that Zuckerberg mentioned included a tool at the top of a Facebook user's News Feed which would show the apps a user has used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to their data.","According to Facebook, the new centralized privacy dashboard will allow users to:","Add more layers of protection to your account, like two-factor authentication.

It has been many months of allegations and arguments that the internet in general and social media in particular are pulling society down instead of lifting it up.","That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google. At the furthest extreme, some dream of the companies becoming public utilities. More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed, although it’s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous.","Image","The Cambridge Analytica case “is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,” said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality.CreditFrancois Lenoir/Reuters","Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors, such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising, said Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","There are other avenues still, said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, the chief marketing officer of Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser, including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers.","“They are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms,” Mr. Kaykas-Wolff said of online marketers. This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network’s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.","The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.","The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.","The Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. “This is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,” she said.","Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.","Consumers’ seemingly benign activities — their likes — could be used to covertly categorize and influence their behavior. And not just by unknown third parties. Facebook itself has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting, describing its services in a company case study as “influencing voters.”","“People are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,” said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. “If your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone’s life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.”","In interviews, Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation, something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago. But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad-supported internet at risk.","Image","Facebook has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting, once describing its services as “influencing voters.”","“You’re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising: reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product,” said Dean C. Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter.","If suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.","“We’re at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,” said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. “This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.”","In May, the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. The new rules treat personal data as proprietary, owned by an individual, and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission — opting in rather than opting out — after receiving a request written in clear language, not legalese.","Mélanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.","Image","Users detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google, generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising.CreditSergio Perez/Reuters","In a January speech in Brussels, Facebook’s Ms. Sandberg said, “We know we can’t just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.” Google declined to comment.","The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum — and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.","“With the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,” said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. “We now have a way to hold these companies accountable.”","But any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.","Privacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status, health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior-based ads. They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people.","Industry groups successfully argued that collecting personal details posed no harm to consumers and that efforts to hinder data collection would chill innovation. Instead, the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads, although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected.","“If it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there’s a case to be made for federal regulation” under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.","The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.","If the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.","That would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.","“To know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,” said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.","There’s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world’s remedy for any problem is always more technology.","“If Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,” said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. “But well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix. It’s like a child running a bulldozer. They don’t have any sense of the damage they can do.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The rest of the mainstream press has followed suit, promoting a campaign—without any evident popular following—for users to leave the social media company, complete with a ready-made hashtag: #DeleteFacebook. In response to the campaign, Facebook’s stock price has fallen by 11 percent, wiping out some $50 billion from the company’s market capitalization.","The harvesting of the personal information of some 50 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica raises serious privacy concerns. But the media firestorm sparked by the synchronized release of the story by the New York Times and the Guardian has far darker and more nefarious motives. Using the election data scandal as a cover, the media, working with the intelligence agencies and leading congressional Democrats, is seeking to create the climate for a crackdown on political opposition on the world’s largest social network.","From the standpoint of bourgeois election campaigns, massive data harvesting operations are par for the course. In 2012, the Obama reelection campaign did essentially the same thing as Cambridge Analytica, prompting users to install a Facebook app that harvested the information of users’ entire contact list, netting up to 190 million profiles. At the time, the practice was not only widely reported, but praised by major news outlets as evidence of the innovative and forward-thinking nature of the campaign.","Moreover, despite having access to Cambridge Analytica’s massive trove of Facebook information, the Trump campaign did not choose to use the data because it already had access to an even bigger, more comprehensive, and more accurate dataset from the Republican National Committee.","Flush with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, secured from billionaire donors who are wealthier than ever, modern bourgeois election campaigns employ hundreds, or even thousands, of staff members, many with advanced computer science and statistics degrees, to mine, quantify, and analyze private data, with the aim of influencing and shaping voters' political views.","These operations massively dwarf the scale of the alleged “meddling” by “Russians” in the 2016 presidential election, which, according to a report submitted by Facebook to the Senate Intelligence Committee, consisted of buying some $100,000 of Facebook advertisements both before and after the election.","Given the diminutive scale of the role played by Cambridge Analytica in the election campaign, what accounts for the massive campaign in the press for users to “Delete Facebook?”","The real issues underlying the campaign can be seen in another report, published on the front page of the New York Times Wednesday, headlined, “Fed Up, Teachers in Oklahoma May Walk Next,” warning that the strike movement by educators, which began in West Virginia, risks spreading to Oklahoma, Arizona, and other states.","The article notes that “several Facebook groups” have been “pushing for a walkout,” and that “Rank-and-file teachers” have used the social media network to organize outside of the framework of the teachers’ unions.","The growth of working-class opposition is the real target of the media firestorm over Facebook’s alleged data lapse. The aim of the press campaign is to create the climate for the introduction of even more explicit censorship measures.","In successive interviews responding to the allegations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, reversing their previous positions, vociferously endorsed a bill working its way through Congress to target “foreign meddling” in US politics by severely restricting the purchase of political advertisements—one of the few avenues left open to independent news outlets to attract a broader readership on Facebook.","“We’re open to regulation. We work with lawmakers all over the world,” Sandberg told CNBC. Zuckerberg, speaking to CNN, said he would “love to see” regulation targeting Facebook advertisements like those allegedly purchased by “Russians.”","In his CNN interview, Zuckerberg pledged to redouble Facebook’s efforts to combat the efforts of “folks trying to sow division.” He said the company would “do a better job of tracing and using AI tools to be able to scan and observe a lot of what is going on.” He said that he was open to further government regulation of the company, that is, a greater integration of Facebook with the state and its intelligence agencies.","He then went on to say that Facebook now employs “15,000 people working on security and content review,” and that this number would rise to 20,000 by the end of the year.","This amazing admission means that, based on the company’s employee headcount of 25,000 at the beginning of this year, most of the company’s employees are engaged in reviewing and censoring user content. From a company nominally dedicated to helping users share information and learn about the world, Facebook is being transformed into an instrument of police repression and censorship.","The media is working to create the political climate for the further implementation of mass censorship on the world’s largest social media platform.","Behind the scenes, the campaign has been accompanied by the announcement this week by Google of a “news initiative” aimed at censoring independent news outlets like the World Socialist Web Site and promoting “trustworthy” news sources such as the New York Times and Washington Post. The announcement marks a significant intensification of measures, beginning with changes in Google’s search algorithm last April, that have led to a massive drop in search traffic to left-wing, anti-war, and socialist web sites.","Workers entering into struggle to defend their jobs, wages, and working conditions must see the drive toward censorship for what it is: not only an existential threat to their constitutionally protected freedom of expression, but an effort to smash their efforts at self-organization and struggle to break free of the grip of the trade union bureaucracy.","We urge all workers and young people who understand the importance of this fight to contact the World Socialist Web Site and join its campaign against Internet censorship."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

But for me the most consequential story of late was that a self-driving car operated by Uber — with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and tragically killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz.","I could only look at that deeply unsettling story and say: Welcome to the second inning — the second inning of one of the world’s great technological leaps, the implications of which we’re just beginning to understand.","But first, let’s acknowledge one thing: The first inning was amazing.","It was an inning full of promise, discovery and marvel. In the early 2000s, a set of technologies came together into platforms, social networks and software that made connectivity and solving complex problems fast, virtually free, easy for you, ubiquitous and invisible. Suddenly, more individuals could compete, connect, collaborate and create with more other people, in more ways, from more places, for less money and with greater ease than ever before. And we sure did!","We became our own filmmakers and reporters; we launched political and social revolutions from our living rooms; we connected with long-lost family and friends; we found the answers to old and new questions with one click; we searched for everything from spouses to news to directions to kindred spirits with our phones; we exposed dictators and branded ourselves. With one touch, we could suddenly call a taxi, direct a taxi, rate a taxi and pay a taxi — or rent an igloo, rate an igloo and pay for an igloo in Alaska.","And then, just as suddenly, we found ourselves in the second inning. The cool self-driving car killed a pedestrian; the cool Facebook platform enabled Russian troll farms to divide us and inject fake news into our public life; the uncool totalitarian government learned how to use the same facial recognition tools that can ease your way through passport control to single you out in a crowd for arrest.","And Mark Zuckerberg, who promised to connect us all — and that it would all be good — found himself on the cover of Wired magazine, with his face cut, bruised and bandaged, as if he’d been hit by a fastball. He wasn’t alone. In inning two, we started to feel beat up by the same platforms and technologies that had enriched, empowered and connected our lives.","Silicon Valley, we have a problem.","What to do? For problems like this, I like to consult my teacher and friend Dov Seidman, CEO of LRN, which helps companies and leaders build ethical cultures, and the author of the book, “How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything.”","“The first inning’s prevailing ethos was that any technology that makes the world more open by connecting us or makes us more equal by empowering us individually must, in and of itself, be a force for good,” Seidman began. “But, in inning two, we are coming to grips with the reality that the power to make the world more open and equal is not in the technologies themselves. It all depends on how the tools are designed and how we choose to use them. The same amazing tech that enables people to forge deeper relationships, foster closer communities and give everyone a voice can also breed isolation, embolden racists, and empower digital bullies and nefarious actors.”","Equally important, Seidman added, these “unprecedented and valuable tools of connection” are being used with great accuracy and potency “to assault the foundations of what makes our democracies vibrant, capitalism dynamic and our societies healthy — namely, truth and trust.”","And they have begun to be used “to assault our personal foundations — our privacy and sense of identity,” Seidman said: “It is one thing to use our data to enable better shopping experiences, but when my beliefs and attitudes are mined and manipulated for someone’s political campaign, a campaign that may be antithetical to my beliefs, that is deeply harmful and unmooring.” So what to do? “Precisely because we are in just the beginning of a technological revolution with a long, uncertain, up-and-down road ahead, we need to start by pausing to reflect on how our world, reshaped by these technologies, operates differently — and on the kind of values and leadership we will need to realize their promise.”","Values are more vital now than ever, Seidman insisted. “Because sustainable values are what anchor us in a storm, and because values propel and guide us when our lives are profoundly disrupted. They help us make the hard decisions.” Hard decisions abound, because everything is now connected. “The world is fused. So there no place anymore to stand to the side and claim neutrality — to say, ‘I am just a businessperson’ or ‘I am just running a platform.’ ”","No way. “Once you see that your technologies are having unintended consequences, you cannot maintain your neutrality — especially when you’ve become so central to the lives of billions of people.”","In the fused world, Seidman said, “the business of business is no longer just business. The business of business is now society. And, therefore, how you take or don’t take responsibility for what your technology enables or for what happens on your platforms is inescapable. This is the emerging expectation of users — real people — who’ve entrusted so much of their inner lives to these powerful companies.”","To be sure, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should all be commended for trying to find engineering solutions to prevent them from being hacked and weaponized.","“But this is not just an engineering problem, or just a business model problem,” he said. “Software solutions can increase our confidence that we can stay a step ahead of the bad guys. But, fundamentally, it will take more ‘moralware’ to regain our trust. Only one kind of leadership can respond to this kind of problem — moral leadership.”","What does moral leadership look like here?","“Moral leadership means truly putting people first and making whatever sacrifices that entails,” said Seidman. “That means not always competing on shallow things and quantity — on how much time people spend on your platform — but on quality and depth. It means seeing and treating people not just as ‘users’ or ‘clicks,’ but as ‘citizens,’ who are worthy of being accurately informed to make their best choices. It means not just trying to shift people from one click to another, from one video to another, but instead trying to elevate them in ways that deepen our connections and enrich our conversations.”","It means, Seidman continued, being “fully transparent about how you operate, and make decisions that affect them — all the ways in which you’re monetizing their data. It means having the courage to publish explicit standards of quality and expectations of conduct, and fighting to maintain them however inconvenient. It means having the humility to ask for help even from your critics. It means promoting civility and decency, making the opposite unwelcome. It means being truly bold — proclaiming, for example, that you will not sleep until you’re certain that our next democratic election won’t be hacked.”","At the height of the Cold War, when the world was threatened by spreading Communism and rising walls, President John F. Kennedy vowed to “pay any price and bear any burden” to ensure the success of liberty.","Today, falling walls and spreading webs — which criminals and nations can use to poison democratic societies — are becoming the biggest threat to the success of liberty. You will know that the good guys are winning when you see big tech companies rise to Kennedy’s challenge — to pay any price and bear any burden to protect us from the downsides of the technologies they’ve created."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma.","A few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds.","Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window.","Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach","Read more","But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments.","When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality.","The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default.","“The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said.","“Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.”","To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.","The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well.","The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable.","Aleksandr Kogan","To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters.","It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use.","And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred.","It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another.","The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database.","Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed.","Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”.","Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach.","It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Its shares fell a further 1.8 percent.","In London, the head of Britain’s cross-party Media parliamentary committee also wrote to Zuckerberg asking for more information. “We would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March,” lawmaker Damian Collins wrote.","In Dublin, Ireland’s privacy watchdog said it was following up with Facebook to clarify its oversight. The Irish body is the lead regulator for Facebook in the European Union because the network’s European headquarters are in Dublin.","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.","According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by the-then future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon.","Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also their friends’.","Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.","Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.","Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.","Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.","GRAVE VIOLATION","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica’s London office, among other companies. It was not clear which firm they were going to.","Slideshow (9 Images)","“We are not alone in using data from social media sites to extract user information,” Cambridge Analytica said. “No Facebook data was used by our data science team in the 2016 presidential campaign.”","Denham, head of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said on Monday she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after seeing an investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 news which secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections.","She said it would not take long to obtain the warrant.","“We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection,” Cambridge Analytica said.","Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data. The auditors were in Cambridge Analytica’s offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities.","The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds ($700,000) but will gain the power to fine an organization up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","“This story comes on the back of increasing scrutiny and societal unease with FB’s potential impact on kids as well as increasing concerns around the power of mega cap Internet names, setting the stage for deeper investigation,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note, keeping his “buy” rating on Facebook stock.","Walmsley said he was worried “about how scrutiny could ultimately impact Facebook’s ability to gather and deploy data for ad targeting, which has been critical to ad efficacy and budget growth”.","The company said last month it had 1.4 billion active daily users, up 14 percent from a year earlier.

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies.

The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign.","Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","\"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August.

It was real-estate mogul Donald J. Trump. The San Antonio web designer had built websites for the Trump organization before but this request from his client was far bigger than anything the then 39-year-old Kansan had ever worked on before.","A day earlier, Trump descended the escalator at his Manhattan Tower to a basement full of supporters and journalists to announce his bid for the White House. Trump told Parscale on the phone he wanted him to build a full presidential campaign website.","Parscale had no political or campaign experience but in the ensuing seventeen months he would build the most aggressive digital media campaign for a president anyone had ever seen. The 6’7″ web designer assembled a team in San Antonio, Texas where he lived while Donald Trump began doing the rounds on cable news.","“You think you’d be able to get along with Vladimir Putin,” Sean Hannity asked Trump on Fox News. “Did you talk to him?”","“I don’t want to say,” Trump dodged the question, then added with something of a wink: “Putin truly hates Obama. He thinks he’s terrible. He thinks he’s arrogant. He thinks he’s just terrible.”","At exactly the same time Trump said he was open to dealing with Putin, a Russian company funded by a “close Putin ally with ties to the Russian intelligence” began buying ads on Facebook supporting Trump campaign issues and continued doing so throughout the campaign. The social network describes the ads bought by Internet Research Agency as “amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights”","Trump launched his campaign with a tirade against Mexicans immigrants and proposed a border wall. “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some I assume are good people but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting,” he told supporters.","On Facebook, a Russian created community called “SecureBorders” with 133,000 followers, began publishing racists ads to amplify Trump’s message, including one of a cartoon Trump dangling a man wearing a T-shirt with a Mexican flag over a wall with the headline “You have to go back pal”.","An example of the type of content produced by a Russian propaganda machine in St. Petersburg and placed on Facebook.","Russian oligarch Evgeney Prigozhin hired hundreds of Russians to pose as American conservatives and post fake news on issues closely aligned to the Trump campaign.","“SecureBorders” and hundreds of other fake pages like “Spread Your Wings”, “Art Gone Conscious” and “Celebrities Against Obama” were created by the IRA which is funded by Russian oligarch Evgeney Prigozhin. Prigozhin was Putin’s chef for more than a decade. Since then, he’s built a catering empire serving Russian public sector and military contracts. He is now under sanctions by the U.S. for running a digital propaganda machine serving up fake news and memes to American voters.","Prigozhin pumped millions of rubles into the IRA to hire hundreds of well-paid 20 and 30-something year olds to generate content on a specific agenda. The New York Times Magazine revealed employees at the St. Petersburg agency had multiple fake Facebook accounts all created in the summer of 2014. They parroted, commented and shared content, amplifying the message across social media on Facebook groups by posing as American conservatives.","A former employee of the agency described a culture plagued with homophobia, racism and poor grammar. “You see these people with a lot of tattoos,” the insider told the New York Times Magazine. “They’re so cool, like they’re from New York; very hip clothing, very hip tattoos, like they’re from Williamsburg but they are stupid,” said Marat Burkhardt. “In office conversation, they used gay slurs to refer to [Ukrainian politician] Petro Poroshenko and called Barack Obama a monkey,” Burkhardt said.","Brad Parscale, the Trump Campaign’s Digital Director is under scrutiny for any cooperation with Russia.","Investigators want to know if the Trump Campaign coordinated efforts with a Russian propaganda army.","Facebook claims to have found $150,000 worth of ads from 470 suspicious Russian accounts but this may just be the tip of the iceberg. “This is a very significant set of data points produced by Facebook,” Congressman Adam Schiff told the Washington Post. “Left unanswered in what we received from Facebook — because it is beyond the scope of what they are able to determine — is whether there was any coordination between these social media trolls and the campaign. We have to get to the bottom of that,” Schiff said","Which brings us back to Brad Parscale. In the months after Parscale got the call from Trump to build a campaign website in June 2015, Parscale’s became something of a campaign manager involved in communicating every message for the Presidential nominee.","His company Giles-Parscale which was accustomed to billing in the double-digit thousands received $90 million dollars during the campaign, most of it destined to Facebook. Facebook was on-site at the Project Alamo headquarters in San Antonio. “They were helping us,” Trump social media director Theresa Hong told the BBC. “They were basically our “hands on” partners as far as being able to utilize the platform as effectively as possible.” Hong said.","Facebook worked alongside Cambridge Analytica in San Antonio. CA’s parent company SCL has been accused of stealing 30 million Facebook profiles through a malicious Facebook app. The social media network shut down the app in 2015. Facebook must also have been aware that Cambridge Analytica was profiling users through innocuous looking quizzes on the social network for use in the campaign.","Parscale’s team was able to identify voters in minute detail. “What I needed to do was to find smart people who came from the Republican Party, subcontractors and my own company and say how do we find these individual voters and the exact right ones,” Parscale told the Joe Page show. “I didn’t need a gut, because I had the data”.","Congressional investigation committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller want to know if someone within the campaign helped the IRA target its Facebook ads geographically, which implies granular knowledge the campaign’s progress and local issue in specific counties across the country.","Parscale testified before the House Intelligence Committee in July he was unaware of any Russian links to the his social media campaign. We “used the exact same digital marketing strategies that are used everyday by corporate America,” Parscale said in a statement. This may be true but campaigns are not corporations and are subject to regulations forbidding foreign propaganda supporting a campaign.","Dmitry Kiselyov runs Sputnik News and is known as Putin’s propaganda chief.","The FBI is now investigating if Sputnik News and Russia Today, which use Facebook to distribute content, failed to register as foreign agents.","Investigators are also probing Facebook outlet “DC Leaks” which published the first samples of material stolen by Russian hackers from the DNC and they’re investigating the role of Russian news services like Sputnik and Russia Today, as well as Breitbart, in pushing fake news on Facebook at the Kremlin’s behest.","Andrew Feinberg, a former journalist who worked for Sputnik News told Yahoo! News he received his marching orders from his mostly Russian editors at the Washington D.C. office and claims they often said, “Moscow wants this, or Moscow wants that.” Feinberg was interviewed by the FBI recently about Sputnik’s operations to determine if it is in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).","“This tells me they have good information and intelligence that these organizations have been acting on behalf of the Kremlin and that there’s a direct line between them and the [Russian influence operations] that are a significant threat to our democracy,” says Asha Rangappa, a former FBI counterintelligence agent.","Sputnik, along with Russia Today and Breitbart, relies heavily on Facebook and Google to target its news content at American consumers. If indeed Sputnik failed to register under FARA, their entire operation could become the subject of prosecution or expulsion. Dmitry Kiselyov runs Sputnik and formerly headed Russia Today and is widely referred to as Putin’s chief propagandist.","The big question now is whether the campaign coordinated its social media efforts with the Trump Campaign, and specifically Brad Parscale. If investigators are able to find this type of cooperation, it could well be the most conclusive proof of a conspiracy between Russia and Trump to influence the 2016 election yet.","2 thoughts on “Facebook The Nation”","No doubt about it.

{"originalurl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/why-facebooks-data-scandal-just-wont-quit?utm_term=.fuQ3DWrdy","title":"Facebook Has Had Countless Privacy Scandals. But This One Is Different.","text":["Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has everything: peculiar billionaires, a once-adored startup turned monolith, a political mercenary who resembles a Bond villain and his shadowy psychographic profiling firm, an eccentric whistleblower, millions of profiles worth of leaked Facebook data, Steve Bannon, the Mercers, and — crucially — Donald Trump, and the results of the 2016 presidential election.","On its face, the incident read as confirmation of many people’s worst fears — that the online platforms we live on are manipulating us, using the personal information we provided in good faith without our knowledge. Add to it that one of those many unintended outcomes could have been Donald Trump’s election and you’ve got the makings of a lasting outrage.","While the main players in the scandal — Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Trump — will occupy headlines, they’re just the context — the perfect conditions for genuine outrage. But the Cambridge Analytica scandal isn’t really about Cambridge Analytica at all.","This is a data collection scandal. This is a scandal triggered by a specific incident, but that is broadly about the ways massive companies track us, harvest information from us, and then sell us as coercion targets in sophisticated information campaigns that could be for anything from diapers to mattresses to anti-vax literature.","The story will endure not because of animosity toward political data use but because it perfectly touches upon a deeper anxiety about our online privacy that’s been building for years. Indeed, the Cambridge Analytica scandal could well be the catalyst for a much bigger targeting revolt — a full-scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we’ve used the internet for the last decade. It’s a moment that forces us, collectively, to step back and think about what we sacrificed for a more convenient and connected world. And on an internet that feels increasingly toxic it’s hard to look at the tradeoffs we’ve made and feel like we’re getting a fair deal.","2. This is every place I have been in the last twelve months in Ireland, going in so far as the time of day I was in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT","You can see this reckoning already begin play out across the media as the focus shifts from Cambridge Analytica’s deeds to more general concerns about privacy and the degree to which our personal lives are catalogued so that we can be targeted by anyone with a dollar (or ruble) to spend online. Over the weekend, Ars Technica reported that Facebook has long requested access to contacts, SMS data, and call history on Android devices, hiding behind a confusing opt-in page as cover.","On Twitter, Facebook users are downloading their data and combing through it to highlight various abuses of trust: that the company kept a record of private phone calls and text message data or that Facebook shared personal information with outside entities for ad purposes. Download your own Facebook, Google, and YouTube data and you'll find years’ worth of personal information: every photo, comment, sticker emoji, video you've ever posted online; every location you’ve visited and IP address you’ve logged in from; every search, every file, and every single website you visited. It's binary confirmation of something we perhaps all have silently suppressed. Every movement you make online — and even where you move about in the world — is fastidiously catalogued, analyzed, and ultimately sold.","Ok @Google. I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway. See recent videos I watched! I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS? 😖😡🤬 https://t.co/NdJqEYfQIV","In the wake of this revolt, a 2010 clip of Steve Jobs talking about privacy has found new resonance in recent days. In an interview with journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, Jobs is asked to weigh in on a then-recent Facebook scandal and lays out his feelings on user privacy, as Mark Zuckerberg looks on in the audience. “Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly,” he says. “I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.”","Today, the clip is presented as a face-to-face warning from Jobs to Zuckerberg and as proof of sorts that Facebook knew exactly what sort of surveillance tools it was building. Indeed, Facebook’s history of privacy scandals makes the current revelations feel all the more flagrant.","In 2007, Zuckerberg first apologized for its controversial Beacon ad program, which tracked purchases on outside sites and posted that information onto a user’s News Feed. “Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. Three years later, in a sweat-filled interrogation at another D conference, Zuckerberg repeatedly dodged direct questions about Facebook’s cavalier attitudes toward privacy. More than 11 years after Beacon, Facebook is still behaving recklessly with our personal information and still making the same apologies — the only difference is that this time the advertising systems are far more complicated and the apologies come in full-page ads in the New York Times.","The Great Targeting Revolt isn’t just about the platforms; some in the ad industry are coming clean too. On Sunday the Verge published an editorial by a former digital marketer suggesting that Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the iceberg. “The contemporary Internet runs on the exploitation of user data,” the author wrote, before citing examples of corporations flagrantly flaunting user privacy to extract data. It may seem obvious but the revelation is profound and the language is important. Marketing is passive but targeting is active and invasive. A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted. Cambridge Analytica, the piece argues, isn’t an outlier but the blueprint for the internet’s vast online ad economy.","A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted.","Now in its second week, the size of the scandal is still unclear. We know that data obtained by a researcher was improperly shared with political consultants and that Cambridge Analytica did not delete the data upon Facebook’s request, but there’s a whole lot we don’t know for sure. Is this sort of improper data sharing an isolated incident or is this just part of a systemic information-control problem inside Facebook? Did the data get passed around to data brokers, states, or other companies besides SCL and Cambridge Analytica? Was the specific profile data used in any way to help target voters in the 2016 election? More importantly, is this data actually as useful in persuading voters as the targeting firms would have us believe? And are the people at Cambridge Analytica the psychographic targeting evil geniuses they claim to be? Or is it all just a bunch of bullshit — less “mindfuck tool” and more midlevel marketing?","There’s evidence to suggest that the Cambridge Analytica team were, at the very least, likely overselling their influence. “When we first saw the pitch the first thought was ‘Why would I pay all this money for this stuff when I could just get our guy from Facebook to do this kind of thing for us?’” a former senior Trump campaign official told BuzzFeed News. And some researchers and psychologists are dubious about the effectiveness of the Facebook data in political ad targeting. Speaking to Wired UK, one researcher argued that psychographic profiling is light on actual science. Another professor who studied voter behavior inside Facebook between 2010 and 2015 told the publication that the Facebook data gathered through questionnaires like Cambridge Analytica’s “may not measure what you really care about” and could have actually corrupted the ad targeting data the company had previously collected.","But none of that may matter much anymore at this point. The scandal feels like a watershed moment no matter how effective Cambridge Analytica may have been. Not only has the outrage endured more than a full week of news cycles, but it seems now as if in it the Big Tech backlash has reached a critical mass, sparking an unprecedented crisis. It’s caught the eye of lawmakers across the world — Zuckerberg has been summoned by Parliament in the UK and asked to testify in Congress by multiple senators; Facebook is now under an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission about its mishandling of Cambridge Analytica data; and across the world, company executives are getting skewered by governments in nations like the UK and, worse, Singapore, where officials suggest the company has lost their trust. It’s prompted more direct talk — even from Zuckerberg himself — of regulation. Anti-monopoly advocates are calling on the FTC to restructure Facebook, suggesting a spinoff of Facebook’s ad network and even the reversal of the company’s WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions to make them competing social networks. It even appears that inside Facebook itself there’s confusion and a sense of dwindling morale. And while the blowback isn’t enough to unseat Facebook in the App Store, regular, loyal Facebook users around the world have put momentum behind a #DeleteFacebook campaign — a novel act of online rebellion despite plenty of previous privacy scandals.","Some news events unexpectedly break through and take on new lives and trigger genuine, lasting movement. Moments like these are impossible to predict or control. The Parkland school shooting this February wasn’t an outlier in terms of casualties or sheer scale of horror and yet that particular tragedy’s aftermath was a breaking point and prompted a full-throated rejection of the status quo. The Parkland students were simply fed up. Fed up with the notion of not having control over their own safety. Fed up with a system in which victims of gun violence seemingly have no agency.","While the situations are drastically different, the frustration at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is similarly about agency and control. For years we’ve read about privacy scandals from the NSA’s Prism program to the data breaches everywhere from Equifax to Ashley Madison. We’re no stranger to the warnings that the platforms we live on harvest our data and that every detail of our online activities acts as the oil that powers the internet’s economic engine and that there’s little we can do, save for opting out completely. But this one lays bare the downsides of this tradeoff — how, despite their pledge to empower us, the platforms we live on have done just the opposite and stripped us of the agency to dictate what happens with our most personal information. Maybe it’s because Facebook feels so personal or because the 2016 election was so divisive, but this scandal is shaping up to be the event that forces the scales to fall from our eyes. We’ve lost control. And we’re fed up.","Every revolution needs to be ignited. Cambridge Analytica feels a lot like a spark.","If you want to read more about Facebook’s data scandal,subscribe to Infowarzel, a BuzzFeed News newsletter by the author of this piece, Charlie Warzel.","Charlie Warzel is a Senior Technology Writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in Missoula, Montana"],"isopubdate":""}

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)","(Newser)\n–\nA data analysis firm employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign tapped the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, allowing it to capitalize on the private social media activity of a large portion of the US electorate, reports the AP. One of the largest data leaks in Facebook history let Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Trump strategist Steve Bannon, to develop techniques that formed the basis of its work on the campaign, the New York Times and the Guardian reported. Facebook said it suspended Cambridge Analytica over allegations it kept the improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had been deleted. In a blog post, Facebook explained that Cambridge Analytica had years ago received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm was not authorized. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information, although Facebook received reports \"several days ago\" that not all data was deleted. Facebook has suspended Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, who created the app; and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who is a primary source for the Times report. Trump's campaign denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the RNC for its data. Cambridge Analytica is backed by billionaire donor Robert Mercer. The firm had wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence behavior, but lacked data to make its products work. It has surfaced in US probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica in August.","Among other things, a prior version of this story, no longer on the marquee but referred to at the top of the page, says, “Trump Consultant Behind Massive Facebook Data Leak”, intended to suggest that Bannon directly and personally engaged in invading Facebook and stealing information. Now, the article says, “Trump-Linked Firm Mined 50M Facebook Profiles”, and Bannon is indicated only “involved” to the extent of being a principal of Cambridge Analytica. And the information obtained was as the result of those directly questioned by Cambridge Analytica offered the names of friends. Cambridge Analytica obtained much information about the offered names, and not necessarily by illegally obtaining records that are supposed to be hidden. Obtaining information that way is not mentioned anywhere. And that isn't even part of the accusations against Cambridge Analytica, only their actions with respect to the disposing of the information. And note the suggestion, in prominent positions, that they didn't dispose of any of the information, with the reference further down in the article that they hadn't disposed of all of it, and no indication is given of how big or hot little the amount not disposed of was! Note, too, the information is described as “improperly” obtained the information, not illegally! Those who want to hate Trump, though, won't care. Also, many if not most other articles describe Facebook itself as saying it wasn't a “leak”, but Newser keeps on using the term. It's also mentioned that, in fact, despite the suggested eminent importance of the obtained data being destroyed, Facebook contacted Cambridge Analytica to eliminate it, but did not follow up on that for years.","The Equalizer","Mar 18, 2018 11:21 AM CDT","There ya go.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Eight years ago, CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave us a glimpse into just how important the early investment by Milner was for the growing company.","When Digital Sky Technologies, Milner’s tech company, acquired a $200 million stake in Facebook in 2009, the barely 25-year-old Zuckerberg told The Guardian about what he was planning to glean from the investment: ”These guys really have a unique profile, they are not the traditional investors that you get at a stage like this,” he said. “They have a lot of experience that they can bring.”","This was very specific experience: ”One of the things that was most interesting to me about DST’s portfolio is they have a large number of social networks and each of them monetizes in different ways and all of them effectively.”","The portfolio included Vkontakte, Russia’s copy-cat equivalent of Facebook, and several other social media platforms across 13 European countries. The networks were making money from online advertising, as well as micropayments, The Guardian reported in May 2009.","Milner told Tech Crunch at the time that his investment was “good business” and that he was comfortable with Facebook’s valuation of $10 billion because the company had “very unique perspective on social network monetization.” While investors then worried whether Facebook could be profitable, Milner had a unique perspective based on his social media investments in Russia. ”You see how social networks have been monetized in our part of the world, and we’re just doing our math and coming up with numbers that we feel very comfortable with going forward,” he said.","A month later, DST bought up to $100 million of shares from Facebook employees, and in 2011, Milner invested an additional $50 million into the Silicon Valley giant. Milner also founded a venture capital firm, DST Global, and his companies would eventually hold 8% of Facebook and 5% of Twitter. Milner and Zuckerberg became friends, according to The New York Times, and met monthly. The Russian billionaire sold off his holdings several years later. Facebook has grown rapidly since then, its quarterly revenue topping $10 billion for the first time according to its latest report.","The trove of documents revealed this weekend by various news organizations around the world, dubbed “The Paradise Papers,” suggest that the money for the early investment in Facebook came in part from state-backed Russian companies. Milner maintains that backing was purely economic, not political, in nature.","The New York Times reported that through shell companies, Milner’s DST venture firm received money from Gazprom Investholdings, a financial subsidiary of the Kremlin-backed energy giant Gazprom, which supplies much of Europe’s natural gas. The subsidiary’s director was Alisher Usmanov, an oligarch close to Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, also known to be Milner’s business associate.","Milner himself was dubbed by Wired in 2011 ”the most successful investor in social media.” In addition to Facebook and the Russian social platforms, he has also invested in Airbnb, Groupon, Spotify, and Zynga, as well as Chinese internet giant Alibaba. Milner graduated from Wharton business school in the US and originally trained in Russia as a physicist. Over the last several years he has put hundreds of millions of dollars into scientific endeavors, most notably the search for life outside of Earth."],"isopubdate":"2017-11-06"}

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board.","The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","Tony Romm contributed to this report.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,” Wylie told The Observer.","When Facebook found out about the leak in 2015 it failed to notify users, and then took until August 2016 before it sent a letter to CA demanding the company destroy all the data it obtained from the 50 million profiles.","Only it didn’t follow up on the directive, and the Times reporters claim to have had access to raw data from the breach.","“In 2012, Kosinski proved that on the basis of an average of 68 Facebook ‘likes’ by a user, it was possible to predict their skin colour (with 95% accuracy), their sexual orientation (88% accuracy), and their affiliation to the Democratic or Republican party (85%).","“But it didn’t stop there.

Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

{"originalurl":"https://wapo.st/2pIqCsV?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.b852f1aad357","title":"Facebook’s discussions with Congress signal Mark Zuckerberg will testify amid data-privacy scandal - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook has signaled that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress by discussing the details of the appearance with lawmakers, according to a person familiar with the conversations.","Three congressional committees have invited Zuckerberg to testify, including the Senate Judiciary Committee at an April 10 meeting about data privacy. It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

There appears to be a trend among newly-listed, mostly high-growth, firms to have these corporate governance structures that provide shareholders with weak rights when it comes to running the company. The dual class share structure, as in Facebook’s case, is only one of several measures to ensure that the founding member team remains in power.","As well as Facebook, companies that have established these sorts of governance mechanisms include Berkshire Hathaway, Expedia, FitBit, Ford, Google (Alphabet), GoPro, Hyatt Hotels, Snap, and Under Armour. The main defence of this governance measure, used by the founders or family heirs of these firms, is that it allows the companies to take a long-term view and make investment decisions that may not necessarily yield results in the short run.","But the recent Facebook scandal also highlights that these corporate governance mechanisms appear to make firms immune to calls for change, particularly if the leadership of the firm is affected.","Good vs bad governance","Shareholders are the main providers of capital for publicly listed companies.

There is no blueprint for good corporate governance as every firm is likely to have different needs, and these also change over the life cycle of the firm.","Yet, there is little a controversy about the fact that when there is little opportunity for existing shareholders or outside activist investors to influence things, managers and directors can become entrenched and make decisions that could harm the business – and therefore shareholders. And companies where the board of directors can make decisions without fear of being replaced have been labelled “dictatorship firms”.","Pros and cons of dictatorship","As it turns out, under certain conditions, dictatorship firms may actually perform well. Recent researchsuggests that in order to foster innovation, reward for long-term success and job security are important. The way that dictatorship firms are set up facilitates this.","Data also suggests that dictatorship firms can increase company value by allowing it to take a long-term view. Hence, shareholders provide capital to dictatorship firms by trusting the skills and vision of the founder and leadership team to identify, invest in, and manage projects that guarantee continual high future growth.","But dictatorship-style corporate governance can become problematic in three scenarios. First, when growth and innovation slow down. This contradicts one of the main arguments in favour of dictatorship firms – that their long-term focus fosters innovation and that this is associated with high growth. But when growth does slow down, the firm will have fewer investment opportunities.","Plus, lower spending tends to mean higher future cash holdings and academic evidence suggests that as companies accumulate more cash, they tend to make worse investment decisions. Hence, in those firms, it becomes more important to monitor how capital is spent and to consider paying out more to shareholders.","A second problematic situation for dictatorship firms is how to handle succession – something Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has spoken of. As Musk puts it: the dual class structure can be taken to an extreme “where one class basically doesn’t count”. That’s the public shareholders. And, although possible, it is rare that the children of the founders are the right people to continue running the firm (which is a common line of succession in a dictatorship firm). Hence, there needs to be a path towards a single share class so that control is not passed on via dictatorship.","The third problematic scenario for dictatorship firms is when a dramatic change in the course of action of the company is required – particularly in response to scandals. Since 2010, Facebook has had ten sets of legal issues (excluding the Cambridge Analytica scandal). In a company with strong shareholder rights, it is likely that a change in the executive leadership team would have happened by now.","Not all hope for better corporate governance is lost, however. The ride-hailing app company Uber provides an example of how change can still happen, despite having an entrenched leadership team. After several scandals emerged at the end of 2017, its board made former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick step down and revoked his super-voting rights, creating equal voting power among shareholders. Facebook is yet to make similar moves but it would create a more democratic governance structure if it did so."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out.","| Global Capital – IPO Tikehau Capital, the French alternative investment manager, has committed a €250m order for the IPO of DWS Group and has initiated discussions on potential cooperation between the two firms, including on alternative asset management distribution.

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"","\"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\"","The Guardian reported Sunday that at 17, Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the opposition, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion.","A senior source with the Liberal party says Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission.","Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modelling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","\"This was a scam — and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used.\"","In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\" Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\"","Reading voters' minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Nix, a brash salesperson, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behaviour and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win.","When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email.","\"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote.","Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behaviour.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","An international effort","Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \"personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\" Nix \"never had any strategic or operational role\" in a U.S. election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company's U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees' roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","After the leak","By early 2015, Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favoured.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Wylie and other former \"contractors\" as engaging in \"what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \"carefully investigating this situation\" and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \"This data was obtained and used without permission,\" said a letter that was obtained by The New York Times. \"It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\"","Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Kogan and \"SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\"","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook's control. The New York Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The New York Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica's political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump's re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a \"Math Man,\" he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on.","Cambridge Analytica used personality quiz app to harvest social media data from over 50 million users, most without consent.","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 U.S. midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K.

But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used.\"","In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\" Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\"","Reading voters' minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Nix, a brash salesperson, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behaviour and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win.","When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email.","\"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote.","Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behaviour.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","An international effort","Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \"personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\" Nix \"never had any strategic or operational role\" in a U.S. election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company's U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees' roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","After the leak","By early 2015, Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favoured.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Wylie and other former \"contractors\" as engaging in \"what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \"carefully investigating this situation\" and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \"This data was obtained and used without permission,\" said a letter that was obtained by The New York Times. \"It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\"","Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Kogan and \"SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\"","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook's control. The New York Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The New York Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica's political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump's re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a \"Math Man,\" he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on.","Cambridge Analytica used personality quiz app to harvest social media data from over 50 million users, most without consent.","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 U.S. midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"","\"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\"","The Guardian reported Sunday that at 17, Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the opposition, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion.","A senior source with the Liberal party says Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission.","Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modelling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","\"This was a scam — and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday.

That means that around 300,000 people could sign up for a personality test quiz, and in the process hand over information of 150 times that number.","Now, however, Facebook apps are only allowed to gather information from users who have directly signed up for them, greatly limiting their reach. That change was made in 2014, and rolled out to every Facebook app over the course of 2015.","But it’s still the case that apps which you have directly enabled can harvest a significant amount of data from your account – often information which you might be surprised to know you’re handing over.","The app settings page on Facebook is the place to manage the apps you’ve given access to. Clicking on the link will bring up a list of apps under “logged in with Facebook”. Hopefully you’ll recognise most of them – if there’s any you don’t, consider clicking the “X”, deauthorising them from your account.","No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","Read more","You might also want to click on the edit button under the “apps others use” heading lower down the page. This takes you to your privacy settings for the modern version of the same feature Cambridge Analytica profited from. The information others can hand over on your behalf is limited, but still includes data such as your date of birth, religious and political views, and activities, interests and things you like. Consider unchecking all the boxes. According to Facebook, leaving them all checked will make your friends’ “experience better and more social”, which doesn’t seem like a good trade-off for you.","If that’s not enough for you to feel safe, maybe now’s the time to delete your Facebook account altogether.","That’s somewhat harder to do. If you go through the account settings, Facebook will attempt to push you to “deactivate” your account, which “will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook”. Notably, it won’t remove any of your data from Facebook’s servers, and your account lies dormant hoping you will change your mind.","If you actually want to delete your information from Facebook, the real setting is hidden in a help document with the title “how do I permanently delete my account?” Clicking on “let us know” on that page will take users to the real account deletion screen.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)","The news that Facebook's Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant. But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place?","The short answer: Because Google let it. The longer answer: Well, it's complicated.","The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 — first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn't collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings.","Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics. The kerfuffle over this data collection, first reported by the website Ars Technica , follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence election.","There's a reason Facebook's actions were restricted to Android phones. Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. \"Apple's fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,\" said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.","But Android has long been more indulgent.","Until recently, in fact, Google let app developers gain access to a phone's call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.","Starting in 2012 with its \"Jelly Bean\" release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs, but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn't work.","It wasn't until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed \"Marshmallow,\" that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.","That's the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren't using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can't get it even if they want it.","Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.","There are nearly 20,000 different Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.","As of January, about 65 per cent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 per cent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as \"Oreo.\" (Many of them are owners of Google's new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)","Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.","All that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?","Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google's advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.","Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple's App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did.","Experts say it's not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it's very possible.","\"In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. \"There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.\"","A Google spokesperson was unable to say how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users' call logs had been sent to app developers. The company declined to comment further.","The role of manufacturers of Android phones for protecting user privacy remains unclear, South Korean mobile device maker LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.","\"Privacy is everyone's responsibility — software providers, carriers, as well as device manufacturers,\" said LG, whose smartphones run on the Android operating system.","\"At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,\" it said. \"If hardware played a role in the breach then we will certainly look into solution options.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The FTC, in a statement on Monday, confirmed that it has an \"open non-public investigation\" into Facebook's privacy practices.","Pahl said the FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers.","\"Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honour their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act,\" the statement said.","\"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" it said.","In a related development, attorney generals of as many as 37 states on Monday sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling for answers to reports that millions of Facebook users personal data was provided to third parties without their knowledge or informed consent.","In the letter, the attorney generals demand to know about Facebook's role in the manipulation of users data by Cambridge Analytica —without those users' knowledge — as well as Facebook's policies and procedures for protecting users private data.","The letter requests that Facebook produce information regarding their business practices and safeguards to protect users' privacy.","Signatories to the letter, among others, includes New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S Grewal. Early reports indicate that user data of at least 50 million Facebook profiles may have been misused and misappropriated by third-party software developers, the letter said.","\"According to these reports, Facebook's previous policies allowed developers to access the personal data of \"friends\" of people who used applications on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those \"friends\",\" the attorney generals said. It has also been reported that while providing other developers access to personal Facebook user data, Facebook took as much as 30 per cent of payments made through the developers' applications by Facebook users, they said.","\"Facebook apparently contends that this incident of harvesting tens of millions of profiles was not the result of a technical data breach; however, the reports allege that Facebook allowed third parties to obtain personal data of users who never authorised it, and relied on terms of service and settings that were confusing and perhaps misleading to its users,\" the letter said.","These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook's policies and practices, and the processes in place to ensure they are followed, they said.

As observers increasingly talk of big tech legislation from U.S. lawmakers, shares in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are also down.","Facebook is in trouble over its data handling. A few years ago, Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge in the UK, created a personality survey in which around 270,000 Facebook users took part. However, by completing the survey, users had to agree that Facebook could pass on their data – as well as their friends’ data – to Kogan. This was all in accordance with Facebook’s privacy guidelines at the time. The problem is that this data was then acquired by data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. This meant that 50 million users’ personal data was now in the hands of a third party without their explicit consent, and Facebook had no idea what was happening with it.","Enter Your E-mail Address To Subscribe","* indicates required","Email Address *","In fairness, Facebook’s terms prohibited Kogan to share the user data with Cambridge Analytica. The problem is what happened after he did it anyway; nothing. When Facebook learned of the data breach, it ended Kogan’s access to the user data, and then asked Cambridge Analytica to pretty-please delete the data that they illegitimately acquired. Cambridge Analytica then said ‘yes’, and promptly proceeded not to do so. On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was this data that allowed Cambridge Analytica to provide Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign with information for targeted political marketing, thus helping him achieve office.","In addition, lawmakers are critical of the fact that Facebook kept schtum about the data leak when it was discovered, failing to alert users that their information was being used without their consent.","According to The Street, Facebook denies the accusation of a data breach in relation to Kogan’s survey, stating that: “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive information were stolen or hacked.”","Twitter shares are down -1.63% to $35.00 USD at the time of writing, while Alphabet shares are down -3.76% to $1,093.00 USD.

The company harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without permission, the New York Times reported.","It was a punishing day for other tech billionaires too. Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos lost $2.1 billion (all figures US) and the fortunes of Alphabet Inc. founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin each declined $1.5 billion as a technology selloff sent the Nasdaq indexes to the steepest losses in six weeks.","Facebook shares fell 6.8 per cent to $172.56, cutting Zuckerberg’s fortune to $70.4 billion and dropping him one place to fifth on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s now behind Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega.","Facebook investors were making themselves heard, sending the stock to its biggest intra-day sell-off since September 2012. Lots of other people aired their grievances via Twitter.","A Bloomberg count of negative sentiment expressed on Twitter hit its highest level since Feb. 2, 2017, following reports that a political advertising firm retained information on millions of Facebook users without their consent. Tweet sentiment is measured by Bloomberg using proprietary analytics. It’s the fourth most negative day in the last four years for Facebook, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.","Despite all the political noise, it’s hard to see potential regulation seriously damaging the company’s dominance in online advertising, several analysts said.","“This is more ‘headline risk’ at this point and does not overly concern us,” Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said in a note to clients. Ives maintained his buy rating on Facebook shares, saying any stock weakness related to “regulatory and political headline risk” could be an opportunity.","The Cambridge Analytica breach is the latest in a procession of controversies for the internet giant. Zuckerberg has pledged to “fix” the platform after revelations last year that Russian agents used it to try to influence the 2016 presidential election. There’s also a growing backlash among pundits and journalists suggesting Facebook divides people rather than accomplishing its original mission of bringing the world together. Politicians in the U.K. and U.S. have called for enhanced regulations and transparency, especially when it comes to political ads on the site.","The core value of Facebook is the trove of highly specific information it has on each of its users, which number 1.37 billion worldwide. It’s possible the site will become a less appealing place for advertisers if politicians enact strict rules on how that data can be used, Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at research firm EMarketer, said in an email.","“This specific incident is not likely to cause advertisers to leave Facebook, but it will cause them to think twice about how data about Facebook’s users is handled,” Aho Williamson said. “If Facebook were forced to change the way it uses data or the way its ad products work, then advertisers may become less enamoured with it.”","Still, when it comes to digital advertising, Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have a lock on the market. Together, the two companies accounted for 58.5 per cent of the U.S. market in 2017, according to EMarketer. That means advertisers have little choice but to spend on Facebook if they want to get their message out to the widest audience online.","“Facebook and Google still very much enjoy an advertising duopoly, and although engagement is arguably at risk, there are no real alternatives of scale,” James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt and Co., wrote in a note. “This is an unintended, yet unavoidable, byproduct of operating a platform with 30 per cent of the global population.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The independent pro-Trump journalist Sara Carterposted a story charging that Mueller, as a federal prosecutor in Boston in the mid-1980s, had covered up the FBI’s dealings with the Mafia informant Whitey Bulger. Carter was soon discussing her findings in prime time with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Meanwhile, Trump supporters on Twitter circulated video of testimony Mueller gave to Congress ahead of the 2003 Iraq War in which he endorsed the view, later proven false, that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.” POLITICO notes, “To some, the barrage looked coordinated among pro-Trump allies and media outlets, a concerted effortto tarnish Mueller’s reputation as part of a political strategy to undermine, or even eventually fire, the Russia investigator.”","Voice of America reports, “The top U.S. defense official chastised Russia for dangerous and reckless behavior, saying it was ‘pretty obvious’ Moscow was behind the use of a military-grade nerve agent against a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain. ‘Attempted murder of a man and his daughter. How’s that for starters?’ U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters Tuesday at the Pentagon when asked to describe the incident that has since touched off a diplomatic backlash against Russia.” Voice of America adds, “U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who said he was involved in the decision-making process that led to the expulsions, placed the blame on Russia, saying Moscow’s decisions have left the West with little choice.” Meanwhile Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty adds, “NATO has joined more than two dozen governments around the world in expelling Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in Britain.” Note: this is who answers for the West now.","The Washington Post reports, “The FBI on Tuesday announced it was doubling the number of staffers working on preparing documents requested by the House Judiciary Committee chairman, who last week issued a subpoena to the Justice Department as part of his effort to gather more information on some of the agency’s most high-profile controversies. In a statement, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said the bureau would double, from 27 to 54, the number of staffers working on fulfilling requests from Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).” The Washington Post adds, “The Judiciary Committee chairman is seeking a bevy of materials on the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the investigation into former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and the role a controversial dossier played in helping the FBI obtain a warrant to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.” None of this bodes well for a free and democratic future, Trumpistan. Given what we are facing, this is quite the use of manpower but who cares? Nothing matters! Sovereignty was something for our parents and grandparents, not for us.","Reuters reports, “The White House is investigating whether two loans totaling more than $500 million to the family real estate business of U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner violated any criminal laws or regulations, according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.” Reuters adds, “In a letter to a congressman made public on Monday, David Apol, acting director and general counsel of the Office of Government Ethics, said, ‘I have discussed this matter with the White House Counsel’s Office in order to ensure that they have begun the process of ascertaining the facts necessary to determine whether any law or regulation has been violated.’” The loans in question are from Citigroup Inc. and private equity firm Apollo Global Management.","Reuters reports, “Saudi Arabia and Russia are working on a historic long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering a deal to greatly extend a short-term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices.” Reuters notes, “A long-term pact between Moscow and Riyadh would effectively co-opt Russia to the Saudi-led OPEC cartel while strengthening Russia’s hand in the Middle East where the United States has long been the dominant super-power. News of the potential oil alliance came at a time when the two have been working to cement an economic relationship despite being at odds over the conflict in Syria, where they back opposing sides.” Reuters adds, “A meeting between the Saudi crown prince and Russian president Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in China in September 2016 was instrumental in bringing Russia on board to support OPEC, non-OPEC oil curbs. Last October, Saudi King Salman became the first Saudi monarch to visit Russia”.","CHECK PLEASE\nCBS News reports, “The National Rifle Association accepts foreign contributions, it told the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee in a recent letter, but the gun rights group insists none of it goes towards elections and is all raised and spent ‘within the bounds of the law.’” CBS News notes, “The NRA is under pressure after the Parkland shooting and its response to it. A recent McClatchy report also claimed the FBI had looked into whether a Russian banker funneled funds to the NRA to help Donald Trump’s campaign.” CBS News adds, “IRS records reviewed by CBS News show that the NRA answered ‘yes’ to the question, ‘Did the organization have aggregate revenues or expenses of more than $10,000 from grant-making, fundraising, business, investment, and program service activities outside the U.S., or aggregate foreign investmentsvalued at $100,000 or more?’ on its 2016 forms.” CBS News adds, “The NRA also answered questions about a 2015 Moscow visit taken by several NRA associates, and any fundraising actions involving Russians. Frazer defended the visit, claiming that a NRA member on the trip, Joe Gregory, has only honorary titles within the organization, and travelled to Russia in his ‘personal capacity.’ The NRA general counsel also claimed no Russian nationals were ever members of NRA’s Golden Ring of Freedom, a designation reserved for top donors.” According to CBS News Senator “Wyden, however, did not find all those answers satisfactory,” and, “fired off a letter to Frazer on Tuesday in response.” CBS News notes, “In his letter, Wyden demanded further information on foreign NRA funding that has occurred over the last three years. Wyden also asked if any Russian national had ever been a member of any NRA donor program.”","ABC News reports Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher “Wylie appeared before British parliament to discuss his role as a former employee of the data firm Cambridge Analytica. Wylie became a central figure in the scandal involving the data firm last week when he told the U.K.’s Observer newspaper and the New York Times that Cambridge Analytica allegedly used personal information of up to 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge through a third-party quiz app. Wylie, who left the company in 2014, said that he was concerned about the data’s possible misuse in the 2016 US election and that it might have been used to target specific voters with campaign ads.” Reuters adds Wylie also testified “on Tuesday that Canadian company AggregateIQ worked on software called Ripon which was used to identify Republican voters ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.” The Washington Postpublished the Ripon brochure in full so go have a look at the once secret marketing and enjoy the sunlight. Most jarringly, however, Business Insider reports, “The whistleblower at the centre of the Cambridge Analytica scandal said he was told his predecessor was murdered in a Kenyan hotel room and that police were bribed not to investigate.” Business Insider adds, “Wylie said his predecessor, Dan Muresan, was poisoned after ‘a deal went sour.’”","Fast Company reports, “while Facebook provided the original data, it wasn’t the only vehicle for Kogan’s app. Kogan acquired what he wanted from individual people—over 240,000 over a six-month period—recruiting them and paying them for their quiz answers and data using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk micro-work platform and Qualtrics, a survey platform.” Fast Company notes, “The two platforms are often used by companies to conduct experiments and surveys and by academic researchers to, for instance, recruit psychology subjects. Research ethics require that scientists only gather people’s data for specified uses with their explicit consent, and Amazon’s polices prohibit tasks from harvesting people’s Facebook data.” Fast Company adds, “At the time, multiple survey-takers took to a message board, Turkopticon, to report the quiz for violating of Amazon’s Terms of Service. The company eventually booted Kogan from its platform in 2015–over a year later–after learning from a Guardian article that he had passed the data to Cambridge Analytica. But Kogan’s new company, Philometrics, continues to post questionnaires to Mechanical Turk, according to Turkopticon. Kogan’s collaborator on the Cambridge Analytica project, Joe Chancellor, also still uses the platform; according to one review website, he posted a task on Mechanical Turk in February.” Fast Company notes, “in February 2014 and again in May 2014, a flurry of negative reviews reported that Kogan had violated the Amazon Turk Terms of Service.”","The New York Times reports, “As a start-up called Cambridge Analytica sought to harvest the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans in summer 2014, the company received help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies, a top Silicon Valley contractor to American spy agencies and the Pentagon.” The New York Times adds, “It was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge’s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app — a mobile-phone-based personality quiz — to gain access to Facebook users’ friend networks”. The New York Times notes, “The revelations pulled Palantir — co-founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel — into the furor surrounding Cambridge, which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016. Mr. Thiel, a supporter of President Trump, serves on the board at Facebook.” The New York Times adds, “The Palantir employee, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, works on business development for the company, according to his LinkedIn page. In an initial statement, Palantir said it had ‘never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica, nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.’ Later on Tuesday, Palantir revised its account, saying that Mr. Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company’s behalf when he advised Mr. Wylie on the Facebook data.” Additionally, “A former intern at SCL — Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Eric Schmidt, then Google’s executive chairman — urged the company to link up with Palantir, according to Mr. Wylie’s testimony and a June 2013 email”.","Russian state-run RT reports, “Germany has issued a permit for the construction and operation of an offshore section of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Germany in the Baltic Sea.” Russian state-run RT notes, “The project has been strongly opposed by several members of the European Union, including Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Hungary, as well as Ukraine,” adding, “the US has threatened to sanction companies that cooperate with Russia to implement the project.” Oh joy! If this pipeline is built wave bye-bye to European security.","The AP reports, “A court in southern Russia has ruled to uphold an injunction to block an online investigation featuring a woman who has boasted of her relationship with a Russian oligarch. The video posted in February by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny drew from the social media account of Anastasia Vashukevich, a Belarusian woman who claimed to have had an affair with billionaire tycoon Oleg Deripaska.” Vashukevich is also known by the name Nastya Rybka.","CNN reports, “The special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election revealed Tuesday night that prosecutors say they have connected former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates to a person with ties to a Russian intelligence service while Gates worked on the campaign. That Gates and the unnamed person, who had lived in Kiev and Moscow and worked for one of Paul Manafort’s companies, were in touch in September and October 2016 was ‘pertinent to the investigation,’ a court filing from prosecutors said Tuesday night.” CNN adds, “The acknowledgment that Gates knew the person had Russian intelligence ties is alleged in a report prosecutors filed about the coming sentencing of a Dutch attorney. That attorney, Alex van der Zwaan, who worked with Gates and Manafort previously, pleaded guilty last month to lying to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators about his interactions with Gates and the unnamed person.” Van der Zwaan is also the son-in-law of Russian oligarch German Khan.","Axios reports, “Paul Manafort’s legal team has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, filed in Virginia, brought against him by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which includes three charges for tax fraud from 2010 to 2014, failing to file reports from his foreign bank accounts, and bank fraud related to various property loans in the U.S.” Axios adds, “This followsa nearly identical motion to dismiss his team filed on March 14, which dealt with the charges brought against him in D.C.”","CNN reports, “American opinions on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election appears hardened and driven by partisanship, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS after a month rife with developments in the ongoing probe.” CNN adds, “Overall, 6 in 10 say they see the investigation as a serious matter that should be fully investigated (58% say so), while around a third (36%) say it’s mainly an effort to discredit Donald Trump’s presidency.”","CNBC reports, “The lawyer for adult entertainment star Stormy Daniels has filed a motion in a California court seeking to force President Donald Trump, and his lawyer Michael Cohen, to testify under oath.” CNBC adds, “Michael Avenatti, has requested a deposition of ‘no greater than two hours’ of the president. The main aim is to ask Trump if he knew about the payment.”","BuzzFeed reports, “The FBI possessesa secret report asserting that Vladimir Putin’s former media czar was beaten to death by hired thugs in Washington, DC— directly contradicting the US government’s official finding that Mikhail Lesin died by accident.” The report on Lesin’s death “was written by the former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele,” also the author of the dossier on Trump. BuzzFeed notes, “The bureau received his report while it was helping the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department investigate the Russian media baron’s death.” In his report, Steele wrote, “that Lesin was bludgeoned to death by enforcers working for an oligarch close to Putin,” and, “The thugs had been instructed to beat Lesin, not kill him, but they went too far”. Additionally, “the report described the killers as Russian state security agents moonlighting for the oligarch.”","USA Today reports, “The Commerce Department is reinstating a citizenship question to the 2020 Census for the first time in decades, a move that some argue willlead to an undercount of minorities living in the United States.” USA Today notes, “The U.S. Census Bureau counts the total number of people in the country — not the total number of citizens — every 10 years. Though it usually doesn’t ask about a person’s citizenship status, the Justice Department asked the agency late last year to include the question. It is the first time the government has done that in 70 years.” USA Today adds, “The Census count is used to redraw congressional districts, so it can affect the makeup of Congress, and to determine where federal, state and local funds will be used to build new schools, roads, health care facilities, child-care centers and senior centers. It also forms the basis of countless government and academic studies that drive public policy decisions,” so not counting people will affect a range of social and political services. While the government is using the Voting Rights Act as an excuse to make the changes, USA Today adds, “Former attorney general Eric Holder, now with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Tuesday morning that he would sue the administration to block the question from the Census. He said asking about citizenship has nothing to do with voting rights.” He’s right. The New York Times adds, “At least 12 states signaled Tuesday that they would sue to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, arguing that the change would cause fewer Americans to be counted and violate the Constitution. The New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said he was leading a multistate lawsuit to stop the move, and officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington said they would join the effort. The State of California filed a separate lawsuit late Monday night.”","The Daily Mail reports, “Megyn Kelly has waded into the Stormy Daniels-Donald Trump saga by claiming she too was threatened by the President’s people.” The Daily Mail recalls, “Appearing on 60 Minutes Sunday, former porn star Daniels said she was threatened and told to ‘leave Trump alone’ after she claimed to have had an affair with him back in 2006.” Kelly said in her book and on Twitter that the threats in her case came directly from then campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Patterns of behavior.","CNN reports, “The brother of Seth Rich, the slain Democratic National Committee staffer whose unsolved murder became the basis for conspiracy theories on the far-right, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against individuals and media organizations that he alleges peddled false and unfounded claims about him.” CNN adds, “The lawsuit, filed by Aaron Rich in US District Court in the District of Columbia, accuses Ed Butowsky, a wealthy Texas businessman; Matt Couch, a fringe internet activist; America First Media, Couch’s media company; and The Washington Times, a conservative newspaper, of acting ‘with reckless disregard for the truth.’” CNN recalls, “Seth Rich was fatally shot in Washington, DC, in July 2016. Police have said evidence indicates he was the victim of a botched robbery, but in the wake of his death, far-right activists and media organizations suggested something far more sinister. Without real evidence, they peddled a conspiracy theory that said Seth Rich leaked a trove of DNC emails to Wikileaks and was killed in retribution for the supposed leak. The theory was convenient for some on the right as they disputed allegations Russia hacked the DNC”. CNN notes, “The suit alleges those people and media companies pushed a conspiracy theory about Aaron Rich that used his background as a defense contractor with technical expertise to suggest he worked with his brother to leak DNC documents to Wikileaks, received money for doing so, and then worked to cover-up the crime.” CNN adds, “Aaron Rich’s lawsuit comes just weeks after the parents of Seth Rich sued Fox News and Butowsky for their role in peddling the Seth Rich conspiracy theory.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Most of these people were unemployed rust belt workers, who hadn’t voted for anyone in the last 20 years, many were not even in possession of a computer let alone a broadband account and a Facebook account.","What we are being led to believe is that 2 million of these people, if they didn’t have access to computers all had smartphones or tablets and that each of them had enough data on Facebook that could be scraped and then analysed so that Steve Bannon and his minions could then use it to get all 2 million of these people to vote at all and then having made the decision to do so, to vote for Trump.","I would want to see a full evidential trail, with evidence of smartphone ownership and up to date Facebook Profile membership before believing any of that.","Prior to this latest revelation, published by the Observer, we were told that Donald Trump was put into the White House by Vladimir Putin and his cyber warriors working in “Troll factories” and creating fake news. No proof has emerged on that front either, even though it is over a year later, supposedly with probes into Trump’s son, his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner going on in the background.","No properly constituted Western court would ever convict someone on this nonexistent evidence and the Observer’s finger pointing does not stand up on the balance of probabilities either.","One response","Good Heavens, the evidence IS piling up! Especially about Russian meddling in the US elections (and not only about Trump). And poor people – even in Africa ! – function with smartphones and access to Internet.","So there’s nothing remarkable about Analytica scraping useful info for the Trump campaign. They do this normally for newspapers to help them zero in on the news items that are likely to attract a lot of readers. Incidentally, if I may be allowed to digress, such papers, as a result of the research, do not publish stuff that won’t get them traffic, even if it’s part of the news and would be honest reporting – the system is widely used by extreme right/alt right press and goes a long way to explain the systematic bias of populist papers, away from the truth and towards fake news that stir emotions!","This Gelmini piece is so naive.

said a new privacy shortcuts menu will allow users to quickly increase account security, manage who can see their information and activity on the site, and control advertisements they see.","Facebook's terms of service and data policy are being updated to improve transparency about how the site collects and uses information, according to Beringer and Egan.","The social network said it is also shutting down 'Partner Categories,' a feature which enables more precise targeting of ads by combining information from Facebook with data aggregated by outside companies such as Experian and Acxiom.","The app was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up their friends' data without consent -- as was possible under Facebook's rules at the time.","Lukewarm praise","Yet some

We hope you understand, and consider subscribing for unlimited online access.","How to manipulate Facebook and Twitter instead of letting them manipulate you","Twitter and Facebook have vast control over our online lives. Here are six ways to take it back.","Billions of us count on social networks to help us keep in touch with friends and family, to get the latest news, and to share silly memes. But as we’re increasingly learning, this connectivity comes at a price: what you don’t pay in up-front costs is exacted in reams of personal data that might not always be used in ways you like.","On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform after the data-mining company was revealed to have gotten its hands on data from millions of users that it shouldn’t have had access to—data that it used to benefit President Trump’s 2016 campaign. That was just the latest in a string of manipulative moves made by the largest social network on the planet (with over two billion users every month, it’s bigger than many organized religions).","So what can you do if you feel the social networks are taking advantage of you? Fight back, of course. Here are some ways to do that right now.","Fight algorithms with algorithms","Algorithms on Facebook and Twitter control so much of what you see in your feed—they’re the reason, for instance, that you always seem to see posts from your best friend but not those from an old roommate you don’t interact with very much online. Or, more insidiously, why you see news only from certain sources and not from others.","You can mess with these algorithms by using a tool like Gobo, a project from researchers at the MIT Media Lab’s Center for Civic Media. Gobo connects with your Twitter and Facebook accounts and lets you precisely control your feeds in a way that the companies themselves won’t. Sliders let you adjust factors like how serious or silly the stories in your news feed are, what percentage of posts you see are from men or women, or the amount of political diversity you’re exposed to. The tool also lets you see what it removed from your feed and why.","Later, feeds","What if you’d rather just not deal with feeds at all? Try using something like Feedless, an iPhone app that blocks much of the content in Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter feeds on the iOS Safari browser (it’s free for Facebook, though you’ll have to pay $10 per year to use it to block feeds from the other two).","Once you enable it for Facebook, you will still be able to see your full profile and notifications, as well as any posts that those notifications are related to. You can also post status updates. But your news feed—that ever-present, algorithmically driven river of stuff—simply disappears.","Go niche","It’s nearly impossible for new worldwide social networks to make a dent in the market because it’s just so hard to move everyone away from the networks we’re already using.","But there are a lot of other online communities to join, many of them devoted to specific interests.","Are you into books? Try Litsy. Obsessed with design and showing off what you’re working on? Perhaps Dribbble will do it for you. Want to connect anonymously with others who work at your company so you can dish honestly about what’s going on there? Check out Blind.","Not today, advertisers","Ever wonder what kinds of data about you Twitter and Facebook share with advertisers? On Twitter, at least, it’s not that hard to figure out how ads are targeted and either change the targeting or make it impossible to target you, period.","If you click on “Your Twitter Data,” you can enter your password and see all kinds of information about yourself that the social network has collected, including a list called “Interests from Advertisers” that shows all the things those advertisers think you like. (Mine includes everything from dog treats—weird, since I don’t have a dog—to specific brands like Kleenex.)","Some of the many things Twitter advertisers think I like, including dog treats (not so much) and yogurt (absolutely).","Twitter","You can disable specific items on this list by un-checking them individually, or simply turn off ad personalization altogether. To get to that option, scroll to the bottom of the list and click “Personalization and Data Settings.”","You can see and manage similar information on Facebook, too. Under “Settings,” click “Ads” to view a slew of data the social network has collected about you and shares with advertisers. Tap “Your Interests” to uncheck individual interests Facebook is using to target ads to you in all kinds of categories (everything from “Interior Design” to “Food Allergy”), or tap “Your Categories” to remove categories advertisers are lumping you into (like “Technology Early Adopters” or “Frequent Travelers”).","The nuclear option","If you’re really, truly sick of Facebook and Twitter, you can take more drastic steps, up to and including deleting your accounts—though the networks make it annoyingly difficult to do.","On Twitter, if you’re using a Web browser, click your user profile image in the upper-right part of the page, and tap “Settings and Privacy.” Once in there, tap “Account” and scroll down to the bottom of the page, where there’s a “Deactivate Your Account” link. Keep in mind that while deactivating will remove your account from Twitter, killing it off actually takes some time; regular Twitter accounts are deleted a month after deactivation, while verified accounts are deleted a year afterwards.","Tristan Harris thinks big tech is taking advantage of us all. Can its power be used for good?","On Facebook, your options are more nuanced—and confusing. From a Web browser, you can tap the little downward-pointing arrow all the way to the right at the top of the page and click “Settings” from the drop-down menu. Under “General Account Settings,” click the “Manage Account” option. This brings up several options, including one to deactivate your account—which means you’re not deleting your account but basically putting it on hold and removing much of your personal data.","Ready to get Facebook out of your life permanently? This link should help you start the process, but it will actually take up to three months to scrub all your information from the system.","If you want to keep your Facebook account around for now but make it disappear after you shuffle off this mortal coil, there’s a way to do that, too. Click “Request Account Deletion” to ask Facebook to do it in the future.","One more tip: before you go, you can also download a copy of all your Facebook data. That option should also show up below the list of general account settings. On Twitter, you can request your archive from within the “Account” tab in the user settings.","Make your own network","This might sound kind of radical, but you can make your own social network and invite your friends to join.","I tried this out quickly via a startup called Mighty Networks, cofounded by Gina Bianchini, who previously created the DIY social-network company Ning.

We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","Part of the investigation will be to see if they violated Privacy Shield, a compliance program across the US and Europe for handling user privacy and data. It’s possible that an investigation could lead to enforcement action and fines for Facebook. A representative for FTC told BuzzFeed News the agency had no additional comment on the investigation.","This isn’t the first time Facebook has been dinged by the FTC over user privacy. In 2011, Facebook and the FTC reached a settlement over charges that it deceived its users in a variety of ways, including: sharing posts that were marked “Friends Only” with third-party apps, storing data after users deleted their accounts, and sharing user data with advertisers after promising it wouldn’t. As part of the settlement, Facebook had to agree to several measures of transparency about user privacy, including \"giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings,\" preventing anyone from accessing data from deleted accounts, and getting a third-party privacy checkup every two years.","The user data taken by a researcher through a quiz app that was later sold to Cambridge Analytica happened in 2014, years after the FTC settlement. \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" according to a statement in Monday's FTC release.","Here is the full statement by Tom Pahl, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection:","The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers. Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices."],"isopubdate":""}

The article calls out CEO Mark Zuckerberg and notes how odd it is that while his company monitors billions of people and encourages them to purchase certain things or perform certain interactions, Zuckerberg is invited to speak at Harvard without skepticism.","The revelation that Cambridge Analytica exploited the data of 50 million Facebook profiles to target American voters is indeed frightening. But Cambridge Analytica shouldn’t act as a diversion from the real bad guy in this story: Facebook. It is mystifying that as his company regulates the flow of information to billions of human beings, encouraging certain purchasing habits and opinions, and monitoring people’s interactions, Mark Zuckerberg is invited to give lectures at Harvard without being treated with due scepticism.","We have now reached the point where an unaccountable private corporation is holding detailed data on over a quarter of the world’s population. Zuckerberg and his company have been avoiding responsibility for some time. Governments everywhere need to get serious in how they deal with Facebook.","The op-ed further notes how publishers are left at the mercy of Facebook’s algorithm which can change at any moment, and a recent change to the site’s News Feed focusing on posts from family and friends was blamed for decreased interactions amongst a number of publishers. One publisher, LittleThings, directly blamed this change for their company shutting down.","Facebook wasn’t the only contributor to LittleThings’ demise, but those working at the website said there was nowhere else to go after the algorithm change. And this isn’t the only example: in 2013 an algorithm change halved the traffic of viral content website Upworthy – something from which the website has never recovered.","The impact of Facebook’s dominance means that publications are constantly scrambling to keep up with the platform’s changing strategy. The editor-in-chief of Wired, Nick Thompson, recently told the Digiday podcast that there was a fear“Facebook has a dial somewhere that can be turned to cut off media that gets too uppity”.","The Guardian notes that Facebook has used a number of manipulative practices to track users data:","Even if we want to avoid the site and keep our data protected, it’s not as easy as one might think. According to Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, the company uses techniques found in propaganda and casino gambling to foster psychological addiction in its users – such as constant notifications and variable rewards. By keeping us hooked, Facebook is able to hold a huge amount of data on us. What is surprising, and worrying, is the derived data Facebook has – the profiles it can build of its users based on seemingly innocuous information. The author of the book Networks of Control, Wolfie Christl, noted that a patent published by Facebook works out people’s commute times by using location data from mobile apps. It then uses this and other data to segregate users into social classes.","Facebook’s massive data cache goes hand in hand with its acquisition of competitors. Nick Srnicek, author of Platform Capitalism, says, “Facebook is acting like a classic monopoly: it’s buying up competitors like Instagram, it’s blatantly copying rivals like Snapchat, and it even has its own app, Onavo, that acts to warn them of potential threats. All of this is combined with an unchecked sweeping up of our data that’s being used to build an impervious moat around its business.”","The op-ed finishes by calling for regulation of Facebook like many other multinational companies rather than treating it as just another social media website:","If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence. So perhaps it’s time to start treating Facebook as the giant multinational corporation it is – especially because people with Facebook profiles aren’t the company’s customers: they are the product it sells to advertisers.","Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

(Image: Sinclair Broadcast Group)","WASHINGTON (SBG) —","A number of Facebook users are changing their status with the social media giant from \"It's Complicated\" to \"Separated\" after learning the company mishandled user data and shared it with third-party developers.","For any public company, trust is its currency. The latest revelations of a massive user privacy breach at Facebook have raised new questions about whether the company can and should be trusted to responsibly manage the personal data of its more than 2.1 billion users.","#DeleteFacebook began trending last week after reports that Facebook allowed the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access the personal data of as many as 50 million users. According to admissions by Cambridge Analytica, the data was used to develop psychographic profiles to help political campaigns target voters.","In the aftermath of these revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a charm offensive, speaking with reporters, apologizing for mishandling user data and promising to do better in the future.","On Sunday, Zuckerberg took out a full-page ad in multiple U.S. newspapers that read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't we don't deserve it.\"","The ad referred to the Cambridge Analytica operation and the actions of a \"university researcher,\" Aleksandr Kogan, who developed a quiz app in 2014 on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Under Facebook's policy at the time, Kogan was able to pay for a feature called \"friends permission.\" That allowed him to harvest the data of 270,000 quiz-takers, who gave explicit consent to use their data, as well as the data that could be gleaned from their friend networks.","In his ad, Zuckerberg admitted that Kogan's app was not the only one that trawled large amounts of user information. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" Zuckerberg said. He concluded, \"Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\"","Some have taken note of the CEO's apology and applauded the company for taking steps to make its data-sharing policies more transparent. Zuckerberg and other executives at Facebook have published notices explaining steps they're taking to crack down on platform abuses as well as their efforts to make privacy settings more user-friendly.","Others have pointed to the fact that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user data.","\"Facebook says we don't sell your data, but they certainly provide access to it,\" observed Michelle De Mooy, director of the privacy and data project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.","Moreover, Facebook acknowledged that it knew about Cambridge Analytica's questionable contract with Kogan in 2015. At that time, they suspended Kogan and asked him to confirm that he had deleted the user data. According to reports, that user data remained accessible to Cambridge Analytica for years.","\"Facebook has been dragged, seemingly kicking and screaming into being more transparent,\" said Dave Levine, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \"Facebook has not done nearly as much as it could, simply by way of explanation to the public about its behaviors, about how your information or posts are curated, about what kind of data it collects and how it shares it.\"","The Cambridge Analytica breach is only the latest example of the company's opacity and delayed response to public outcry. Facebook has been at the center of the fake news controversy and spreading misinformation during the 2016 election. The company has been called before Congress over their role in facilitating Russian election interference and online terrorist recruitment. And the company finally acknowledged and changed their newsfeed policy after being caught suppressing conservative content.","Each scandal has temporarily hurt Facebook, but the latest scandal over violating users' privacy could be the one that tips the scales and imposes real costs and consequences on the social media giant.","\"Ultimately the problem here is one of trust,\" explained Julian Sanchez, privacy and technology fellow at the Cato Institute. If users no longer believe the company is responsibly handling their information or feel they cannot understand the company's policies for sharing their data, Zuckerberg's apologies will be \"too little, too late,\" Sanchez noted.","\"Once that's burned, once people don't have a sense of trust, I don't know if the specific policy changes will help much,\" he continued. \"Even if they really are making genuine improvements, as it appears they are, once that trust is gone, it's hard to get back.\"","In a new poll conducted in the days after the data sharing scandal erupted, Reuters/Ipsos found that the majority of respondents do not trust Facebook to handle their data.","Facebook was deemed the least trustworthy when it came to obeying laws that protect American's personal information when compared to other companies that gather user data like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo.","\"Maybe the poll is new, but the sentiment is not,\" De Mooy explained. The reason, she said, is that social media platforms \"are designed for opacity,\" intentionally making it harder for users to understand and make informed decisions about their data.","Facebook and other companies that rely on selling access to user data have had to walk a thin line between protecting their users' data and monetizing it. Consistently over recent years, polls have shown that even as users sign up and sign away some of the rights to their data, they are wary of how that information is being used.","Periodically, this concern has translated into relatively short-lived calls for people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, but it is not clear that those efforts have caused the company to fundamentally change how it operates.","\"If a few hundred-thousand people delete their Facebook accounts that will have a marginal impact on their bottom line,\" Levine noted. \"However if there is a reputational hit at the trust level, which is what Facebook needs to maintain in order to be a viable business, that cumulatively could create problems.\"","In recent weeks, Facebook has taken a significant hit with the markets valuing the breach of privacy and trust in the tens of billions. Since the story broke earlier this month, Facebook's stock has plunged more than 15 percent in a selling spree that has cost the company over $75 billion in market value.","Facebook could also be facing even more costs as the consumer protection watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy and data use policies based on the reports about the company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","The FTC already brought charges against Facebook in 2011 for what it termed \"deceptive privacy claims.\" At the time, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC and signed a consent decree which, among other things, required the company to obtain a user's explicit consent before allowing third parties to access their data. Moreover, the agreement required Facebook to inform users if they discovered they were unable to protect their data.","\"Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here,\" former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Jessica Rich told the Washington Post last week. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties.\"","If the FTC finds Facebook in violation of the consent decree, the company could face a $40,000 fine per violation. It is not clear whether that fine would apply to the alleged 50 million users whose data was shared inappropriately with Cambridge Analytica. In a statement to the Post, a Facebook spokesperson said the company rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","De Mooy said she is encouraged by the FTC investigation, emphasizing that \"the consent decrees need to be meaningful.\" However, she worries that regulators simply lack the enforcement authority when it comes to protecting consumer data.","In the United States, consumer data is largely governed by contracts and terms of use agreements between the consumer and the company. This approach is vastly different from the European Union, which will be implementing a new regime of privacy protections, the General Data Protection Regulation, beginning in May.","The new privacy regime will directly impact U.S. tech companies that will be required to be more transparent in informing consumers about their sharing practices in order to get consent. Companies that fail to protect user data can also expect to see millions of dollars in fines.","It is yet to be seen whether U.S. lawmakers, who have traditionally taken a lax approach to regulating internet companies, will take steps to strengthen data privacy protections."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures.

{"originalurl":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-exactly-is-a-facebook-shadow-profile/","title":"What is a Facebook shadow profile | Digital Trends","text":["What’s a Facebook shadow profile, and why should you care?","After the recent security scare over Facebook leaking user information, a dust-up over Facebook shadow profiles has relaunched. A “shadow profile” sounds like something a CIA operative would have – but if you’re a Facebook user, you have a shadow profile, whether you’re a real-life James Bond or just an accountant from Des Moines.","So what is a Facebook shadow profile, and where does yours lurk?","A Facebook shadow profile is a file that Facebook keeps on you containing data it pulls up from looking at the information that a user’s friends voluntarily provide. You’re not supposed to see it, or even know it exists. This collection of information can include phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and other pertinent data about a user that they don’t necessarily put on their public profile. Even if you never gave Facebook your second email address or your home phone number, they may still have it on file, since anyone who uses the “Find My Friends” feature allows Facebook to scan their contacts. So if your friend has your contact info on her phone and uses that feature, Facebook can match your name to that information and add it to your file.","“When people use Facebook, they may store and share information about you.”","Facebook recently announced that it fixed a bug that inadvertently revealed this hidden contact information for six million users. Their mea culpa was not particularly well-received, since this security breach revealed that the social network had been collecting this data on all of its users and compiling it into shadow profiles for years. Some people who use Facebook’s Download Your Information (DYI) tool could see the dossiers Facebook had been collecting as well as information their friends put up themselves. So, if I downloaded my information and was affected by the bug, I’d see some of the email addresses and phone numbers of my friends who did not make that information public.","Although Facebook corrected the bug, it hasn’t stopped this program of accumulating extra information on people. And researchers looking at the numbers say the breach is actually more involved than Facebook initially claimed, with four pieces of data released for a user that Facebook said had one piece of data leaked.","This snafu won’t come as a surprise to researchers who brought up Facebook’s shadow profiles long before this most recent breach. In 2011, an Irish advocacy group filed a complaint against Facebook for collecting information like email addresses, phone numbers, work details, and other data to create shadow profiles for people who don’t use the service. Since it actually takes moral fortitude to resist the social pull of Facebook, this is a slap in the face for people who make a point to stay off the network: The group claimed that Facebook still has profiles for non-Facebookers anyway.","Though the decision to publicly own up to the bug was a step in the right direction, this leak is disturbing because it illustrates just how little control we have over our data when we use services like Facebook. And it illustrates that Facebook isn’t apologizing for collecting information – it’s just apologizing for the bug. The shadow profile will live another day.","Most people understand that Facebook can see, archive, and data-mine the details you voluntarily put up on the site. The reason people are disturbed by shadow profiles is the information was collected in a roundabout way, and users had no control over what was collected (which is how even people who abstain from Facebook may have ended up with dossiers despite their reluctance to get involved with the site). Now we don’t just need to worry about what we choose to share; we also have to worry that the friends we trust with personal information will use programs that collect our data.","To Facebook’s credit, they do make this clear in the privacy policy, it’s just that no one bothers to read it:","“We receive information about you from your friends and others, such as when they upload your contact information, post a photo of you, tag you in a photo or status update, or at a location, or add you to a group. When people use Facebook, they may store and share information about you and others that they have, such as when they upload and manage their invites and contacts.”","Now, the Facebook shadow profiles contain information that many people make public anyways; plenty of people have made their phone numbers and addresses discoverable via a simple Google Search (not that they should, but that’s another story). But if you make a point to keep that kind of information private, this shadow profile business will sting. And even if you don’t mind the fact that Facebook creeped on your phone number via your friends, you should be concerned that next time these shadow profiles make it into the news, it will be over other data-mining that could be potential harmful. Imagine if your credit card information or PIN number ended up going public.","The way Facebook worded its apology is interesting because it doesn’t say that they don’t collect that type of information.","“Additionally, no other types of personal or financial information were included and only people on Facebook – not developers or advertisers – have access to the DYI tool.”","The fact that they said “were included” instead of “were collected” leaves open the possibility that Facebook does have this kind of information on file – it just wasn’t part of this particular mix-up.","Facebook hasn’t reassured users by saying they don’t collect this kind of data, and that’s awfully suspicious; if their shadow data collection was really limited to phone numbers and email addresses, your would think they would’ve explicitly said so, to ameliorate critics. What Facebook isn’t saying here versus what they are saying speaks volumes. The site is sorry for the bug, but not sorry for surreptitiously collecting data on you. And they’re admitting the data that was released in the bug, but not explaining the exact scope of the shadow profile amalgamation.","Facebook’s shadow profiles aren’t uniquely or especially nefarious, but this incident makes it all the more obvious that the amount of data companies are collecting on you far surpasses what you might suspect. And unless there are legislative changes, this will continue unabated.","As part of efforts to put the Cambridge Analytica scandal and related issues behind it, Facebook said this week it's expanding its bug bounty program to include third-party apps and websites that could potentially misuse its data.","There are plenty of legitimate reasons for carrying out a background check, and not all of them are creepy.

Though Facebook claims Cambridge Analytica and its associates broke the rules in retaining and using this data, this wasn’t a breach as we typically think of them: The Times reported that 270,000 of those users willingly gave over their info when they signed up for a personality quiz app.","Developers can request to see your relationship status, education history, and religious and political beliefs, among many other data points, but only if you allow them. For example, I had unknowingly shared all of my Facebook photos and photos tagged of me with TripAdvisor. A hiking app called AllTrails could see all of the timeline posts, while Waze had access to my custom friend lists (including one named “Frenemies”). In any case, now would be a good time to revisit the third-party apps you’ve granted permission to access your Facebook data and review — and maybe revoke — some of the info you’re sharing.","Alternatively, on the desktop interface, click the downward arrow in the top-right corner and select Settings. Then select Apps from the menu. On the apps page, you’ll see all the apps where you’ve logged into Facebook.

Click on the edit button (pencil icon), next to the remove button, to view each app’s individual settings, where you can see all of the data that’s visible to the app. You can revoke specific permissions by deselecting the checkmark next to each data point.","Third-party apps may have already stored data on you, and you’ll need to contact the app developer to delete that information.","You can do this on Facebook in the app’s individual settings page. On the bottom right-hand corner of the settings window, click on Report App. Then select, I want to send my own message to the developer. There, you can request that they remove any information they have stored. It’s not a guarantee, however, that they will respect your request.","Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News","Look at the app’s privacy policy to see more details about how that app is using your data.","In the same row of links in tiny font next to Report App, click on App Privacy Policy, which will take you to the app’s website. There will be a lot of legal mumbo jumbo in here, so just search (command + F) for “Facebook” or “social networks” to go straight to the section that covers integration with social networks.","Another thing to look at on Facebook’s app settings page: Apps Others Use.","This module is near the bottom of the page, underneath the third-party app icons. Click Edit to control what your friends on Facebook can bring with them when they enable third-party apps. Deselect the personal info you don’t want to share.","Your friends could be sharing your religious and political views or what you’re interested in, without your knowledge (or theirs).","If you want to download a copy of all your data, that’s an option, too.","You can download all of your Facebook data — including posts, photos, videos, messages, chats, and your “about” section — by going to Settings and in General, clicking Download a copy of your Facebook data.","The ultimate takeaway is: Review app permissions, not just on Facebook, but forall social media sites, and look closely at what information you’re allowing third-party apps to see.","Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News","Facebook's privacy policy changes from time to time (as former Facebook executive Alex Stamos pointed out in now-deleted tweets), so re-check your third-party app settings regularly, to make sure you're only sharing information what you want to be sharing.

That marked the biggest intraday drop since August 2015.","Also on Monday, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden has written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to demand answers to burning questions regarding its policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Wyden, an influential senator on technology issues, wants to know Facebook’s role in the incident and its overall awareness of third-party collection practices, including why it did not suspend Cambridge Analytica in 2015, when it first became aware of its actions.","Cambridge Analytica was suspended by Facebook on Saturday, after reports in the London Observer and The New York Times revealed the extent of the data haul.","Wyden has also requested copies of every privacy assessment the company had prepared as required in the 2011 US Federal Trace Commission’s consent agreement.","He also asked if the company had made any efforts to identify or notify the 50 million users affected by Cambridge Analytica’s actions.","Also on Monday, Facebook confirmed that Cambridge Analytica has agreed to an audit by a digital forensics firm to determine whether it still has information on 50 million Facebook profiles that it said had been deleted.","Aleksandr Kogan, the researcher who originally obtained the data via the social network and allegedly shared it with Cambridge Analytica, has also verbally agreed to an audit, Facebook wrote Monday in a blog post.","Cambridge, which worked for US President Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, was required to destroy the information in 2015 when Facebook learned it had the data, but reportedly failed to do so. Cambridge has denied wrongdoing.","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.”","Senator Wyden joins other politicians on both sides of the Atlantic who are calling on CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear before lawmakers to explain how Cambridge Analytica, the UK-based data analysis firm that helped Donald Trump win the US presidency, was able to harvest the personal information.","Facebook has already testified about how its platform was used by Russian propagandists ahead of the 2016 election, but the company never put Zuckerberg himself in the spotlight with government leaders.","The pressure may also foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network.","US Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, for public questioning.","In a letter Monday to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Klobuchar and Kennedy said they have “serious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of American was misused in order to influence voters.”","“The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,” the senators wrote.","A hearing with the CEOs would allow the committee to learn “what is being done to protect Americans’ data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections.”","Facebook on Friday said that a professor used Facebook’s login tools to get people to sign up for what he claimed was a personality analysis app he had designed for academic purposes.","To take the quiz, 270,000 people gave the app permission to access data via Facebook on themselves and their friends, exposing a network of 50 million people, according to The New York Times.","That kind of access was allowed per Facebook’s rules at the time.","Afterward, the professor violated Facebook’s terms when he passed along that data to Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook found out about the breach in 2015, shut down the professor’s access and asked Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted the user data.","Yet the social network on Friday suspended Cambridge from its system, explaining that it had learned the information wasn’t erased.","Cambridge, originally funded by conservative political donor Robert Mercer, on Saturday denied that it still had access to the user data, and said it was working with Facebook on a solution.","A researcher who worked with the professor on the app is now currently an employee at Facebook, which is reviewing whether he knew about the data leak.","The denials and internal inquiries did little to ease the criticism.","Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Sunday that Zuckerberg or another senior executive should appear in front of his committee because previous witnesses have avoided difficult questions, creating “a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","He added in an interview on British radio Monday that Zuckerberg should “stop hiding behind his Facebook page and actually come out and answer questions about his company.”","The next few weeks represent a critical time for Facebook to reassure users and regulators about its content standards and platform security, to prevent rules that could affect its main advertising business, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.","“Changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote in a note to investors.","Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to explain that the mishandling of user data was out of its hands and doesn’t constitute a “breach” – a definition that would require the company to alert users about whether their information was taken, per US Federal Trade Commission rules.","The site, which is based in Menlo Park, California, no longer allows app developers to ask for access to data on users’ friends.","But the improper handling of the data raises systemic questions about how much companies can be trusted to protect personal information, said Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology.","“While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways,” O’Connor said in a statement.","“Communications technologies have become an essential part of our daily lives, but if we are unable to have control of our data, these technologies control us.

Martin","​A Virginia man who was accused on Friday of threatening to kill a U.S. congressman described himself as a “natural born conservative” in a lawsuit last year and appears to have a Facebook account where he expressed anti-Muslim and conspiratorial views as well as posted memes supportive of President Donald Trump.","Wallace Godwin, 69, was charged in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia with one count of threatening to murder and assault a U.S. official. In unveiling the charge, prosecutors said it was based on a confrontation that took place the day before, on March 22, at the district office of Republican Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia.","Prosecutors said Godwin was frustrated about federal marijuana policy and allegedly made the threat to one of Taylor’s staffers.","“Scott is having an event this Saturday. I am going to get my shotgun and do something about this. I’ll just handle this myself,\" Godwin said, according to federal court documents.","The court documents allege that Godwin then pointed at two staffers in the room and said: “You two are next.”","Prosecutors said that if convicted Godwin could face 10 years in prison.","This wasn’t the first time Godwin had been volatile around Taylor and his staff, according to court records.","In an incident last year, Godwin allegedly drove to the Virginia congressman’s house and blocked Taylor’s car with his own. He told Taylor he wanted to talk about marijuana policy. The congressman told Goldwin to leave, and Godwin left “without further incident,” according to court records.","In another confrontation last year, the records said, Godwin went to Taylor’s district office, “leaned over the reception desk, and began to yell” at a staffer. It was frightening enough that the congressman’s office reported Godwin to the U.S. Capitol Police at the time.","Godwin’s views about marijuana were also clear in a federal lawsuit he filed on June 22, 2017 in which he described himself as a “natural born conservative” and claimed the government wasn’t enforcing the Controlled Substances Act.","Godwin, who asked the court to award him $500 million, represented himself in the suit in which he named the “U.S. federal government” as the sole defendant.","The lawsuit didn’t make any substantial legal argument or cite specific evidence for his claim. Instead, Godwin attached a printout from the website of Americans for Safe Access, an organization that advocates for the legalization of medical marijuana. The page Godwin included explained that “cannabis is still illegal under federal law” despite medical marijuana laws in many of the states. (An more-recent version of the page can be found on the organization’s website.)","Godwin also added a personal statement in his lawsuit:","Know your facts! I am a natural born conservative. Read the Federal law on marijuana. President Nixon ignored the Federal law on marijuana. Marijuana has been altering the minds of the American people since the early 60's. Check my facts! This is the FACT!","The statement was followed by Godwin’s name, home address in Virginia Beach, Virginia, as well as his home and cell phone numbers.","An assistant U.S. attorney in Norfolk ended up filing a 12-page response to Godwin’s lawsuit and asked for it to be thrown out.","A federal judge dismissed the suit less than four months after Godwin filed it.","Godwin also appears to have used a Facebook account under the name Wally Godwin, listed as a resident of Virginia Beach, to make some of the same criticisms of marijuana policy that he did in the lawsuit.","In fact, the account was used to post several marijuana-related comments last year on a video from the same congressman Godwin is accused of threatening.","The video, which was streamed live on Taylor’s Facebook page, showed the congressman speaking at a February 20, 2017 town hall in Virginia Beach.","“I am a natural born conservative,” Godwin wrote, using a phrase that would be repeated in the lawsuit four months later. “We had a law against Marijuana when Nixon was President it has become a Forgotten law.”","Beyond gripes about marijuana, Godwin’s Facebook account also promoted an array of far-right content, including conspiracy theories and posts that showed anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant views. He also reposted multiple memes that were supportive of President Trump.","Two days before Godwin’s arrest, the account shared a post from WikiLeaks that talked the “deep state,” something that has turned into a well-traveled conspiracy theory among the far right during the Trump administration.","Godwin’s account also included a variety of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and other far-right posts.","In one, he shared a video mentioning Sharia law, an Islamic concept that has been the source of wild conspiracy theories in anti-Muslim circles. The video included claims like “Sharia orders death for any Muslim or non Muslim who critics (sic) the Quran.”","Godwin also shared a post calling on President Trump to “BAN ISLAM IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS.”"],"isopubdate":""}

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

His departure will come in the wake of disagreements with other Facebook executives like COO Sheryl Sandberg about how to investigate and disclose Russian activity on the platform, The New York Times reports, citing employees of the social network. Prior to his hiring at Facebook in 2015, Stamos was Chief Information Security Officer at Yahoo!","Personnel on Stamos’ security team—which previously numbered 120 but is now down to three—are being gradually transferred to the product and infrastructure divisions within Facebook, under his supervision. The NYT report suggests that this has been his primarily responsibility since December, when his normal day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned. He was asked by Facebook to stay through August for optics.","This news broke shortly after Facebook came under intense scrutiny over the inappropriate acquisition of its user data by Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm involved in elections in both the US and the UK. Stamos took to Twitter to defend the company—in particular, he sought to clarify that this was not a “data breach.” He also said in a tweet that has since been deleted:","It should be noted that several other prominent platforms, like Android and iOS, allow access to friend (contact) data with user permission. Like us, those platforms have policies about the use of data, but misusing contacts gathered knowingly from a phone is also not a “breach”.","Stamos later deleted those tweets, saying he “should have done a better job weighing in.” Echoing some of the concerns that reportedly led to his departure, he later tweeted:","There are a lot of big problems that the big tech companies need to be better at fixing. We have collectively been too optimistic about what we build and our impact on the world.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The 23-page lawsuit—which also names SCL Group, its Cambridge Analytica LLC subsidiary, and Global Science Research Ltd. (GSR) as Facebook’s “co-conspirators” – further alleges that these additional three defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).","“On information and belief, Co-Conspirators agreed to and did conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the Political Deceit and Manipulation Enterprise’s affairs in a pattern of racketeering activity targeted at intentionally defrauding Facebook users including, without limitation, via nominal payments and numerous intentionally false representations averred herein with the specific intent of inducing Facebook users to unwittingly share other users’ private User Information.”","The timeline detailed in the case begins in June 2014, when SCL—Strategic Communication Laboratories—entered into a written agreement with Global Science Research Ltd. to “harvest and process” Facebook users’ data so that Cambridge Analytica could analyze it “to manipulate the American public in upcoming elections,” the complaint says. This was accomplished by way of a fake personality quiz available to users through GSR’s “thisismydigitallife” app, whereby the company gained access to not only the Facebook data of individuals who took the quiz, but that of each of their Facebook friends as well, according to the suit. From the complaint:","“The result was that around 320,000 Facebook users took these fake quizzes, resulting in 50 million people having their private User Information harvested for use by SCL and CAMBRIDGE, without their consent. These entities and individuals later used the data to manipulate and attempt to manipulate the voting of the American public.”","The lawsuit charges that Facebook knew—or should have known—of its co-defendants’ alleged data harvesting scheme when it commenced back in 2014, yet stood aside without stopping it. According to the lawsuit, a former Facebook operations manager who handled data breaches by third-party software developers on the platform in 2011 and 2012 said the company knew of the risk posed by third-party apps with regard to obtaining the information of those who had not provided authorization. The former employee said that rather than directly addressing the risk, Facebook instead relied “on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand,” according to the suit.","By the time Facebook contacted Cambridge Analytica in August 2016 ordering that the data it harvested must be deleted, disposing of the data was, by that time, pointless, the lawsuit claims, as it had “already been used and weaponized against the American public.”","“Facebook never notified the 50 million users that their User Information had been compromised,” the complaint states.","The proposed class named in the lawsuit includes all individuals across the United States whose personal information was stored by Facebook and who had such data accessed by the co-defendants without or in excess of authorization.","The complaint can be read below.","This browser does not support PDFs.

Facebook has suspended the accounts of the firm along with Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan and consultant-turned-whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, who were responsible for harvesting the data from Facebook.","The personal data was gathered using a Facebook application called “thisisyourdigitallife” created by Kogan through his firm Global Science Research (GSR). The data was passed on to Cambridge Analytica, which claims to have deleted the data when the company realised that it was collected contrary to Facebook’s terms of service.","Psychometric profile for targeted advertising","The original idea was to use the collected data to target political ads at people based on their psychometric profiles. This concept was adapted by Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from work done in part by another Cambridge University psychologist, David Stillwell. Along with researchers Matz, Kosinski and Nave, Stillwell showed that advertising that was tailored to a person’s level of extraversion or openness was far more effective at getting them to click on an ad and ultimately buy something.","The psychometric personality profile was built up by asking the users to complete an assessment questionnaire and also to allow an application to look at the user’s Facebook posts and likes. The profile is based on five factors:","The process of working out the profile and then targeting the ads is not actually that sophisticated, as the ads designed for low and high extraversion show.","Facebook is not committed to protecting its users’ data","Facebook does not make the process of collecting data from its platform particularly difficult. It is essentially an “honour code” with few negative consequences to those that abuse it. Facebook itself uses this type of approach to target ads to users and so refrains from criticising others for doing the same. Facebook has itself experimented with influencing the voting intentions of its users without getting their informed consent.","The simple fact of the matter is that as long as for-profit companies make their money out of advertising, they will try and make that advertising as effective as possible by gathering ever more detailed personal and behavioural information about their users to target ads and make them more effective. Social media and search companies such as Facebook and Google have little incentive other than the risk of government regulation and fines to limit the amount and types of information collected or the ways in which this information is used to target users with ads.","US and European officials are again raising questions about Facebook’s willingness to protect users’ data and to not allow its platform to be abused by governments and private interests to influence political outcomes. Previous attempts to seek answers from Facebook have largely failed, even during official hearings. The threat of fines to change the tech companies’ behaviour is also not completely effective, as company lawyers challenge every action by governments and the fines that companies face are seen as simply a cost of doing business.","The best way to protect yourself from social networks? Leave them","Users of social networks are now being advised about how to protect their data from apps. In 2014, Facebook changed the way applications could access the list of friends for a particular user. After the change, apps could only get information about the friends of a user if they themselves were using the app.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stated that Facebook will reduce the access that applications have to user data even further in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, this will still not stop those determined to harvest user data from doing so. If the list of a user’s Facebook friends is set to public, it is possible to simply use a program to “scrape” the data without using a direct programming interface. A simple search on Google reveals many applications and scripts that will do this.","Even changing Facebook’s privacy settings to keep your list of friends private does not necessarily stop anyone from knowing things about you. Anything that is available publically through the profile of one of your friends may include information about you. Also, making information private does not stop Facebook from using it even though the company claims that you can control this. It only applies to information obtained from outside of Facebook, and the firm can still exploit user information to target ads and for any other purpose it chooses.","And while users can block Facebook ads by using extensions such as F.B. Purity, this simply means giving yet another company access to your personal data.","In the end, the only way we have to limit the use of our personal data by social media is to avoid joining the platforms in the first place. This means not having an account at all, because setting up a profile and logging in even once leaves the ability to be tracked when visiting other sites. And if you’re already on Facebook, the best way to protect your personal data is to delete the account completely and permanently. While it may seem like a radical solution, it’s the only truly effective one."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

On Friday, Facebook announced Cambridge Analytica — the firm that was created by billionaire donor Robert Mercer, previously run by Steve Bannon, who went on to become White House chief strategist, and received $5.9 million from Mr. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign — has been suspended for violating the social media company's standards and practices.","Christopher Wylie, who worked to help obtain the data, told Britain's The Guardian that Cambridge's entire operation was designed to \"exploit\" what they knew about people from their profiles and \"target their inner demons.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in \"psychographic\" profiling that allows them to predict the voting likelihoods of individual people based on personality — and Facebook is a treasure trove for information like that.","In statement released early Sunday, Wylie said he feels a \"sense of regret every day when I see where [Cambridge Analytics] have helped take our world.\"","\"If privacy and democracy are to mean anything in a digital age, Facebook has to face up to its shared responsibilities,\" Wylie said.","He told the Guardian \"we exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.\"","Wylie was suspended from Facebook along with Cambridge Analytica and University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan. Wylie's attorney Tamsin Allen, said upon learning data harvesting was about to made public, Facebook \"privately welcomed\" Wylie's offer to help.","\"This behaviour is more consistent with damage limitation than with a genuine attempt to resolve a serious problem,\" Allen said.","\"We use nearly five thousand different data points about you to craft and target a message,\" Nix told TechRepublic senior reporter Dan Patterson. \"The data points are not just a representative model of you. The data points are about you, specifically.\"","In a statement Friday, Facebook acknowledged that it learned it had been \"lied to\" about Cambridge Analytica and an affiliate's activities in 2015, more than two years before suspending the firm from its platform, but did not alert users at the time.

Facebook says it is still investigating those claims. The New York Times also reported that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica still existed online, and reporters accessed the raw data.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it \"fully complies with Facebook's terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\" The company also said it deleted all information.","\"In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,\" Cambridge said in a statement. \"This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn’t authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports “several days ago” that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook’s unusual public explanation of the move wasn’t clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large scale research project in the U.S.,” but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company. For the “avoidance of doubt,” the spokesman said, none of Kogan’s data was used in Cambridge Analytica’s 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign .","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Nix said Assange said no. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.

Sunday’s crash was believed to be the first fatality in any testing program involving autonomous vehicles.","The National Transportation Safety Board opened an investigation into the crash, NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said.","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a tweet that the company was working to learn what went wrong.","“Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,” he said. “We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.”","The company did not respond to questions about how long the moratorium would last.","The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the crash, though a driver was behind the wheel, Tempe police said in a statement. The crash occurred about 10 p.m. near a busy intersection with multiple lanes in every direction.","Police said the northbound vehicle was approaching Curry Road when a woman, identified as Elaine Herzberg, was crossing from the west side of the street and was struck. She died at a hospital, the department said.","An Uber driverless car is displayed in a garage in San Francisco. Uber suspended all of its self-driving testing Monday, March 19, 2018, after what is believed to be the first fatal pedestrian crash involving the vehicles. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)","Driverless vehicles are being developed by some of the biggest names in American technology and manufacturing. Waymo, formerly Google’s self-driving car project, also is very active in Arizona, ferrying ordinary residents around with no backup human driver behind the wheel.","Many major automakers, General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Volvo, and Tesla among them — are at various stages of developing, deploying or testing autonomous technologies. In all, 50 manufacturers have secured permits from California regulators to test autonomous cars in that state with safety chaperones behind the wheel. Next month, new regulations will take effect in California allowing technology developers to apply to test and deploy cars without a human behind the wheel if they meet various safety, notification and other criteria.","Federal transportation officials have relied on voluntary safety reporting to oversee the burgeoning industry, which has emphasized the life-saving potential of the technology in arguing against government mandates. Some states, like Arizona, welcome this approach. Some advocates say the federal government should establish strict mandatory safety and reporting standards. Others say Congress must “preempt” states from putting in place patchwork of safety regulations.","Critics have cautioned that the industry is rushing untested technology onto the roads, while supporters say fatalities are an inevitable part of the learning process.","Missy Cummings, a robotics expert at Duke University who has been critical of the swift rollout of driverless technology, said the computer-vision systems for self-driving cars are “deeply flawed” and can be “incredibly brittle,” particularly in unfamiliar circumstances.","Companies have not been required by the federal government to prove that their robotic driving systems are safe. “We’re not holding them to any standards right now,” Cummings said, arguing that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should provide real supervision.","But Carrie Morton, deputy director of Mcity, the University of Michigan’s 32-acre test facility simulating urban and suburban environments for self-driving vehicles, said the technology requires a combination of real-world and controlled testing to perfect.","“We have brought a tremendous amount of complexity into Mcity, but you really need some real-world exposure as well,” she said.","In general, she said, autonomous vehicles have a variety of backup mechanisms to account for anomalies such as a pedestrian in the roadway. Mcity tests those capabilities, but environments like it can only do so much.","“What we can say at this point is it just underscores the need to continue on-road testing,” she said.","At the end of 2016, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) issued a statement touting the state’s wide-open welcome to tech companies, including Uber, which were bristling at the rules in California — another state at the vanguard of the industry.","“Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads. While California puts the brakes on innovation and change with more bureaucracy and more regulation, Arizona is paving the way for new technology and new businesses,” Ducey said. “California may not want you, but we do.”","Monday, Patrick Ptak, a spokesman for Ducey, said: “Safety is our top priority.” He did not address a question on whether the death might change anything about the state’s policies.","Ptak said Ducey’s “latest executive order provides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.”","Cummings said approaches like that of Arizona have consequences. “If you’re going take that first step out, then you’re also going to be the first entity to have to suffer these kinds of issues,” she said.","Driverless technology firms generally say they painstakingly map an area digitally before running their vehicles there, so that the vehicles essentially have banked information about the surroundings that can be compared on the fly to what cameras and sensors are picking up at any moment.","Tempe police said Herzberg was “walking outside of the crosswalk” when she was struck.","“Just because you map an area doesn’t mean your computer system is necessarily going to pick up a pedestrian, particularly one that wasn’t in a cross walk,” Cummings said.","Another industry-wide issue is to what extent autonomous vehicles can deal with unanticipated problems.","“The car cameras, the vision systems, they don’t perform inductively, meaning they can’t guess about the appearance of someone in a particular place and time,” Cummings said. “Pedestrians get hit by human drivers all the time for similar reasons,” though the exact cause of this crash remains unclear, she said.","Timothy Carone, an associate teaching professor specializing in autonomous systems at the University of Notre Dame, said fatal crashes involving autonomous vehicles, while tragic, will become more commonplace as testing is introduced and further expanded.","Road testing is the only way the systems can learn and adjust to their environments, eventually reaching a level of safety that cuts down on the number of motor vehicle deaths overall, he said.","“It’s going to be difficult to accept the deaths … but at some point you’ll start to see the curve bend,” he said. “The fact is these things will save lives and we need to get there.”","He compared the self-driving rollout to the early history of aviation, which was beset by safety incidents in the early years of commercial flight, but has now gained near-universal respect as the safest form of mass transportation.","“Hopefully it happens much faster and with a much shorter time scale,” he said of autonomous vehicles.","Carone said that if the self-driving technology was ultimately responsible for Sunday’s fatality, Uber and authorities will have to “interrogate” the system to determine what went wrong.","“It’s not just one thing that goes wrong — there’s a series of several to maybe several thousand steps that led to the death,” said Carone, author of the forthcoming book “Future Automation — Changes to Lives and to Businesses.” Using data, he said, “They have to figure out, and determine if they can figure out, ‘why did the system make a decision that caused the death?’”","The incident focuses national attention on Uber’s self-driving program, in which it has ambitiously invested in to position itself as a key player in the world of autonomous driving.","Last March the company temporarily suspended its self-driving fleet after a Volvo XC90 overturned when another driver failed to yield, according to Tempe police. Authorities said the Uber, which had a backup driver, was not at fault. But it was the first major crash involving the company’s self-driving fleet.","Sunday’s fatality, for the first time, raised numerous, non-hypothetical questions about who is liable in the event of a pedestrian death involving an autonomous vehicle.","Matt Henshon, a Boston lawyer who has written and spoken widely on artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, said that while a civil suit would be fairly straightforward, the question of potential criminal liability is much more complicated.","Could the human driver have intervened? Were developers negligent in their design and rollout of the software? Was a nonworking sensor missed by inspectors?","“The analogy is autopilot, in the airline case, where you put it on autopilot but the pilot still remains legally responsible,” he said. “Would they have been able to do something?”","He said it raised a key question: “Who had ultimate responsibility, the human driver or the car itself?” he asked. But even if the car was deemed responsible, mechanical and software-related questions would also come up.","“What bug was in there?” he said. “Was it reasonable for somebody to miss the bug?”","A civil case would be much more straightforward.","“If I’m representing the decedent … I’m suing the city for allowing everyone to do it,” he said. “But Uber’s my main target.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The social media giant formally announced changes it claims will make it easier for users to control what they share in a post titled \"It's Time to Make Our Privacy Tools Easier to Find.\"","The release, authored by Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan and Deputy General Counsel Ashlie Beringer, touts improved functionality and design of individual privacy settings on the platform. But that is something it's been promising since 2006. The release employed stock language that Facebook has trotted out repeatedly when faced with questions over how it handles user data and privacy.","Since 2006, Facebook has repeatedly promised to safeguard users' data through redesigns and by putting privacy controls front and center. Each time they claim to have heard and acted on feedback from users.","Here are some key passages from each of those updates:","March 2018: \"Put people in control of their privacy\"","In this most recent release, Facebook says, \"We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed. We're taking additional steps in the coming weeks to put people more in control of their privacy.\" Egan and Beringer added that the features have been \"in the works for some time.\"","January 2017: Making privacy tools \"easy to find\"","In this release on Data Privacy Day, Facebook announced an initiative to make privacy controls easier to find: a feature titled \"Privacy Basics.\" The company wrote, \"Built using your feedback, everything is organized so that information about protecting your privacy is easy to find.\" The purpose of this tool was to put already existing controls front-and-center, giving the user control over what they were sharing, and with whom.","September 2014: \"Be in control of what you share\"","In this release, Facebook introduced a new tool called \"Privacy Checkup.\" Product manager Paddy Underwood wrote: \"We know you come to Facebook to connect with friends, not with us. But we also know how important it is to be in control of what you share and who you share with.\" The feature presented users with a three-step process to modify who could see their posts, applications that are connected to their account and who could view personal details on their profiles.","May 2010: \"A simpler way to control their information\"","Around this time, Facebook users, internet advocacy groups, and politicians had expressed concern about how account data was being used on Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post where he discussed changing privacy controls on the site. In summary, these changes purported to give users more control over what other users, advertisers and connected applications could and could not see on profiles and, for the first time, claimed it would consolidate all the settings on one page, just as it did on Wednesday.","In a wide-ranging press release, Facebook claimed to be \"redesigning privacy.\" \"Over the past few weeks, the number one thing we've heard is that many users want a simpler way to control their information,\" the release said. \"Today we're starting to roll out changes that will make our controls simpler and easier.\"","\"New settings will give the more than 400 million people who use Facebook the power to control exactly who can see the information and content they share, all with just a few simple clicks,\" it continued. \"In addition, new settings will be added to make it easier to turn off third-party applications or websites.\"","December 2009: \"Making the controls easy, intuitive\"","In a response to feedback from Facebook users and online experts, the Vice President of Communications, Public Policy and Marketing contributed to an extensive release where Facebook again made design promises: \"[M]any users have expressed that the current set of privacy choices are confusing or overwhelming. In response, the Privacy Settings page has been completely redesigned with a goal of making the controls easy, intuitive and accessible.\"","At the bottom of the release, the company wrote, \"Facebook has never shared personal information with advertisers except under the direction and control of a user. These new tools do not alter that policy or practice.\"","March 2008: \"Giving users more control\"","In this release, Facebook announced privacy updates that would give users -- you guessed it -- greater control over the visibility of their content to specific individuals, writing, \"Facebook will be introducing privacy updates that give users more control over the information they choose to share on Facebook.\"","September 2006: \"Additional controls for news feed\"","At this time, Facebook called themselves a \"social utility\" in one of their first press releases on privacy, announcing, \"additionalcontrols for News Feed and Mini-Feed in response to user feedback and to reaffirm its commitment to industry-leading privacy practices.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

We expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.”","It comes a day after Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, accused Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive of making “false statements” to MPs.","Alexander Nix “deliberately misled the committee and Parliament” by denying his company had received data from the Global Science Research (GSR) company, Mr Collins said in a statement, referencing reports in The Observer that tens of millions of Facebook users’ data had been captured by GSR in a deal with Cambridge Analytica.","But Cambridge Analytica denied Mr Nix’s testimony was misleading, saying it “strongly refutes that reporting because it is wrong”.","A spokesperson told The Independent: “Alexander Nix did not mislead the committee. He told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had received data from GSR in relation to a research project that they undertook on our behalf in 2014.","“He went on to say that Cambridge Analytica does not hold or use any data received from GSR. This is because Cambridge Analytica, in cooperation with Facebook, deleted all data and derivatives received from GSR after it came to light that GSR, as data controller, had contravened its contract with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s terms of service.","“None of this data was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","The company was “very happy” to answer further questions from Mr Collins and the committee, it added.","Its statement appeared to contradict the official transcript of the 27 February oral evidence session on whether it had received data from GSR, however.

Accordingly we are sure you will understand the need for a representative from right at the top of the organisation to address concerns. Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to “fixing” Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.”","Regardless of rising pressure around what is now a major public scandal — including the FTC opening an investigation — Zuckerberg has declined the committee’s summons.","In a statement a company spokesperson said it has offered its CTO or chief product officer to answer questions.","“We have responded to Mr Collins and the DCMS and offered for two senior company representatives from our management team to meet with the Committee depending on timings most convenient for them. Mike Schroepfer is Chief Technology Officer and is responsible for Facebook’s technology including the company’s developer platform. Chris Cox is Facebook’s Chief Product Officer and leads development of Facebook’s core products and features including News Feed. Both Chris Cox and Mike Schroepfer report directly to Mark Zuckerberg and are among the longest serving senior representatives in Facebook’s 15 year history,” the spokesperson said.","Facebook declined to answer additional questions.","Collins made a statement before today’s evidence session of the DCMS committee, which is hearing from Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie — saying it would still like to hear from Zuckerberg, even if he isn’t able to provide evidence in person.","“We will seek to clarify with Facebook whether he is available to give evidence or not, because that wasn’t clear from our correspondence,” he said. “If he is available to give evidence, then we will be happy to do that either in person or by video link if that will be more convenient for him.”","Update: Collins returned to the theme of the Facebook founder’s reluctance to put in a personal appearance to answer questions about the issue more than once during the four hour oral hearing, remarking later: “I must say that given the extraordinary evidence we’ve heard so far today, and the things we’ve heard in the other enquiry, I think it’s absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning in front of a parliamentary or congressional hearing given that these are questions of a fundamental importance and concern to Facebook users and to our enquiry as well.”","“We would certainly urge him to think again if he has any care for people who use him company’s services,” he added."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

In a letter to the court, Berman wrote that the government opposes Facebook’s motion to dismiss the case, and that Facebook is not entitled to immunity from liability for content on its platforms.","In February 2017, in response to a ProPublica investigation, Facebook pledged to crack down on efforts by advertisers of rental housing to discriminate against tenants based on race, disability, gender and other characteristics.","But a new lawsuit, filed Tuesday by the National Fair Housing Alliance in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, alleges that the world’s largest social network still allows advertisers to discriminate against legally protected groups, including mothers, the disabled and Spanish-language speakers.","Since 2018 marks the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, “it is all the more egregious and shocking” that “Facebook continues to enable landlords and real estate brokers to bar families with children, women and others from receiving rental and sales ads or housing,” the lawsuit states. It asks the court, among other things, to declare that Facebook’s policies violate fair housing laws, to bar the company from publishing discriminatory ads, and to require it to develop and make public a written fair housing policy for advertising.","Diane Houk, lead counsel for the alliance, said this type of discrimination is especially difficult to uncover and combat. “The person who is being discriminated against has no way to know” it, because the technology “keeps the discrimination hidden in hopes that it will not be caught,” she said.","Facebook disputes the housing groups’ allegations. “There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,” said Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne.","The lawsuit adds to Facebook’s woes, which are mounting on multiple fronts. The company’s stock plunged last week on the news that it had allowed a voter-profiling outfit, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain data on 50 million of its users without their knowledge or consent. The news came after a troubling year in which, among other things, Facebook admitted that it unwittingly allowed a Russian disinformation operation on its platform and had been promoting fake news in its News Feed algorithm. As a result, lawmakers and regulators around the world have launched investigations into Facebook.","Discrimination in housing advertising has been a persistent problem for Facebook. In October 2016, we described how Facebook let advertisers exclude specific groups with what it called “ethnic affinities,” including blacks and Hispanics, from seeing ads. Although Facebook responded by announcing it had built a system to flag and reject these ads, we bought dozens of rental housing ads in November 2017 that we specified would not be shown to blacks, Jews, people interested in wheelchair ramps and other groups.","It wasn’t until ProPublica brought the issue of advertising discrimination on Facebook to light, Houk said, that fair housing advocates learned of it. Emulating ProPublica’s technique, the Washington, D.C.-based national fair housing group, along with member groups in New York, San Antonio and Miami created fake housing companies and placed discriminatory ads on Facebook. The ads were approved by Facebook over a period of a few months, with the most recent buys occurring on Feb. 23.","Using Facebook’s dropdown “exclusion” menu, they were able to buy housing ads that blocked groups such as “trendy moms,” “soccer moms,” “parents with teenagers,” people interested in a disabled parking permit and people interested in Telemundo, the Spanish-language television network.","The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to publish any advertisement “with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin.” Violators may face tens of thousands of dollars in fines.","After ProPublica’s investigation, Facebook added a self-certification option, which asks housing advertisers to certify that their advertisement is not discriminatory. In some cases, Houk said, the housing groups encountered the self-certification option, and did not submit the ads to Facebook for approval and publication. But that only happened in some of the ad buys, she said.","Since advertisers can falsely attest to fairness, the self-certification screens don’t “seem like a whole-hearted commitment to trying to change the advertising platform to comply with the Fair Housing Act and local fair housing laws,” Houk said.","A couple of weeks after the groups bought housing ads, so did ProPublica (independently) — and we excluded some of the same categories, such as “soccer moms.” In most of those tests, we encountered self-certification screens. However, when we bought another housing ad this week, we were able to exclude people interested in Telemundo.","Houk said there were so many possible explanations for the difference in results — such as the number of categories excluded or the types of exclusions sought — that it was impossible to speculate about what caused many of her clients’ ad purchases to be approved but not ProPublica’s.","Both the fair housing groups and ProPublica found that Facebook has blocked the use of race as an exclusion category — as it promised to do in November. Facebook rejected a ProPublica housing ad that was specifically aimed at African Americans. It also denied our attempts to buy employment ads targeted by race, and removed a job listing with a question designed to filter by race. However, the housing groups’ and ProPublica’s ability to exclude people interested in Telemundo suggests that advertisers could still discriminate by using proxies for race or ethnicity.","In a separate federal case in California, challenging Facebook’s use of racial exclusions in ad targeting, Facebook has argued that it has immunity against liability for such discrimination. It cited Section 230 of the 1996 federal Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for third-party content.","“Advertisers, not Facebook, are responsible for both the content of their ads and what targeting criteria to use, if any,” Facebook contended.","Julia Angwin is a senior reporter at ProPublica. From 2000 to 2013, she was a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, where she led a privacy investigative team that was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Reporting in 2011 and won a Gerald Loeb Award in 2010.","Close this overlay (subscribe to our email)","Close this overlay (search)","Close this overlay (Creative Commons)","Republish This Story for Free","Thank you for your interest in republishing this story.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech. Before that, she was the Wall Street Journal's first full-time beat reporter covering big data, artificial intelligence, and the impact of algorithms on people's lives.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2FZdgCf?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.136fa02366a8","title":"U.S. and British lawmakers demand answers from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg - The Washington Post","text":["Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are calling on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how the names, preferences and other information from tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm connected with President Trump's 2016 campaign.","The demands came in response to news reports Saturday about how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, used a feature once available to Facebook app developers to collect information on 270,000 people and, in the process, gain access to data on tens of millions of their Facebook “friends” — few, if any, of whom had given explicit permission for this sharing.","Though both companies have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either nation.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

In 2015, Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm that worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, harvested the Facebook login data of 270,000 people to also access data and information about many of their friends. It’s a violation of Facebook’s terms of service that ultimately affected roughly 50 million users and their data, which could have included information about their locations and interests, as well as photos, status updates and check-ins. To make matters worse, the social network is also investigating ties between one of its current researchers, who previously worked at Cambridge Analytica.","The fallout from this latest scandal has been swift and severe. Two former federal officials who drafted the consent decree governing how Facebook handles user privacy say the social network may have violated that decree, which could result in millions of dollars of fines against Facebook.","But what has been most disappointing is how Facebook handled the situation. When the news broke on Friday, Facebook approached it in the same diffuse way it handled revelations that Russia had used the platform to help sway the presidential election: denied it. The social network contended this was not, in fact, a “data breach,” and that its platform performed precisely as Facebook had always intended. Instead it was an outside party — Cambridge Analytica, in this case — that violated the company’s terms of service. Translation: Facebook’s security remained intact during this incident, and none of this was Facebook’s fault.","While Facebook may not have been “hacked” in the technical sense, there’s no denying that the personal data of some 50 million people was harvested unknowingly and unwillingly for means other than what those people intended, indicating there was some sort of breach, if not of the Facebook platform, then surely of those users’ privacy.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook,” Facebook VP & Deputy General Counsel said in a statement. “If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Facebook’s biggest failure","Equally as egregious is the argument that Facebook is somehow not at fault here. While the social network had already updated its terms of service since 2015 so as not to enable developers to do what Cambridge Analytica did, Facebook failed to disclose the incident until it was reported two years or so later, which has many wondering. Would Facebook have suspended the whistleblower’s Facebook account if the report had not surfaced? Would the social network have disclosed the incident at all? Doubtful.","Facebook’s real failing here — a mistake it has made time and again — is that it shirks responsibility for its shortcomings. When critics assailed the social network for the inadvertent role it played in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Facebook was extremely slow to accept culpability. It wasn’t a “media company” — it was a nonpartisan technology platform that just so happened to distribute real and fake news. And its eventual response to fulfilling that mantra was de-emphasizing national news in users News Feeds.","Now as Facebook stumbles through its latest controversy, more people are calling for regulation of the social network. If the social network can’t police itself, critics argue that perhaps the government should step in.","Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, captured much of the sentiment via Twitter Saturday:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","It’s too early to say whether the Cambridge Analytica snafu will have any material impact on Facebook’s top and bottom line in the short term. My gut as a longtime tech reporter tells me it won’t. Like it or not, Facebook remains the No. 3 most visited websitein the U.S. and the world with 2.13 billion-plus monthly users — those are tantalizing stats many marketers will continue to find almost impossible to overlook.","But Facebook’s latest controversy has sewn more seeds of distrust in the public eye, at least those discerning people who care enough about what data websites collect about them, what they do with it, and what they fail to do if their data is abused for other purposes. Surely, that’s hardly what its idealistic CEO Mark Zuckerberg intended.","JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business.

The trail allegedly leads back to a Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" a personality quiz that was billed as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","He legitimately gained access to information on 270,000 accounts through Facebook's Login feature, which lets people use their Facebook account to log into outside apps so they don't have to create new user names and passwords. At the time Kogan allegedly collected the information, Facebook allowed developers to also access information not only from the people who opted into the feature, but some other data about their network of friends. That added up to info from 50 million accounts, according to the New York Times. (Facebook changed its rules three years ago to stop developers from seeing information about people's friends.)","So far, Kogan's data-gathering was all above board and in compliance with Facebook's rules.","But in 2015, Facebook learned that Kogan had passed on that data to Cambridge Analytica, said Paul Grewal, a Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel, in a blog post late Friday. When Facebook found out, it demanded Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy the data. Facebook said it received certifications they had complied.","Now there are allegations that not all the data had been destroyed.","Facebook's responsibility","In reaction to the controversy, Facebook's most senior executives have been trying to stress that Facebook was deceived. Kogan shouldn't have passed on the data, they said, and those involved shouldn't have lied about deleting all of it.","\"[Kogan] lied to those users and he lied to Facebook about what he was using the data for,\" Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a now-deleted tweet.","But the dustup raises questions about Facebook's responsibility in all of this. Facebook's trove of data on its 2 billion monthly users is a powerful tool. It helps millions of people connect with one another, while also helping advertisers send targeted ads based on what people put in their profiles.","To what extent is Facebook responsible for bad actors who abuse developer agreements? Could Facebook have done more to ensure the data had been destroyed -- beyond accepting certifications it was deleted? How can the social network try to make sure other developers don't pass on the data they collect to other parties?","Facebook didn't respond to a request for comment asking the company these questions.","Still, critics put the blame squarely on the social network. \"Facebook leaders think we are questioning their motives and sincerity. Hardly,\" tweeted Siva Vaidhyanathan, director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia. \"We are calling them out on their policies, actions, and their consequences.\"","Facebook leaders think we are questioning their motives and sincerity. Hardly. We are calling them out on their policies, actions, and their consequences.","For Facebook's part, Grewal said in his blog post that Facebook has made changes to how it deals with developers in the last five years. For example, the need to undergo an app review that requires them to justify collecting certain types of date.","A broader problem","What happened with Cambridge Analytica is just the latest in a growing list of ways Facebook's platform reportedly has been misused.","Malicious actors from propagandists to trolls have been abusing its systems for sometimes nefarious ends. The social network is still under fire for Russian trolls abusing Facebook with ads and organic posts to sow discord among Americans and influence the 2016 election.","Because of that, Facebook has drawn ire from lawmakers threatening to impose regulations on the social network and its advertising business. Last November, Facebook, along with Twitter and Google, sent their general counsels to hearings on Capitol Hill for a grilling from members of Congress.","The Cambridge Analytica incident has also raised the specter of regulation. \"We continue to keep an eye on the louder chatter coming out of regulators and politicians around Facebook's business model being used for improper means post the Russian meddling situation,\" Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, wrote in a note to investors Sunday.","Indeed, Congress has been quick to criticize Facebook. But this time lawmakers want answers straight from the top.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The concerns extend outside the US as well. On Monday, Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament, said that EU lawmakers will be launching an investigation.","\"Allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens' privacy rights. The European Parliament will investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account,\" Tajani tweeted.","Perhaps the most concerning part is that the Russians -- and now Cambridge Analytica -- didn't abuse Facebook by breaching its security. There were no passwords stolen, no systems hacked. Instead, they used Facebook's products exactly as they were built (though in the case of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, the rule-breaking allegedly came later).","Stamos and Andrew Bosworth, another top exec at Facebook who used to run its ads business, have been quick to point out the difference between data breach and service violation. Still, Bosworth acknowledged Facebook's responsibility to protect people from \"predatory behavior.\"","\"The distinction you're drawing between this infraction and a data breach is meaningful from your perspective, but not from ours,\" a Twitter user named Evan Baily replied to a Bosworth tweet. \"Facebook's platform must protect us from predatory behavior or we can't and shouldn't trust the platform.\"","Originally published March 18 at 11:53 a.m. PT.Updated March 18 at 3:48 p.m. PT: Added comment from an analyst note about regulation.Updated March 19 at 5:23 a.m. PT: Added comment from European Parliament President Antonio Tajani."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Honestly we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately. We thought we were doing something that was really normal.”","Last week Facebook announced it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further investigation over misuse of data. Facebook insists Kogan violated its platform policy by transferring data his app collected to Cambridge Analytica. It also said he had specifically assured Facebook that the data would never be used for commercial purposes.","Kogan said the scandal raised questions about the business model of social networking companies. Kogan said: “The project that Cambridge Analytica has allegedly done, which is use people’s Facebook data for micro-targeting, is the primary use case for most data on these platforms. Facebook and Twitter and other platforms make their money through advertising and so there’s an agreement between the user of ‘hey, you will get this amazing product that costs billions of dollars to run and in return we can sell you to advertisers for micro-targeting’.”","Are you leaving Facebook? Share your concerns on privacy with us","Read more","Kogan also disputed Cambridge Analytica’s claim that he had approached them with the idea.","He said: “That is a fabrication. They approached me; in terms of the usage of Facebook data they wrote the terms of service for the app. They provided the legal advice that this was all appropriate. So I’m definitely surprised by their comments and I don’t think they are accurate.”","He pointed out that it paid up to $800,000 to recruit about 200,000 people to use it. He said: “I have never profited from this in anyway personally. This money was paid mostly … for the participants – each person was paid $3 to $4 (£2.10 to £2.80), so that’s where really the money went.”","Kogan said he was told that the scheme was legal but accepts he should have questioned the ethics of the exercise.","He said: “They [Cambridge Analytica] communicated that this would be a fully commercial project and that terms of service would be ones that allowed a broad licence for usage. What was communicated to me strongly is that thousands and maybe tens of thousands of apps were doing the exact same thing. And this was a pretty normal use case of Facebook data.”","Cambridge Analytica denies using the Facebook data during the Trump campaign.","Kogan said: “We were assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was perfectly legal and within the limits of the terms of service. One of the great mistakes I did here was that I just didn’t ask enough questions.","While at Cambridge Kogan accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research.","Kogan laughed off suspicions that he is linked to the Kremlin. He said: “This one is pretty funny … anyone who knows me knows I’m a very happy-go-lucky goofy guy, the last one to have any real links to espionage.”","Wylie claims most of the personal information harvested by Kogan’s app had been taken without authorisation. He said Cambridge Analytica used it to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","Kogan said he had no knowledge of how the information was subsequently used. He said he would feel “horrible” if the data had helped influence the election. “Mr Trump is not somebody whose values align well with mine,” he said.","He also doubts it could have been useful. Kogan, who works at Cambridge University’s psychology department, said: “The accuracy of this data has been extremely exaggerated. In practice my best guess is that we were six times more likely to get everything wrong about a person as we were to get everything right about a person. I personally don’t think micro-targeting is an effective way to use such data sets.","“It could have only hurt the campaign. What Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic. And it made claims that this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you, but the reality is that it’s not that. If you really work through the statistics … those claims quickly fall apart.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, who was suspended on Tuesday, told MPs in February that his company did not use Facebook data in its work.","In a statement published on Saturday, the company denied any wrongdoing and said it did not harvest Facebook data, and none was used in the 2016 presidential election. It said it fully complied with Facebook’s terms of service and it had deleted all the data it received from Kogan’s company."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, Associated Press","State and federal officials turned up the heat on Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday as they sought answers about the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal.","California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and his counterparts in 36 states and territories sent a letter to Zuckerberg saying revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, obtained information on more than 50 million Facebook members raised “many serious” questions that the Menlo Park company needed to answer.","Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Zuckerberg, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter, to Capitol Hill on April 10 to “discuss Facebook’s past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data.”","And the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that the agency has opened an investigation of Facebook, possibly including whether the company violated a 2011 settlement relating to data privacy.","Monday’s developments intensified what analyst Daniel Ives called the “hurricane-like storm” swirling over Facebook since the disclosure about the data obtained by Britain’s Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.","“This has just created more worries around the ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ week that Facebook and Zuckerberg encountered,” said Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights.","On Sunday, Facebook took out ads in major newspapers apologizing for the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But the apologies weren’t enough for Becerra, who joined a long list that included attorneys general from Oregon, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, D.C, Hawaii, Guam and American Samoa.","“Facebook has made promises about users’ privacy in the past, and we need to know that users can trust Facebook,” the letter from the attorneys general said. “With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Will Castleberry, Facebook’s vice president for state and local public policy, said in a statement that “attorneys general across the country have raised important questions and we appreciate their interest. Our internal review of the situation continues and we look forward to responding.”","The letter asked the company for an update “about how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy” because its members still don’t know their personal data is available to third-party companies.","Cook County, the Illinois County that includes Chicago, filed a suit Friday claiming Facebook and Cambridge Analytica violated that state’s consumer fraud and deceptive business practices laws.","Facebook stock posted a slight gain in trading Monday, although the overall market surged. The stock price initially slumped after the FTC confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook’s privacy practices.","Tom Pahl, the FTC’s acting director of consumer protection, issued a statement saying that the agency is probing whether the company has engaged in “unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers.”","Pahl noted that in 2011, Facebook agreed to a settlement of an FTC complaint about its use of users’ information. The commission said the company deceived consumers by failing to keep promises to protect the privacy rights of its then-800 million members. Facebook now has more than 2 billion members.","Reports surfaced last week that the FTC had started an investigation, but the agency did not confirm the probe until Pahl issued his statement.","“Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,” Pahl said. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”","Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, said in a statement, “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","The 2011 action settled an eight-count FTC complaint citing Facebook for privacy violations that occurred between October 2008 and May 2010. One complaint cited Facebook for allowing third-party apps access to more personal data than they needed.","“Facebook represented that third-party apps that users installed would have access only to user information that they needed to operate,” the FTC said. “In fact, the apps could access nearly all of users’ personal data — data the apps didn’t need.”","Facebook, which in 2011 had not yet become a public company, agreed to tighten its privacy controls and submit to an independent audit every two years for the next 20 years. Jon Leibowitz, then chairman of the FTC, said that future violations of the terms of the settlement would carry a fine of up to $16,000 per day per violation.","When asked about those audits, an FTC spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Pahl’s statement.","The Electronic Privacy Information Center complained that the case showed the FTC “failed” to enforce the settlement to prevent incidents like Cambridge Analytica from occurring.","Bart Lazar, a privacy attorney with Seyfarth Shaw in Chicago, said the FTC may have difficulty finding that Facebook was liable for the actions of a third party.","“I suppose the FTC could craft an argument that’s based on the fact that Facebook knew or should have known what was going on with respect to the use of the data,” Lazar said. He also said the U.S. does not have a baseline law covering privacy protections, “just a hodgepodge of federal and state laws.”","And if the FTC finds there were violations, determining the amount of civil penalties Facebook could have to pay could depend on whether the violations apply to each of the 50 million members whose data was misused or to just one instance of Cambridge Analytica misusing the data, Lazar said.","Besides Grassley, several House and Senate members have invited Zuckerberg to testify before various committees. Grassley, however, scheduled a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, specifically to discuss privacy standards and data use.","Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss the future of social media data privacy and developing “rules of the road.”","Facebook confirmed the company received the invitation, but did not say whether Zuckerberg would accept. Google declined to comment, while Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said over the weekend at a conference in Beijing that “well-crafted” regulations may be needed to govern data privacy."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization in recent weeks to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known instance of the special counsel demanding records directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.","The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that encompasses Mr. Trump’s business ventures. Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over records related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the people said.","The subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump’s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will continue for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena came as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his inquiry to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump’s political activities. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses, including an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, about the flow of Emirati money into the United States.","The Trump Organization has typically complied with requests from congressional investigators for documents for their own inquiries into Russian election interference, and there was no indication the company planned to fight Mr. Mueller’s order.","“Since July 2017, we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations, including the special counsel, and is responding to their requests,” said Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer representing the Trump Organization. “This is old news and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.”","The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated during her daily briefing that the president was cooperating with the special counsel inquiry and referred further questions to the Trump Organization.","There are few other publicly known examples of Mr. Mueller using subpoenas. In January, he ordered the president’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, to appear before a grand jury. Mr. Mueller dropped the subpoena after Mr. Bannon agreed to be interviewed by investigators.","Mr. Mueller could run afoul of a line the president has warned him not to cross. Though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to Mr. Trump’s business outside ties to Russia, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The president declined to say how he would respond if he concluded that the special counsel had crossed that line.","Mr. Trump campaigned as a businessman whose deal-making prowess would translate directly into reforming Washington. The argument helped propel him to the White House, but the Trump Organization has been a magnet for criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs and some Republicans, who expressed concern that he remained vulnerable to conflicts of interest because he did not separate from the company.","Before Mr. Trump was sworn in, he pledged that he would stay uninvolved in his businesses while in office but insisted it would be too punitive for his business partners for him to divest from the company altogether.","Among the Trump Organization’s holdings are golf clubs, hotels and licensing agreements for the use of the Trump name on properties and other products. While its holdings are complex, the company has always been run like a small, family-owned business; Mr. Trump brought in his three eldest children to help run the enterprise.","The Trump Organization is not publicly held, making it difficult to determine where it receives its money and invests it. The company has said that it never had real estate holdings in Russia, but witnesses recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in Moscow.","In 2015, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s, Felix Sater, emailed Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, at his Trump Organization account claiming he had ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would help Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Mr. Trump signed a nonbinding letter of intent for the project in 2015 and discussed it at least three times with Mr. Cohen.","A revealing comment about Russia by Eric Trump, the president’s middle son, also drew scrutiny when it emerged last year. James Dodson, a longtime golf writer from North Carolina, said offhand in a radio interview that Eric Trump, who oversees the golf courses for the Trump Organization, told him in 2013 that the Trumps relied on Russian investors to back their golf clubs. Eric Trump has denied those remarks.","Mr. Mueller was appointed in May to investigate whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 election and any other matters that may arise from the inquiry.","A month later, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit after Mr. Trump asked him to have Mr. Mueller fired because the president believed he had conflict-of-interest issues that precluded him from running the special counsel investigation.","Mr. Mueller is also examining whether the president has tried to obstruct the investigation.","Mr. Trump’s lawyers are in negotiations with Mr. Mueller’s office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. Mr. Mueller’s office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president, according to two people familiar with the talks. The lawyers have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview, but the president has said he wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators’ questions.","At the same time, Mr. Trump is considering whether to bring on a new lawyer to help represent him in the special counsel’s investigation. Last week, Mr. Trump spoke with Emmet T. Flood, a longtime Washington lawyer who represented former President Bill Clinton during the impeachment process, about coming into the White House to deal with the inquiry.","Michael S.

I began to lose confidence in Facebook the first time I saw a photograph on Facebook of a woman beheaded for her choice to wear Western dress.","I used to work in digital forensics. You see some unpleasant things there. No, don't ask: I don't want to talk about it: it's enough to say that yes, I'm someone who has actual work experience in watching people get beheaded.","When Facebook begins to look like work, it's time for you to hit that 'Report' button. I did so, thinking this decapitation photograph was so beyond the pale that Facebook would of course delist it. A few hours later I received a nice note thanking me for bringing it to Facebook's attention but as it didn't violate any terms or conditions no further action would be taken. Facebook suggested I block the source instead.","My reaction to this was, as my friends can tell you, volcanic.","I did a little more digging. (It's generally unwise to make a forensics nerd pissed off and curious.) I discovered what was probably happening: the web server was delivering different content to different user agents. If you visited that site with a browser you weren't served any offensive content: if you pretended to be a robot, you got some really foul stuff. So apparently, this website was serving foul stuff to Facebook's automated system for purposes of showing up in people's newsfeeds, but if a Facebook content examiner visited the site (i.e., followed up on my report) they'd see nothing offensive.","It was then that I knew people were gaming Facebook and could do so in dangerous ways.","I reached out to a friend of mine who's in a senior engineering position at Facebook. He's a good man, an honest man. We kicked it around for a while and determined I probably had the right interpretation of things. He reported this on to whatever the proper reporting chain is within Facebook.","I waited to see my ticket get re-opened and for someone at Facebook to send me a note. I wasn't expecting anything over-the-top, just a \"We've given your report a second look and have concluded we dismissed your complaint incorrectly.\" That's all.","But nothing happened.","That was when I realized Facebook really was not a good company. It has some very nice people there; I know enough Facebook employees to believe their rank-and-file people genuinely want to create a safe social environment.","But I don't believe the Facebook corporation is nice at all.","Today I work in the CNO space. I am, among other things, an instructor of CNO. One of the first lessons I teach people is the importance of realizing the internet is not a solitary place. If you catch one intruder in a system, look hard and look twice for the other dozen intrusions you didn't spot. You didn't catch the first person who entered your system: you caught the Nth. Now you need to find all N-1 who came before.","Anything posted on the internet (including all wide visibility G+ comments such as these) are a digital trail guaranteed to being scraped and cross-indexed by multiple competing shady parties. There are virtually no consequences to doing so. By the time anyone gets around to shutting something like that down legally, if even possible, you have to assume the data has already been reshared, sold, and abused. That can't be undone.","+Cliff Bramlett I do not recommend G Suite (aka Google for Work aka Google Apps for Your Domain) for individual or family use. Stick with normal consumer Google accounts. G Suite is tailored to businesses and schools only these days and unlikely to change. Individual small users have a bad experience (says I, posting from my one user G Suite account that I regret tying myself to but don't feel like undoing).","You can route all email at your own domains into Gmail or whomever else via various MX services and have regular Gmail send from those domains.","One of the books I wrote was \"Web Security Field Guide\". Sort of a cookbook on hardening a system. In that I mentioned that if you are examining a series of servers and one is already well hardened, look even more closely. Then (now too??) it was commonplace for intruders to harden the servers they compromised in order to keep other intruders out. They knew that if too many of them hit the same machine, they'd collectively slow it down and draw attention.","Security is a three legged stool. OS security. Application security. Physical security. You can't shortchange any one of them. If you're using insecure applications (e.g., SCADA systems) or an insecure OS (windows XP or 7, or even poorly configured linux) or you don't physically segregate and lock down your devices you have to assume you're compromised."],"isopubdate":""}

The tech company holding that title in 2018 is Facebook.","Much like Uber, which started off 2017 weathering a #deleteUber campaign over its action during President Trump's travel ban, Facebook is dealing with its own scandal and calls by users to drop the service.","Late last week, Facebook admitted it knew, but didn't notify users, that political intelligence firm Cambridge Analytica had obtained data on hundreds of thousands of Facebook users without their consent. It made this disclosure on the eve of investigative articles in the New York Timesand The Guardian's The Observer, which detailed a scheme by the Trump campaign-linked firm to tap likes and posts from tens of millions of unwitting users to predict how they would vote.","Backlash against the abuse of user privacy was swift, with regulators, privacy experts and lawmakers calling for tighter regulations, investigations and company executives to step up.","The Cambridge Analytica scandal is the latest in what has been a rough year for Facebook. Here's a recap:","January 11: Facebook unveils significant changes to its News Feed aimed at bumping up social interactions between friends and family over news articles, videos, or what they consider passive engagement. The overhaul came in response to increasing pressure Facebook endures over its potentially negative impact on society, from sharing violent videos to letting fake news run unchecked to its late acknowledgement that Russian operatives had used to platform to target U.S. voters.","January 23: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said Facebook should face regulations compared to cigarette companies for its addictive properties. \"Technology has addictive qualities that we have to address, and that product designers are working to make those products more addictive and we need to rein that back,\" Benioff told CNBC.","January 31: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed a drop in the time users spent on the platform following big changes its to News Feed. During Facebook's fourth quarter earnings call, he said it amounted to users spending 50 million fewer hours each day.","February 5: Former employees of Facebook and Google help launch the education campaign The Truth About Tech to explore tech addiction and the mental health consequences of using social media. \"They've created the attention economy and are now engaged in a full-blown arms race to capture and retain human attention, including the attention of kids,\" said former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris.","February 16: Facebook moves forward with its Messenger Kids app despite calls from critics to shut it down for attempting to pull kids toward its services at too young an age. The app is targeted to kids under 13 and lets parents approve who their kids message.","February 18: More than a quarter of Americans in a recent online survey said Facebook should receive a fine for its role in Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election.","March 5: Facebook comes under fire for a user survey which asked whether pedophiles should be able to proposition underage girls for sexually explicit photographs on the service. \"It shouldn't have been part of this survey,\" said Guy Rosen, a vice president of product for Facebook.","March 14: The Federal Election Commission said it would start writing new disclosure rules for online ads in response to revelations Russian interests bought content on Facebook and other platforms in an attempt to meddle with the 2016 election.","March 17: One day after Facebook announced it had suspended Cambridge Analytica for improper access to user data, The New York Times and The Observer said the political consultancy had access to 50 million profiles and used them to target ads during the 2016 election. Facebook said it knew Cambridge had violated its policies by obtaining the data, which users had agreed to share with a personality prediction app that then, secretly, passed them on.","Facebook defended keeping users in the dark by saying it had thought Cambridge had deleted the data — and because it didn't qualify as a data breach, since users had agreed to share their data with the quiz app. That response didn't sit well with lawmakers, regulators and privacy activists.","March 19: Democrat Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal called for hearings into the situation and for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. Then three Republican Senators send a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg demanding questions about the privacy breach answered, in writing. The calls echo lawmaker demands in other parts of the world. Shares dropped 7%, the worst drop in four years.","March 21: Zuckerberg breaks his silence, pledging to fix the \"breach of trust\" created by the scandal. \"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,\" he wrote on a Facebook post. \"I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community.\" In a series of interviews, Zuckerberg also suggested he would be willing to testify before Congress.","April 8. Facebook suspended a data analytics firm called CubeYou after learning it was collecting information on users through quizzes. According to CNBC, CubeYou misleadingly labeled the quizzes then shared the data with marketers.","April 8. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is among the high-profile Facebook users who plan to quit the service. \"Apple makes its money off of good products, not off of you,\" Wozniak said. \"As they say, with Facebook, you are the product.\"","April 11-12.

{"originalurl":"https://www.kefron.com/blog/consent-right-forgotten-will-gdpr-affect-data-capture/","title":"The Right to be Forgotten: How will the GDPR affect data capture?","text":["When the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation comes into full effect and enforcement in May 2018, businesses both in Europe and those who engage with European customers will face sweeping new requirements on data capture and data erasure.","The GDPR will dramatically change the rights of the data subject and how data will be processed. Does your business have a strategy in place to avoid breaching the new regulations?","Getting consent for data capture","Perhaps the largest initial impact will be felt in regards to how your company will be able to capture data lawfully with this new legislation. Data capture is an integral part of almost every – if not all – marketing strategies for businesses of all shapes and sizes. However, the GDPR places strong requirements on what exactly ‘consent’ means with regards to data capture.","Whilst the general idea of getting consent from users remains intact, the GDPR adds new restrictions as to how this consent can be sought and achieved. Although it stops just short of requiring full and explicit consent, the legislation certainly leans more in favour of this side of the spectrum, indicating that consent can only be given through “a statement or a clear affirmative action.”","Specifically, recital (32) states:","Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her…","Each time you request data, consent is required too, in particular if you plan to process that data for different purposes. A single consent does not cover all instances of data capture, and explanations of planned data processes must be given when requesting consent in order to comply with GDPR regulations.","The new legislation also adds further requirements of parental authorisation for data capture concerning children under the age of 13, whilst special categories of personal data – such as ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political affiliations, medical information and sexual orientation – will all require further explicit consent.","What will you have to change?","With the GDPR, businesses will no longer be able to rely on opt-out processes or implicit consent. Under the eyes of the law, inaction on the part of a user does not assume consent to their data being captured.","In fact, the legislation specifically refers to this, describing how “silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.”","For companies, this might mean an overhaul of sign up forms and the whole process of data capture in your business. Clear, plain language needs to be used every time you are requesting data from your customers, which is simple to access, simple to read and simple to understand. This includes an explanation of how you will lawfully process their data.","How you actually gain that consent is still open to interpretation, but could include:","A written statement – including by electronic means","An oral statement","The ticking of a box on a website","Choosing technical settings for information society services","This last option given in the GDPR could see the use of cookies and tracking technology remaining intact, as it’s open to wide interpretation. However, it’s also worth noting that unless data processing is required for a specific service, businesses cannot supply or deny this service to users based upon the need to consent to data capture.","As an extreme example, that would mean you couldn’t stop a user from reading content on a website page unless they consented to data capture of their personal details.","It’s important to also remember that consent should be verifiable, so data controllers will need to keep detailed records to prove a user has ‘opted-in’ and consented.","If you already have consent for data capture based on previous EU directives, you won’t need to re-seek this consent as long as it meets the new requirements laid out in the GDPR.","Given these sweeping changes, it’s likely that businesses will need to conduct a full review of their data capture mechanisms and electronic content management systems in order to ensure compliance. To stay on the right side of the law, companies will need to:","Get valid consent for use of any personal data, with an affirmative act by the subject","Explain how and why data will be processed in any given circumstance","Re-obtain consent if the processing methods change or use of that data alters","Provide records of consent and access to the data that has been captured upon request","Withdrawing consent and the right to be forgotten","As well as new requirements on gaining consent for data capture and processing, the GDPR also makes it clear that consent can be withdrawn and revoked at any time.","Originally known as the ‘right to be forgotten’, broadly speaking this principle dictates that an individual can request for their data to be removed or deleted when there is no compelling reason for a business to continue processing that information. Though initially more absolute, the GDPR legislation has been watered down and termed ‘the right to erasure.’","Entrenched in Article 17 of the GDPR, the right to erasure states that in certain circumstances,an individual can submit a request to the data controller to have personal information erased or to prevent further processing of that data. The right to erasure applies when:","The personal data is no longer necessary or relevant in relation to the purpose for which it was original collected","The individual specifically withdraws consent to processing (and if there is no other justification or legitimate interest for continued processing)","Personal data has been unlawfully processed, in breach of the GDPR","The data must be erased in order for a controller to comply with legal obligations (for example, the deletion of certain data after a set period of time)","If one of the above conditions applies under this right to erasure, it is the responsibility of the data controller to delete and remove the data ‘without undue delay’ and specifically within a month unless specific circumstances apply.","In instances where personal data has been shared with other third parties or made available in the public domain, the GDPR states that it is the data controller’s responsibility to take ‘all reasonable steps’ to inform other outlets of the request for erasure and require them to comply with deletion or removal.","However, what those ‘reasonable steps’ are is ambiguous and open to interpretation. It will depend on available technology and the cost of implementation. If data has been made public for example, it could be extremely difficult to identify and inform additional data controllers and impossible to trace all its current uses.","Complying with and balancing the right to erasure","Despite the reach of the GDPR, it does note that the right to erasure isn’t absolute and nor is it unlimited. The removal or deletion of data, and that aforementioned ‘right to be forgotten’ needs to be balanced against freedom of information and the public interest.","The exceptions to the right to erasure and reasons to refuse to comply include:","The right of freedom of expression and information","Compliance with legal obligations or official authorities","Public health reasons or the performance of a public interest task","Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research, historic research or statistical analysis","If needed for the exercise or defence of legal claims","In some cases, the restriction of personal data may be more applicable, and this could be used an alternative option to erasure or in circumstances where data must be held in limbo pending legal challenges.","The biggest challenge concerning the right to erasure is that the onus is on controllers to weigh up this request with other competing rights and interests. In effect, data controllers will be required to be judge and jury, with any mishandling of requests sitting on their shoulders.","Preparing for the effects of GDPR","The key for businesses is to review all data capture and processes now, before the new GDPR legislation comes into full force, in order to allow time to make any required changes.","Consent for data needs to be bullet proof to avoid any legal challenges and non-compliance. Staff also needs to be well trained to identify requests for the ‘right to erasure’ and deal with them appropriately.","New systems and processes may need to be put in place, whilst data controllers need to constantly keep an eye on the new legislation and exemptions made by Member States of the EU.","Different sectors will be affected in different ways, so much research will be required along with a significant ‘bedding in’ period, before the full ramifications of the GDPR on data capture are clear.","Is your business ready for the GDPR?

Cook County is Illinois’ most populous county and the second-largest county by population in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017.","The suit seeks $50,000 for each violation of the law, plus an additional $10,000 for each violation involving an Illinois resident who is at least 65 years old. Cook County is represented in the suit by the Edelson law firm.","Ars Technica reports that six other cases are pending in federal court, while the Tribune says there are at least five pending federal lawsuits. Suits have claimed violations of user privacy and breaches of duties to shareholders. The Federal Trade Commission is also investigating.","The lawsuits followed a report by the New York Times and the Observer of London that said Cambridge Analytica acquired the information from a researcher who told Facebook he was using the information for academic purposes.","According to the Cook County suit, the Cambridge Analytica researcher collected information from about 270,000 American voters who downloaded an app and took a personality quiz. The company then acquired information about the 270,000 people from Facebook as well as information about all of their friends, amounting to a “data grab of 40 million users,” the suit says.","When Facebook learned the information was being used in elections, the company asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, but didn’t confirm that it actually happened, according to news coverage.","Cambridge Analytica used its information to identify “the most persuadable voters” and to target them with fake news during the 2016 presidential campaign, the suit says. The company had worked on Donald Trump’s campaign.","According to the Washington Post and the Times, election lawyer Laurence Levy of Bracewell & Giuliani had warned Cambridge Analytica against allowing noncitizens to provide high-level advice to candidates, pointing to laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in U.S. elections. Yet dozens of noncitizens provided advice to Republican candidates in 2014, according to the articles."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Obama was serving his first term as president. Google+ hadn’t arrived, let alone vanished again. Steve Jobs was still alive, as was Kim Jong Il. Facebook’s IPO hadn’t yet taken place, and its service was still fun to use—although it was littered with requests and demands from social games, like FarmVille and Pet Society.","I’d had enough of it—the click-farming games, for one, but also Facebook itself. Already in 2010, it felt like a malicious attention market where people treated friends as latent resources to be optimized. Compulsion rather than choice devoured people’s time. Apps like FarmVille sold relief for the artificial inconveniences they themselves had imposed.","In response, I made a satirical social game called Cow Clicker. Players clicked a cute cow, which mooed and scored a “click.” Six hours later, they could do so again. They could also invite friends’ cows to their pasture, buy virtual cows with real money, compete for status, click to send a real cow to the developing world from Oxfam, outsource clicks to their toddlers with a mobile app, and much more. It became strangely popular, until eventually, I shut the whole thing down in a bovine rapture—the “cowpocalypse.” It’s kind of a complicated story.","But one worth revisiting today, in the context of the scandal over Facebook’s sanctioning of user-data exfiltration via its application platform. It’s not just that abusing the Facebook platform for deliberately nefarious ends was easy to do (it was). But worse, in those days, it was hard to avoid extracting private data, for years even, without even trying. I did it with a silly cow game.","* * *","Cow Clicker is not an impressive work of software. After all, it was a game whose sole activity was clicking on cows. I wrote the principal code in three days, much of it hunched on a friend’s couch in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I had no idea anyone would play it, although over 180,000 people did, eventually. I made a little money from the whole affair, but I never optimized it for revenue generation. I certainly never pondered using the app as a lure for a data-extraction con. I was just a strange man making a strange game on a lark.","And yet, if you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior. I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood, before my caprice raptured them into the digital void.","The authorization dialog for the game Candy Crush. (King / Facebook)","To understand why withdrawing data was the default behavior in Facebook apps, you have to know something about how apps get made and published on Facebook. In 2007, the company turned its social-network service into an application platform. The idea was that Facebook could grow its number of users and the time they spent engaged by allowing people and organizations to build services overtop of it. And those people and organizations would benefit by plugging into a large network of users, whose network of friends could easily be made a part of the service, both for social interaction and viral spread.","When you access an app on Facebook’s website, be it a personality-quiz, a game, a horoscope, or a sports community, the service presents you with an authorization dialog, where the specific data an app says it needs is displayed for the user’s consideration. That could be anything from your name, friend list, and email address, to your photos, likes, direct messages and more.","The information shared with an app by default has changed over time, and even a savvy user might never have known what comprised it. When I launched Cow Clicker in 2010, it was easier to acquire both “basic” information (name, gender, networks, and profile picture) and “extended” user information (location, relationship status, likes, posts, and more). In 2014, Facebook began an app review process for information beyond that which a user shared publicly, but for years before that, the decision was left to the user alone. This is consistent with Facebook’s longstanding, official policy on privacy, which revolves around user control rather than procedural verification.","App authorizations are not exceptionally clear. For one thing, the user must accept the app’s request to share data with it as soon as they open it for the first time, even before knowing what the app does or why. For another, the authorization is presented by Facebook, not by the third party, making it seem official, safe, and even endorsed.","Cow Clicker on Facebook, 2010. The game appears to live natively inside the Facebook interface, but it runs—and stores its data—on a separate server. (Cow Clicker / Ian Bogost / The Atlantic)","The part of the Facebook website where apps appear, under the blue top navigation (as seen above), introduces further confusion. To the average web user, especially a decade ago, it looked like the game or app was just a part of Facebook itself. The page is seamless, with no boundary between the site’s navigational chrome and the third-party app. If you look at the browser address bar while using a Facebook app on the website, the URL begins with “apps.facebook.com,” further cementing the impression that the user was safely ensconced in the comforting, blue cradle of Facebook’s care.","That’s not what really takes place. When a user loads an app, Facebook’s servers pass those requests to a remote computer, where the individual or company that made the app hosts their services. The app sends its responses to Facebook, which formats and presents them to the user, as if they were inside of Facebook itself.","The authorization process happens once, the first time the app is accessed for a specific user. After that, every time the user loads the app, Facebook sends it a payload of basic user data to facilitate the app’s operation (additional data can be requested separately when needed). For years, these transmissions were even conducted unencrypted, until Facebook required apps to communicate with its service over a secure connection.","Beyond its own terms of service for applications, which many developers probably didn’t read or feel compelled to heed, Facebook “secured” user data shared with third-parties by requiring every app to publish a privacy policy. Because data sharing was seen as a form of user-control, not corporate policy, Facebook doesn’t appear to review platform-developer privacy policies. As far as I can tell, all the platform did was to insure that accessing the URL for an app’s privacy policy didn’t result in a page-not-found error. Facebook was checking that privacy policies existed as reachable web pages, not that they existed as privacy policies, let alone policies that provided any specific protections. And besides, users probably never read the policies, which were linked unassumingly from the application-permissions interface. They might easily, and reasonably, have assumed that Facebook was simply reiterating its own privacy policy when presenting new access to an app. They would have been wrong.","In essence, Facebook was presenting apps as quasi-endorsed extensions of its core service to users who couldn’t have been expected to know better. That might explain why so many people feel violated by Facebook this week—they might never have realized that they were even using foreign, non-Facebook applications in the first place, let alone ones that were siphoning off and selling their data. The website always just looked like Facebook.","In the case of Cow Clicker, which only ever aimed to let people click on pictures of cows, I was able to access two potentially sensitive pieces of data without even trying.","The first is a player’s Facebook ID. This is a numeric, unique identifier attached to every Facebook account. Once I have your Facebook ID, I can look up your profile programmatically, or I can just load it in the public website by appending it to “facebook.com”—Mark Zuckerberg’s is 4.","These days, Facebook generates a unique, app-specific ID for each user, in order to prevent an app from connecting someone directly to Facebook profiles. But back in Cow Clicker’s heyday of 2010, Facebook didn’t do this, and every app got your actual ID. Those data could be correlated against other information—data collected from Facebook, fashioned by the app, or acquired elsewhere. Because I collected and stored my users’ true Facebook IDs to be able to count their clicks and build their pastures and the like, I still have them, and, in theory, I could use them nefariously. A 2014 terms-of-service update prohibits some of that activity, but not everyone cares about violating the Facebook terms of service.","The second type of information is a piece of profile data Cow Clicker received without asking for it. Back in 2010, Facebook still allowed users to join “networks”—affiliations like schools, workplaces, and organizations. In some cases, those affiliations required authorization, for example having an email address at a domain that corresponds with a university. Over time, verification became less important to Facebook, and now users can affiliate with schools or workplaces arbitrarily. The less friction, the more data.","In 2010, on my friend’s couch in Brooklyn, I noticed that Facebook was shipping user affiliation data over the wire to me, so I decided to store it. Facebook allowed apps to store data for which user permission was granted, but urged developers not to request or store more than it needed to operate. Putting affiliation data in the Cow Clicker database allowed me to provide leaderboard rankings by network, allowing my players to compete for clicks with their work colleagues or classmates.","That’s neither a terribly interesting feature nor a particularly wicked one. But because I stored the numerical identifiers for user affiliations, I still have them. Until 2016, I could use a database-query tool called FQL, Facebook Query Language, to retrieve the details of those networks, and correlate them back to my users. Had I wanted to, I could have recombined that information with other data and used it for retargeting.","Cow Clicker’s example is so modest, it might not even seem like a problem. What does it matter if a simple diversion has your Facebook ID, education, and work affiliations? Especially since its solo creator (that’s me) was too dumb or too lazy to exploit that data toward pernicious ends. But even if I hadn’t thought about it at the time, I could have done so years later, long after the cows vanished, and once Cow Clicker players forgot that they’d ever installed my app.","This is also why Zuckerberg’s response to the present controversy feels so toothless. Facebook has vowed to audit companies that have collected, shared, or sold large volumes of data in violation of its policy, but the company cannot close the Pandora’s box it opened a decade ago, when it first allowed external apps to collect Facebook user data. That information is now in the hands of thousands, maybe millions of people.","To be honest, I’m not even sure I know what the Facebook platform’s terms of service dictated that I do with user data acquired from Facebook. Technically, users could revoke certain app permissions later, and apps were supposed to remove any impacted data that they had stored. I doubt most apps did that, and I suspect users never knew—and still don’t know—that revoking access to an app they used eight years ago doesn’t do anything to reverse transmissions that took place years ago.","As Jason Koebler put it at Motherboard, it’s too late. “If your data has already been taken, Facebook has no mechanism and no power to make people delete it. If your data was taken, it has very likely been sold, laundered, and put back into Facebook.” Indeed, all the publicity around Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica crisis might be sending lots of old app developers, like me, back to old code and dusty databases, wondering what they’ve even got stored and what it might yet be worth.","Facebook’s laissez-faire openness surely contributed to the data-extraction free-for-all that’s playing itself out now via the example of Cambridge Analytica. But so did its move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development. The Facebook platform was truly a nightmare to use and to maintain. It was built like no other software system then extant, and it changed constantly—regular updates rolled out weekly. Old code broke, seemingly for no good reason. Some Facebook app developers were dishonest from the start, and others couldn’t help themselves once they saw the enormous volume of data they could slurp from millions or tens of millions of Facebook users. But many more were just struggling to eke out a part of their living in an ecosystem where people might discover them.","Millions of apps had been created by 2012, when I hung up my cowboy hat. Not only apps apparently designed with duplicity in mind, like Aleksandr Kogan’s personality-quiz, which extracted data that was then sold to Cambridge Analytica. But hundreds of thousands of creators of dumb toys, quizzes, games, and communities that might never have intended to dupe or violate users surely did so anyway, because Facebook rammed their data down our throats. On the whole, none of us asked for your data. But we have it anyway, and forever.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated.","In the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants.","Still, new computer screenshots released by the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday made clear that Russian state hackers had the foothold they would have needed to manipulate or shut down power plants.","“We now have evidence they’re sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage,” said Eric Chien, a security technology director at Symantec, a digital security firm.","“From what we can see, they were there. They have the ability to shut the power off. All that’s missing is some political motivation,” Mr. Chien said.","It was the first time the administration officially named Russia as the perpetrator of the assaults. And it marked the third time in recent months that the White House, departing from its usual reluctance to publicly reveal intelligence, blamed foreign government forces for attacks on infrastructure in the United States.","But the penalties have been light. So far, Mr. Trump has said little to nothing about the Russian role in those attacks.","The groups that conducted the energy attacks, which are linked to Russian intelligence agencies, appear to be different from the two hacking groups that were involved in the election interference.","That would suggest that at least three separate Russian cyberoperations were underway simultaneously. One focused on stealing documents from the Democratic National Committee and other political groups. Another, by a St. Petersburg “troll farm” known as the Internet Research Agency, used social media to sow discord and division. A third effort sought to burrow into the infrastructure of American and European nations.","For years, American intelligence officials tracked a number of Russian state-sponsored hacking units as they successfully penetrated the computer networks of critical infrastructure operators across North America and Europe, including in Ukraine.","Some of the units worked inside Russia’s Federal Security Service, the K.G.B. successor known by its Russian acronym, F.S.B.; others were embedded in the Russian military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U. Still others were made up of Russian contractors working at the behest of Moscow.","Russian cyberattacks surged last year, starting three months after Mr. Trump took office.","American officials and private cybersecurity experts uncovered a series of Russian attacks aimed at the energy, water and aviation sectors and critical manufacturing, including nuclear plants, in the United States and Europe. In its urgent report in June, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. notified operators about the attacks but stopped short of identifying Russia as the culprit.","By then, Russian spies had compromised the business networks of several American energy, water and nuclear plants, mapping out their corporate structures and computer networks.","They included that of the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear plant near Burlington, Kan. But in that case, and those of other nuclear operators, Russian hackers had not leapt from the company’s business networks into the nuclear plant controls.","Forensic analysis suggested that Russian spies were looking for inroads — although it was not clear whether the goal was to conduct espionage or sabotage, or to trigger an explosion of some kind.","In a report made public in October, Symantec noted that a Russian hacking unit “appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so.”","The United States sometimes does the same thing. It bored deeply into Iran’s infrastructure before the 2015 nuclear accord, placing digital “implants” in systems that would enable it to bring down power grids, command-and-control systems and other infrastructure in case a conflict broke out. The operation was code-named “Nitro Zeus,” and its revelation made clear that getting into the critical infrastructure of adversaries is now a standard element of preparing for possible conflict.","The Russians have gone farther.","In an updated warning to utility companies on Thursday, Homeland Security officials included a screenshot taken by Russian operatives that proved they could now gain access to their victims’ critical controls.","Private security firms have tracked the Russian government assaults on Western power and energy operators — conducted alternately by groups under the names DragonFly, Energetic Bear and Berserk Bear — since 2011, when they first started targeting defense and aviation companies in the United States and Canada.","By 2013, researchers had tied the Russian hackers to hundreds of attacks on energy grid and oil and gas pipeline operators in the United States and Europe. Initially, the strikes appeared to be motivated by industrial espionage — a natural conclusion at the time, researchers said, given the importance of Russia’s oil and gas industry.","But by December 2015, the Russian hacks had taken an aggressive turn. The attacks were no longer aimed at intelligence gathering, but at potentially sabotaging or shutting down plant operations.","At Symantec, researchers discovered that Russian hackers had begun taking screenshots of the machinery used in energy and nuclear plants, and stealing detailed descriptions of how they operated — suggesting they were conducting reconnaissance for a future attack.","As the American government enacted the sanctions on Thursday, cybersecurity experts were still questioning where the Russian attacks could lead, given that the United States was sure to respond in kind.","“Russia certainly has the technical capability to do damage, as it demonstrated in the Ukraine,” said Eric Cornelius, a cybersecurity expert at Cylance, a private security firm, who previously assessed critical infrastructure threats for the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration.","“It is unclear what their perceived benefit would be from causing damage on U.S. soil, especially given the retaliation it would provoke,” Mr. Cornelius said.","Though a major step toward deterrence, publicly naming countries accused of cyberattacks still is unlikely to shame them into stopping. The United States is struggling to come up with proportionate responses to the wide variety of cyberespionage, vandalism and outright attacks.","Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, who has been nominated as director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, the military’s cyberunit, said during his Senate confirmation hearing this month that countries attacking the United States so far have little to worry about.","“I would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,” General Nakasone said. He later added, “They don’t fear us.”"],"isopubdate":"2282-10-07"}

Not just the devices and applications we use every day – we still love them – but the companies themselves. Many – if not most of us – thought FAGA were the good guys, helping everyone optimize digital opportunities and live more fulfilling personal and professional lives. After all, they’re the new economy, the platforms that enable our lives, and the tools we love to share. How many of us recruited customers for these tech giants without hesitation, apprehension, guilt – or compensation? We can’t imagine living without FAGA! That’s love.","We loved everything about them, their leadership, their logos, their stores, their products and even their style. Always there, always cool. We looked the other way when critics pointed to offshore manufacturing, controversial labor practices, fake news, ruthless price wars, offshore cash and even questions about planned obsolescence. Love is blind.","The Bloom Is Off The Rose","What happened? We realized that maybe, just maybe, FAGA were no different from car companies, real estate brokerages, banks, insurance companies, big pharma and other technology companies – those guys. When FAGA joined the family of “regular” companies they lost some appeal. In fact, if the trend continues, FAGA might even find themselves on the list of some of the most disrespected companies! One of the companies already made the wrong list (#6, behind Wells Fargo and just ahead of Spirit [Comcast was #1]): “Facebook has been a boon for shareholders since its IPO … however, not everyone is pleased with the social media platform. In recent years, the company has drawn significant criticism over its privacy policies and the mass data collection of its users. According to the company’s statements, Facebook collects data on nearly anything it can, including who its users communicate with, users’ financial transactions, and the types of devices users are connecting with … recently, the company faced sharp criticism for not doing enough to curb the spread of fake news leading up to the U.S. presidential election.”","Then we realized that information isn’t always helpful when it’s actually disinformation. We realized that “fake” could be purchased by anyone (on the platforms that enable our lives), including foreign adversaries committed to destabilizing the United States. Facebook and Google distribute information and disinformation without distinguishing nearly enough between the two. We also realized just how much money FAGA stashed outside the US to avoid paying US taxes. While the 2017 tax act may help bring some of that money back, what – many have asked – was it doing there in the first place, especially given the revenue FAGA generate from Americans? 2017 made it clear that FAGA exists for their shareholders, partners, executives and customers, in that order. What an awakening for even the love-is-blind crowd: just say it ain’t so! Just another company?","We realized – finally – there’s huge tech consolidation right under our noses. A few companies – including the FAGA team – control most everything digital. This makes us think a little differently about the role these companies play in our lives, especially when one of them wants $1,000 for a phone, another one takes money from unfriendly countries, one of them controls Internet search and one dominates e-commerce.","Amazon is the largest online retailer. Facebook is the largest social media platform. Google is the largest search engine with the greatest online ad revenue. Apple owns the US smartphone market (though Samsung has gained ground). The anti-trust playing field is calling: Amazon owns AWS (Amazon Web Services), Whole Foods, Alexa, CreateSpace, Kindle, Audible, Audible.com, DPReview, Box Office Mojo, Goodreads, Twitch.tv and AbeBooks, among lots of other companies and technologies. Facebook owns Instagram, Facebook Payments, Atlas, Instagram, Onavo, Moves, Oculus, WhatsApp, Masquerade and CrowdTangle, among other companies and technologies. Alphabet (Google) owns YouTube, Google Search/AdWords, Google Maps, AdSense, DoubleClick, Google Commerce/Wallet, Google Drive, Android, Google Chrome, Google Play, Nest Labs, Google Deep Mind, Calico, CapitalG, Google Fiber and Jigsaw, among many other companies and technologies. Apple owns Shazam, Emagic, Siri, Beats Electronics, NeXT, Novauris and PrimeSense, among many other companies and technologies. FAGA are also acquiring more companies every year. Does it end somewhere predictable? Since definitions of anti-trust change with each political administration in Washington, it’s hard to predict how anti-trust issues will evolve. While definitions of anti-trust should not swing so wildly, we live in turbulent political times. With pressures from consumers, the US Congress and the Executive Branch, there’s a good chance that anti-trust legislation will appear in 2018 or shortly after – especially as consolidation increases. If the Democratic party wins the House of Representatives back in 2018, anti-trust discussions will begin – despite all the donations tech companies give to Democrats. These are strange times, and the technology industry is not immune from political volatility.","Privacy Pushback","Information powers most of the web’s business models. Customization and personalization require information, data and knowledge about consumers and customers – which we gladly provide in exchange for “deals” of one kind or another. But how much personal information should we provide? How much do we want our vendors to know about where we are and what we do? There’s not much privacy in the digital age, at least not the way we define either today. How long will it take consumers to score the relative value of personalized transactions versus privacy? What will they decide? It’s unlikely that consumers will continue to share increasing amounts of personal data with Internet service providers, online retailers or their social media platforms if the price is total transparency for a free drink. Will 2018 be the start of major privacy pushback? Yes.","More Breaches At Greater Cost","If you haven’t been hacked, you’re lucky. Is it only a matter of time? Yes. The chances are excellent that your data is already somewhere beyond your control: think Equifax, eBay, Target, Yahoo, Home Depot, JP Morgan Chase, TJX, Heartland Payment Systems, Anthem, Verisign, Adobe, RSA Security, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Sony PlayStation, among many others. If you’ve had nothing to do with any of these hacked vendors, you may be OK. But it’s a long – and growing – list.","2018 will be the year of mega-breaches: bigger breaches with much bigger impact. When more individuals and corporations feel the effect of massive data breaches, they will blame their vendors, no matter who’s at fault. The question – “why can’t my vendor protect my data?” – will be asked too often in 2018. The financial services industry is obviously the most at risk since it’s the hub of personal and corporate financial data. But other hubs, like FAGA, also possess extraordinary amounts of personal and corporate data. What happens when everything we do – and all the websites we visit – are published? As more and more of our personal and professional lives move to the web, we can expect more breaches, more damage and more anger.","Small Currents Or Sea Changes?","Will positive sentiment toward technology companies continue to fall in 2018? Yes. The open question is how far it falls and whether the fall can be reversed. Prediction? This is the beginning of a new identity for FAGA and many other technology companies who were loved so dearly (and blindly) for years, but will now face a reckoning about their relationship with their customers, their government and their competitors. The party’s over. Too bad for them and especially for us. It felt good to love FAGA. I doubt we’ll ever feel that way again.","I am the Thomas G.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration","Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before.","He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company’s business for now, with advertisers unlikely to “suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform”.","“This episode appears likely to create another and potentially more serious public relations ‘black eye’ for the company and could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny,” said Peter Stabler, analyst at Wells Fargo.","The losses would be Facebook’s biggest daily fall since a broader market pullback in February. In January, when Facebook announced changes to its newsfeed which it said would hit user engagement in the near term, shares fell 4.5 percent in one day.","“It’s clear with more ‘heat in the kitchen from the Beltway’ that further modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” said Daniel Ives, research analyst at GBH Insights.","He also argued that the issue was “background noise” on which Facebook could calm any regulatory nerves through further investments in security, ad content AI, improved content algorithms and screening mechanisms.","No analysts had so far changed their price targets or recommendations on Facebook in response to the reports.

Who are the main players in today’s digital tracking? What can they infer from our purchases, phone calls, web searches, and Facebook likes? How do online platforms, tech companies, and data brokers collect, trade, and make use of personal data?","In recent years, a wide range of companies has started to monitor, track and follow people in virtually every aspect of their lives. The behaviors, movements, social relationships, interests, weaknesses and most private moments of billions are now constantly recorded, evaluated and analyzed in real-time. The exploitation of personal information has become a multi-billion industry. Yet only the tip of the iceberg of today’s pervasive digital tracking is visible; much of it occurs in the background and remains opaque to most of us.","This report by Cracked Labs examines the actual practices and inner workings of this personal data industry. Based on years of research and a previous 2016 report, the investigation shines light on the hidden data flows between companies. It maps the structure and scope of today’s digital tracking and profiling ecosystems and explores relevant technologies, platforms and devices, as well as key recent developments.","While the full report is available as PDF download, this web publication presents a ten part overview.","Download Full Report","Corporate Surveillance in Everyday Life. How Companies Collect, Combine, Analyze, Trade, and Use Personal Data on Billions. A Report by Cracked Labs, Vienna, June 2017. Author: Wolfie Christl.\n» Full Report as PDF","Cracked Labs\nis an independent research institute and creative laboratory based in Vienna, Austria. Previous projects include Data Dealer, an award-winning online game on privacy.","In 2007, Apple introduced the smartphone, Facebook reached 30 million users, and companies in online advertising started targeting ads to Internet users based on data about their individual preferences and interests. Ten years later, a vast landscape of data companies has emerged that consists not only of large players such as Facebook and Google but also of thousands of other businesses from various industries that continuously share and trade digital profiles with each other. Companies have begun combining and linking data from the web and smartphones with the customer data and offline information that they have been amassing for decades.","The pervasive real-time surveillance machine that has been developed for online advertising is rapidly expanding into other fields, from pricing to political communication to credit scoring to risk management. Large online platforms, digital advertising companies, data brokers, and businesses in many sectors can now identify, sort, categorize, assess, rate, and rank consumers across platforms and devices. Every click on a website and every swipe on a smartphone may trigger a wide variety of hidden data sharing mechanisms distributed across several companies and, as a result, directly affect a person’s available choices. Digital tracking and profiling, in combination with personalization, are not only used to monitor, but also to influence peoples’ behavior.","Omer Tene and Jules Polonetsky","...compare the relationship between data companies and individuals to a “game of poker where one of the players has his hand open and the other keeps his cards close”. When a rapidly growing number of daily interactions and behaviors undergo unrestricted digital monitoring and assessment, companies can systematically abuse their unprecedented data wealth for their economic advantage. This web publication and the associated report attempt to help alleviate this asymmetry.","I. Analyzing people","Scientific studies show that many aspects\nof someone’s personality can be inferred from data on web searches, browsing\nhistories, video viewing behaviors, social media activities, or purchases. For example, sensitive personal attributes such\nas ethnicity, religious and political views, relationship status, sexual\norientation, and alcohol, cigarette, and drug use can be quite accurately inferred from someone's Facebook likes. Analysis of social network profiles can\nalso predict personality traits such as emotional stability, life satisfaction,\nimpulsivity, depression and sensationalist\ninterest.","Analyzing Facebook likes, phone data, and typing patterns","Similarly, personality traits can be\ninferred from information about the websites\nsomeone has visited, as well as from phone\ncall records and data about mobile app usage. Browsing history can reveal information about\nsomeone’s occupation and educational level. Canadian researchers have even\nsuccessfully calculated emotional states\nsuch as confidence, nervousness, sadness, and tiredness by analyzing typing\npatterns on a computer keyboard.","II. Analyzing people in finance, insurance and healthcare","The results of today’s methods of data mining and analytics rely\non statistical correlations with certain probability levels. Although they may predict\nattributes and personality traits significantly above chance, they are naturally\nnot accurate in every case. Nevertheless, such methods are already used to sort,\ncategorize, label, assess, rate, and rank people not only for marketing\npurposes, but also for making decisions in highly consequential areas such as finance,\ninsurance, and healthcare, among others.","Credit assessment based on digital behavioral data","Startups such as Lenddo, Kreditech,\nCignifi and ZestFinance already utilize data from\nsocial media, web searches, or mobile phones to calculate someone’s creditworthiness\nwithout actually using data related to financial transactions. Some also draw\non information on how someone fills out an online form or navigates\non a website, the grammar\nand punctuation of one’s text messages, and the battery\nstatus on said individual’s phone. Some companies even include data about\nsomeone’s friends\non a social network in calculating credit scores.","Cignifi, which calculates credit scores\nfrom the timing and frequency of phone calls, sees itself as the “ultimate data monetization platform for mobile\nnetwork operators\". Large companies, including MasterCard, the mobile\nnetwork provider Telefonica, the credit\nreporting agencies Experian\nand Equifax, as well as the Chinese search giant\nBaidu,\nhave started to partner with such startups. The larger-scale application of\nsuch services is particularly on the rise in the countries of the global south,\nas well as for vulnerable population groups in other regions.","Conversely, credit data also flows into online\nmarketing. On Twitter, for example, marketers can target ads by the\npredicted creditworthiness of Twitter users based on data from the consumer data broker Oracle. Going a step\nfurther, Facebook has registered a patent\nfor credit assessment based on the credit ratings of someone’s friends on a\nsocial network. Nobody knows whether it plans to turn this total integration of\nsocial networking, marketing, and risk assessment into reality.","„We feel like all data is credit data, we just don’t know how to use it yet“","Douglas Merrill, founder of ZestFinance and former chief information officer at Google,\n2012","Predicting health based on consumer data","Data companies and insurers are working on\nprograms that use information on consumers’ everyday lives to predict their\nhealth risks. For example, the large insurer Aviva, in cooperation with\nthe consulting firm Deloitte, has predictedindividual\nhealth risks, such as for diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure and\ndepression, for 60,000 insurance applicants based on consumer\ndata traditionally used for marketing that it had purchased from a data\nbroker.","The consulting firm McKinsey has helped\npredict the hospital costs of patients based on consumer data for a “large\nUS payor” in healthcare. Using information about demographics, family\nstructure, purchases, car ownership, and other data, McKinsey stated that such “insights\ncan help identify key patient subgroups before high-cost episodes occur”.","The health analytics company GNS Healthcare\nalso calculates individual\nhealth risks for patients from a wide range of data such as genomics,\nmedical records, lab data, mobile health devices, and consumer\nbehavior. The company partners with insurers such as Aetna,\nprovides a score that identifies\n“people\nlikely to participate in interventions”, and offers to predict the\nprogression of illnesses and intervention outcomes. According to an industry\nreport, the company\n“ranks patients\nby how much return on investment” the insurer can expect if it targets them\nwith particular interventions.","LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a large data\nbroker and risk analytics company, provides a health\nscoring product that calculates health risks, as well as expected\nhealthcare costs for individuals, based on vast\namounts of consumer data, including purchase activities.","III. Large-scale collection and use of consumer data","Today’s\ndominant online platforms – above all Google\nand Facebook – have extensive information on the everyday lives of billions\nof people around the globe. They are the most visible, the most pervasive, and,\naside from intelligence contractors, online advertisers, and digital fraud\ndetection services, perhaps the most advanced players in the personal data and analytics industry.\nMany others operate behind the scenes and beyond public attention.","At its\ncore, online advertising consists of\nan ecosystem of thousands of companies focused on constantly tracking and\nprofiling billions of people. Every time an ad is displayed on a website or in\na mobile app, a user’s digital profile has just been sold to the highest bidder\nin the milliseconds before. In contrast to these new practices, credit reporting agencies and consumer data brokers have already\nspent decades in the business of personal data. In recent years, they started\ncombining the extensive information they have about people’s offline lives\nwith the user and customer databases operated\nby large platforms, online advertising companies, and myriads of\nother businesses across many industries.","Facebook uses at least 52,000\npersonal attributes to sort and categorize its 1.9 billion users by, for\nexample, their political views, ethnicity, and income. In order to do so, the\nplatform analyzes their posts, likes, shares, friends, photos, movements, and\nmany other kinds of behaviors.","In addition, Facebook acquires data on its users\nfrom other companies. In 2013,\nthe platform began its partnership with the four data brokers Acxiom, Epsilon, Datalogix\nand BlueKai, the latter two of which were\nsubsequently acquired by the IT giant Oracle. These companies help Facebook\ntrack and profile its users even better than it already does by providing it\nwith data collected from beyond its platform.","IV. Data brokers and the business of personal data","Consumer data brokers play a key role in today’s personal data industry. They\naggregate, combine, and trade massive\namounts of information collected from diverse online and offline sources on\nentire populations. Data brokers collect publicly available information and buy\nor license consumer data from other companies. Generally, their data stems from\nsources other than the individuals\nthemselves, and is collected largely\nwithout consumers’ knowledge. They analyze data, make inferences, sort\npeople into categories, and provide thousands of attributes on individuals to\ntheir clients.","The profiles that data brokers have on individuals include not\nonly information about education, occupation, children, religion, ethnicity,\npolitical views, activities, interests and media usage, but also about\nsomeone’s online behaviors such as web\nsearches. Additionally, they collect data about purchases, credit card\nusage, income and loans, banking and insurance policies, property and vehicle\nownership, and a variety of other data types. Data brokers also calculate scores\nthat predict an individual’s possible\nfuture behavior, with regard to, for example, someone’s economic stability\nor plans to have a baby or to change\njobs.","Some examples of data on consumers provided by Acxiom and Oracle","Examples of data on consumers provided by Acxiom and Oracle (as of April/May 2017). Sources see report","Acxiom, a large consumer data broker","Founded in\n1969, Acxiom runs one of the world’s largest commercial databases on consumers.\nThe company provides up to 3,000\ndata elements on 700\nmillion people from thousands\nof sources in many countries, including the US, the UK, and Germany. Initially\na direct marketing firm, Acxiom developed its centralized consumer database in\nthe late 1990s.","With its Abilitec Link system\nthe company runs a kind of private population register in which every person,\nhousehold, and building receives a unique\nID. The company constantly updates its database with information about births and deaths, marriages and divorces,\nname and address changes, and, of course all kinds of other profile data.\nWhen asked about a person, Acxiom provides,\nfor example, one of 13 religious\naffiliations including “Catholic”, “Jewish” and “Muslim”, and one of nearly\n200 ethnic\ncodes.","Acxiom and its data providers, partners and services","Acxiom and its data providers, partners, and clients (as of April/May 2017). Sources see report","Since the acquisition\nof the online data company LiveRamp in 2014, Acxiom has made major efforts to connect\nits decade-spanning data repository to the digital world. Acxiom was, for\nexample, among the first data brokers to provide additional information to Facebook, Google, and Twitter in order\nto help the platforms better track or categorize users based on purchases and\nother behaviors that the platforms were still not able to track.","Acxiom’s LiveRamp connects and combines digital profiles across hundreds of data and advertising companies.\nAt the core lies its IdentityLink system,\nwhich helps recognize individuals and link information about them across databases, platforms, and devices based on email addresses, phone numbers, smartphone IDs, and other identifiers. While the company promises\nthat linking and matching happens in ”anonymized”\nand “de-identified” ways, it also states that it is able to “connect\noffline data and online data back to a single identifier”.","Companies\nthat have recently been promoted as data\nproviders by LiveRamp include the credit\nreporting giants Equifax, Experian, and\nTransUnion. Furthermore, many digital\ntracking services that collect data from the web, mobile apps, and even sensors placed throughout the\nphysical world provide LiveRamp with data. Some\nof them use LiveRamp’s data store, which allows\ncompanies to “buy\nand sell valuable customer data“. Others provide data to let Acxiom and LiveRamp recognize individuals and link the recorded\ninformation with digital profiles from other sources. Perhaps most concerning\nis Acxiom’s partnership\nwith Crossix, a company with extensive health data on 250 million US consumers. It is listed as one of LiveRamp’s\ndata providers.","„anyone who captures data on consumers has the potential to be a data provider“","Oracle, an IT giant enters the consumer data business","By\nacquiring several data companies such as Datalogix, BlueKai, AddThis, and CrossWise,\nOracle, one of the world’s largest business\nsoftware and databases vendors, has recently become one of the largest consumer data brokers as well. In its data\ncloud Oracle aggregates 3\nbillion user profiles from 15\nmillion different websites, data from 1\nbillion mobile users, billions of purchases from grocery chains and 1,500\nlarge retailers, as well as 700\nmillion messages from\nsocial media networks, blogs, and consumer review sites per day.","Oracle aggregates data on billions of consumers","Oracle and its data providers, partners and services (as of April/May 2017). Sources see report","Oracle\nlists nearly 100 data providers in its data\ndirectory, including Acxiom and\ncredit reporting agencies such as Experian\nand TransUnion, as well as companies that track website visits, mobile app\nusage, and movements, or that collect data from online quizzes. Visa and MasterCard are listed as data\nproviders, too. Together with its partners, Oracle provides over 30,000\ndifferent data categories that may be assigned to consumers. Conversely, the\ncompany shares data with Facebook\nand helps Twitter calculate the\ncreditworthiness of its users.","Oracle’s ID Graph identifies and combines user profiles across\ncompanies. It\n“unites all interactions” across databases, services and devices to\n“create one addressable consumer profile” and\n“identify customers and prospects everywhere”. Other companies can send match\nkeys based on email addresses, phone\nnumbers, postal addresses, and other identifiers to Oracle, which will then\nsynchronize them to its\n“network of user and statistical IDs that are linked together in the Oracle ID Graph”.\nAlthough the company promises to only use anonymous\nuser IDs and anonymous\nuser profiles, these still refer to certain individuals and can be used to recognize\nthem and to single them out in many life contexts.","Generally,\nclients can upload their own data about\ncustomers, website visitors, or app users to Oracle’s data cloud, combine it with data\nfrom many other companies and then transfer and utilize it on hundreds of other\nmarketing and advertising technology platforms in real-time. They can use it\nto, for example, find and target\npeople across devices and platforms, personalize\ninteractions, and eventually, to measure\nhow consumers respond after having been addressed and affected on an\nindividual level.","V. Real-time monitoring of behaviors across everyday life","Online\nplatforms, advertising technology providers, data brokers, and businesses in\nall industries can now monitor, recognize, and analyze individuals in many\nsituations. They are able to learn what people are interested in, what they did\ntoday, what they are likely to do tomorrow, and how much they might be worth as\na customer.","Data about people’s online and offline lives","A wide\nrange of companies has been collecting information on people for decades.\nBefore the Internet, both credit bureaus and direct marketing agencies were major points of integration between data flowing from different sources. A\nfirst big step into systematic consumer surveillance occurred in the 1990s\nthrough database marketing, loyalty programs, and advanced consumer credit\nreporting. Following the ascent of the Internet and online advertising in the early\n2000s and the rise of social networks, smartphones, and online advertising in\nthe late 2000s, we now see the traditional consumer data industry\nintegrating with the new digital tracking and profiling ecosystem in the 2010s.","Mapping data collection on consumers","Different levels, realms and sources of corporate consumer data collection.","Consumer data brokers and other firms have long been acquiring\ninformation on newspaper and magazine subscribers, book and movie club members,\ncatalog and mail order buyers, travel agency bookers, seminar and conference\nparticipants, and consumers filling out warranty card product registrations.\nThe collection of purchase data from loyalty\nprograms has also long been an established practice in this regard.","In addition\nto data directly gathered from individuals they have been using, for example,\ninformation about the types of neighborhoods and buildings people are\nliving in to characterize, label, sort, and categorize people. Similarly,\ncompanies now profile consumers based on metadata about the types of\nwebsites they surf, the videos they watch, the apps they use, and the\ngeographic locations they visit. In recent years, the scale and depth of\nbehavioral data streams generated by all sorts of everyday activities, such\nas web, social media, and device usage, have risen rapidly.","Ubiquitous digital tracking and profiling","One major\nreason that corporate tracking and profiling has become so pervasive lies in\nthe fact that nearly all websites, mobile app providers, and many device vendors\nactively share behavioral data with other companies.","A few years\nago most websites began embedding\ntracking services that transmit user data to third parties into their\nwebsites. Some of these services provide visible functionality to users. When a\nwebsite shows, for example, a Facebook like button or an embedded YouTube\nvideo, user data is transmitted to Facebook or Google. Many other services\nrelated to online advertising remain hidden, though, and largely serve only one\npurpose, namely to collect user data. It is widely unknown exactly which kinds\nof user data digital publishers share and how third parties use this data.\nAt least\npart of these tracking activities can be examined by everybody; by installing\nthe browser extension Lightbeam,\nfor example, one can visualize the hidden network third-party trackers.","A\nrecent study examined one million\ndifferent websites and found more than 80,000\nthird-party services that receive data about the visitors of these\nwebsites. Around 120 of these tracking services were found on more than 10,000 websites, and six companies monitor users on more than 100,000 websites,\nincluding Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Oracle’s BlueKai. A study on 200,000\nusers from Germany visiting 21 million web pages showed that third-party\ntrackers were present on 95% of the\npages visited. Similarly,\nmost mobile apps share information on their users with other companies. A 2015 study\nof popular apps in Australia, Brazil, Germany, and the US found that between\n85% and 95% of free apps and\neven 60% of paid apps connect to third parties that collect personal\ndata.","An interactive map of hidden\nthird-party tracking services on Android apps created by researchers from\nEurope and the US can be explored at: haystack.mobi/panopticon.","In terms of\ndevices, smartphones are perhaps the\nbiggest contributors to today’s ubiquitous data collection. The information\nrecorded by mobile phones provides detailed insights into a user’s personality\nand everyday life. Since consumers generally need to have a Google, Apple, or Microsoft account to\nuse them, much of the information is already linked to a major platform’s\nidentifier.","Selling user data is not restricted to website and mobile app\npublishers. The marketing intelligence company SimilarWeb, for example,\nreceives data not only from hundreds\nof thousands of direct measurement sources from websites and apps, but also\nfrom desktop\nsoftware and browser extensions. In recent years, many other kinds of\ndevices with sensors and networkconnections have entered everyday life,\nfrom e-readers and wearables to smart\nTVs, meters, thermostats, smoke alarms, printers, fridges, toothbrushes, toys,\nand cars. Like smartphones, these devices give companies unprecedented\naccess to consumer behavior across many life contexts.","Programmatic advertising and marketing technology","The online advertising industry has become a pioneering\nforce in developing sophisticated technologies that monitor and track\npeople, as well as ones to combine and link profiles across the digital world.","Most of\ntoday’s digital advertising takes place in the form of highly automated\nreal-time auctions between publishers and advertisers; this is often referred\nto as programmatic advertising. When a person visits a website, it sends\nuser data to a variety of third-party services, which then try to recognize the\nperson and retrieve available profile information. Advertisers interested in\ndelivering an ad to this particular person due to certain attributes and\nbehaviors make a bid. Within milliseconds, the highest-bidding\nadvertiser wins and places the ad. Advertisers can similarly bid on user profiles and ad placements\nwithin mobile apps.","For the\nmost part, however, this process does not take place directly between publishers and advertisers. The\necosystem consists of a plethora of different kinds of data\nand technology providers interacting with each other, including ad\nnetworks, ad exchanges, sell-side platforms, and demand-side platforms. Some of\nthese specialize in tracking and advertising alongside search results,\ngeneral ads on\nthe web, mobile\nads, video\nads, social\nnetwork ads, or ads within games.\nOthers focus on providing data, analytics, or personalization services.","To profile\nweb or mobile app users, all parties involved have developed sophisticated\nmethods to accumulate, compile, and link information from different companies\nin order to follow individuals across\ntheir lives. Many of them collect or utilize digital profiles on hundreds\nof millions of consumers, their web browsers, and devices.","Many industries are joining the tracking economy","In recent\nyears, businesses in many industries have started to share and utilize data on\ntheir users and customers at a massive scale.","Most retailers\nsell more or less aggregated forms of purchase\ndata to market research companies and consumer data brokers. The data\ncompany IRI, for example, accesses data from more than 85,000\ngrocery, mass merchandise, drug, club, dollar, convenience, liquor, and pet\nstores. Nielsen states that it collects sales information from worldwide 900,000\nstores in more than 100 countries.\nThe large\nBritish retailer Tesco has\noutsourced its loyalty and data activities to a subsidiary company, Dunnhumby,\nwhose slogan is “transforming\ncustomer data into customer delight”. When Dunnhumby acquired the German ad\ntechnology company Sociomantic, they announced\nthat Dunnhumby will “combine its extensive insights on the shopping preferences\nof 400 million consumers” with Sociomantic’s “real-time data from more than 700\nmillion online consumers” to personalize and evaluate advertising.","Mapping the commercial digital tracking and profiling landscape","In addition to the large online platforms and the consumer data and analytics industry, businesses in many industries have joined today’s pervasive digital tracking and profiling ecosystems","Like\nairlines, hotels, retailers and companies in many other industries, the financial\nservices sector started to aggregate and utilize additional customer\ndata with loyalty programs in the 1980s and 1990s. Companies with related,\ncomplementary target groups have long been sharing certain customer data with\neach other, a process often managed by intermediaries. Today, one of these\nintermediaries is Cardlytics, a firm that runs reward programs with 1,500 financial\ninstitutions such as the Bank of America\nand MasterCard. Cardlytics promises\nfinancial institutions that it will “generate new revenue streams using the\npower of [their] purchase data”. The company also partners with LiveRamp, the\nAcxiom subsidiary that combines\nonline and offline consumer data.","„It’s your data. You have the right to control it, share it and use it how you see fit.“","How the online data broker Lotame addresses its corporate clients on its website,\n2016","VI. Linking, matching and combining digital profiles","Until\nrecently, advertisers who used Facebook, Google or other online ad networks\ncould target individuals based only on their online behavior. However, a few years\nago data companies began providing ways to combine and link digital profiles\nacross platforms, customer databases, and the world of online advertising.","Connecting online and offline identities","In 2012, Facebook started allowing companies to upload\ntheir own lists of email addresses and phone numbers to the platform. Although\nthese addresses and numbers are converted into pseudonymous\ncodes, Facebook can directly link this customer data from other companies\nwith Facebook user accounts. In this way, companies can, for example, find and target exactly those persons\non Facebook that they have email addresses or phone numbers on. They could also\nselectively exclude them from targeting or let the platform find people with\nsimilar attributes, interests, and behaviors.","This is a powerful feature, perhaps more powerful\nthan it seems at first glance. It allows companies to systematically connect\ntheir own customer data with Facebook’s data. Moreover, it also allows other\nadvertising and data vendors to synchronize with the platform’s databases and\ntap into its capacities, essentially providing a kind of real-time remote control for Facebook’s data universe. Companies\ncan now capture highly specific behavioral data, such as a click on a website,\na swipe in a mobile app or a purchase in a store, in real-time, and tell\nFacebook to immediately find and target the persons who performed these\nactivities. Google\nand Twitter\nlaunched similar features in 2015.","Data management platforms","Today, most\nadvertising technology companies continuously pass various forms of\ncodes referring to individualsonto each other. Data management platforms allow\nbusinesses in all industries to combine\nand link their own data on consumers, including real-time information about\npurchases, website visits, app usage, and email responses, with digital profiles provided by myriads third-party data\nproviders. The combined data can then be analyzed, sorted and categorized, and\nused to address certain people with certain messages on certain channels or\ndevices. A company could, for example, target a group of existing customers\nthat visited a certain page on its website, and are predicted to become valuable customers, with personalized content\nor a discount – either on Facebook, in a mobile app, or on the company’s own\nwebsite.","The\nemergence of data management platforms marks a key moment inthe development of pervasive commercial behavioral tracking. With\ntheir help, businesses in all industries across the globe are able to\nseamlessly combine and link the data they have collected about their customers\nand prospects for years with billions of profiles collected within the world of\ndigital tracking. Companies running such platforms include\nOracle, Adobe, Salesforce (Krux), Wunderman (KBM Group/Zipline), Neustar,\nLotame, and Cxense.","„We will serve ads to you based on your identity, but that doesn't mean you're identifiable“","Identifying people and linking digital profiles","To monitor\nand follow people in many situations of their lives, combine profiles on them,\nand always recognize them as the same individuals again, companies collect a wide\nrange of data attributes that identify them in some way.","Because of\nits ambiguity a person's legal name has always been a bad identifier for data collection.\nThe postal address, in contrast, has\nlong been, and still is, a key attribute that allows combining and linking data\nabout consumers and their families from different sources. In the digital\nworld, the most relevant identifiers used to link profiles and behavioral data\nacross different databases, platforms, and devices are email addresses, phone numbers, and unique codes that refer to\nsmartphones or other devices.","User account IDs of the large platforms such as Google,\nFacebook, Apple, and Microsoft also play an important role in following people\nacross the Internet. Google, Apple, Microsoft,\nand Roku\nassign “advertising IDs” to\nindividuals, which are now widely used to match and link data from devices\nsuch as smartphones with other information from all over the digital world. Verizon\nuses its own identifier to track users across websites and devices. Some large\ndata companies such as Acxiom, Experian,\nand Oracle have introduced globally\nunique IDs for people, which they use to link their decades-old consumer\ndatabases and other profile information from different sources with the digital\nworld. These corporate IDs mostly\nconsist of two or\nmore identifiers that are attached to different aspects of the online and\noffline life of someone and can be linked to each other in certain ways.","Identifiers used to track people across websites, devices and areas of life","How companies identify consumers and link profile information about them. Sources see report",".","Tracking\ncompanies also use more-or-less temporary identifiers, such as cookie IDs\nthat are attached to users surfing the web. Since users may disallow or delete\ncookies in their web browser, they have developed sophisticated methods to\ncalculate unique digital fingerprints\nbased on various attributes of someone’s web browser and computer. Similarly,\ncompanies compile fingerprints for devices such as smartphones. Cookie\nIDs and digital fingerprints are constantly\nsynchronized between different tracking services, and then linked with\nother, more permanent identifiers.","Other\ncompanies provide cross-device tracking services that are based on using\nmachine learning to analyze large amounts of data. For example, Tapad, which has been acquired by the\nNorwegian telecom giant Telenor, analyzes data on 2\nbillion devices around the globe and uses behavioral and relationship-based\npatterns to find the statistical chance that certain computers, tablets,\nphones and other devices belong to the same person.","“Anonymous” profiling?","Data\ncompanies often remove names from their extensive profiles and use hashing\nto convert email addresses and phone numbers into alphanumeric codes such as “e907c95ef289”. This allows them to\nclaim on their websites and in their privacy policies that they only collect,\nshare, and use “anonymized” or “de-identified” consumer data.","However,\nbecause most companies use the same deterministic processes to calculate these\nunique codes, they should be understood as pseudonyms that are,\nin fact, much more suitable for identifying consumers across the digital world\nthan real names. Even if the profiles companies share with one another only contain “hashed” or\n“encrypted” email addresses and phone numbers with each other, a person can still be recognized again\nas soon as he or she uses another service linked with the same email address or\nphone number. In this way, even though each of the tracking services involved\nmight only know a part of someone’s profile information, companies can follow and interact with people at an\nindividual level across services, platforms, and devices.","„If a company can follow and interact with you in the digital environment – and that potentially includes the mobile phone and your television set – its claim that you are anonymous is meaningless, particularly when firms intermittently add offline information to the online data and then simply strip the name and address to make it ‘anonymous’.“","Joseph Turow, marketing and privacy scholar in his book “The Daily You”, 2011","VII. Managing consumers and behaviors, personalization and testing","Based on\nthe sophisticated methods of linking and combining data across different\nservices, businesses in all industries can utilize today’s ubiquitous\nbehavioral data streams to monitor and analyze a wide range of consumer\nactivities and behaviors that might be relevant to their business interests.","With the\nhelp of data vendors, companies try to capture as many touchpoints\nacross the whole customer\njourney as possible, from digital ones to in-store purchases, direct mail,\nTV ads, and call center calls. They try to record\nand measure every interaction with a consumer, including on websites,\nplatforms, and devices they do not control themselves. They can seamlessly\ncollect rich data about their customers and others in real-time, enhance\nthem with information from third parties, and utilize the enriched\nprofiles withinthe\nmarketing and ad technology ecosystem. Today’s consumer data management platforms allow\nfor the definition of complex sets of\nrules that dictate how to automatically react to specific criteria such as\ncertain activities, people, or some combination thereof.","Consequently,\nindividuals never know whether their\nbehavior triggered a reaction from any of these continuously updated,\ninterconnected, opaque networks of tracking and profiling, and, if so, how this\naffects the options they get across communication channels and life situations.","Tracking, profiling and affecting people in real-time","Every interaction triggers a wide range of data flows between multiple companies.","Mass personalization","The data\nstreams that are shared between online advertisers, data brokers, and other\ncompanies are not only used to display precisely targeted ads on websites or\nwithin mobile apps to users. They are increasingly used to dynamically personalize the contents, options, and\nchoices offered to consumers on, for example, a company’s website. The data\ntechnology firm Optimizely, for instance, can help personalize a website for first time\nvisitors, based on digital profiles on those visitors provided by Oracle.","Online\nstores might, for example, personalize how someone is addressed, which products are displayed\nprominently, which discounts are\noffered, and even the prices of products or services can differ based on who is\nvisiting a website. Online fraud detection services assess users in real-time\nand decide which payment and shipping\nmethods someone sees.","Companies have developed technologies to constantly calculate and rate\nsomeone’s potential long-term\nvalue based on information about a said person’s\nbrowsing, search, and location history, as well as app usage, product purchases, or friends on a social network.\nEvery\nclick, swipe, like, share, or purchase might automatically influence how someone is treated as a customer,\nhow long someone has to wait when calling a phone hotline, or whether someone\nis excluded from marketing efforts or services at all.","Three types of technology platforms play an important role for this\nkind of instant personalization. First, companies use advanced Customer\nRelationship Managementsystems to manage their data on\ncustomers and prospects. Second, they use Data\nManagement Platformsto connect their own data to the digital\nadvertising ecosystem, and gain additional profile information about their\ncustomers. Third, they can use Predictive Marketing Platforms, which\nhelp them compile the right\nmessage to the right person at the right time by calculating how to persuade\nsomeone by exploiting personal biases and weaknesses.","The data\ncompany RocketFuel, for example, promises its clients to “bring\ntogether trillions of digital and real-world signals to create individual\nprofiles and deliver personalized, always-on, always-relevant experiences to\nthe consumer”, based on 2.7 billion unique\nprofiles in its data store. RocketFuel says that it “scores\nevery impression for its propensity to influence the consumer”.","The\npredictive marketing platform TellApart,\nwhich belongs to Twitter, creates a customer value score\nfor each shopper and product combination, a “compilation of likelihood to\npurchase, predicted order size, and lifetime value”, based on “100s of online\nand in-store signals about a particular anonymous customer”. Subsequently,\nTellApart helps automatically assemble content such as “product imagery, logos,\noffers and any metadata” for personalized ads, emails, websites, and offers.","Personalized pricing and election campaigns","Similar\nmethods can be used to personalize prices in online shops by, for example,\npredicting how valuable someone might be as customer in the long term or\nhow much someone is probably willing to pay in a moment. Strong evidence suggests\nthat online shops already show differently\npriced products to different consumers, or even different prices for the\nsame products, based on their individual characteristics and behaviors.\nA similar field is the use of personalization during election campaigns. Targeting voters with personalized\nmessagesthat are\nadapted to their personality and to their political views on certain issues has\nalready raised massive\ndebates about the potential for political\nmanipulation.","Utilizing data, analytics, and personalization to manage consumers","Businesses in all industries can utilize today’s networks of digital tracking and profiling to find, assess, address, sort and manage customers.","Testing and experimenting on people","Personalization\nbased on rich profile information and pervasive real-time monitoring has become\na powerful tool set to influence\nconsumer behavior such as visiting a website, clicking on an ad,\nregistering for a service, subscribing to a newsletter, downloading an app, or\npurchasing a product.","To further\nimprove this, companies have started continuously experimenting on people. They\nconduct tests with different variations of functionalities, website designs,\nuser interface elements, headlines, button texts, images, or even different\ndiscounts and prices, and then carefully monitor and measure how different\ngroups of users interact with these variations. In this way, companies systematically optimize their ability to\nnudge people into acting how they want them to act.","News\norganizations, including large outlets such as the Washington\nPost, use different versions of\narticle headlines to test which variant performs better. Optimizely, one of\nthe major technology providers for such tests, offers its clients the ability to\n“experiment broadly across the entire customer experience, on any channel, any\ndevice, and any application”. Experimenting on unaware users has become the new normal.","Facebookstated\nin 2014 that it runs “over a thousand experiments each day” in order to\n“optimize specific outcomes” or “inform long-term design decisions”. In 2010 and 2012,\nthe platform conducted experiments on millions of users andshowed that manipulating\nFacebook’s user interface, functionalities, and displayed content can significantly increase voter turnout\nfor groups of people. The platform’s notorious mood experiment on\nnearly 700,000 users involved secretly manipulating the amount of emotionally\npositive and negative posts in users’ news feeds, which ended up influencing how many emotionally positive\nand negative messages the users then posted themselves.","After\nmassive public criticism of Facebook’s experiments, the online dating platform OkCupid released a provocative blog\npost defending such practices, stating that “we experiment on human beings”\nand “so does everybody else”. OkCupid reported on an experiment wherein they\nhad manipulated the “match” percentage shown to pairs of users. When they\nshowed a 90% match to actually bad-matching pairs, these users exchanged\nsignificantly more messages with each other. OkCupid claimed that when they\n“tell people” they are a “good match”, they “act as if they are”.","All these\nethically highly questionable experiments clearly demonstrate the power of data-driven personalization to influence behavior.","VIII. Dragnet – everyday life, marketing data and risk analytics","Data about\npeople’s behaviors, social relationships, and most private moments is\nincreasingly applied in contexts or for purposes completely different from\nthose for which it was recorded. In particular, it is increasingly used to make\nautomated decisions about individuals\nin crucial areas of life such as finance, insurance, and healthcare.","Risk data for marketing and customer management","Credit\nreporting agencies and other key\nplayers in risk assessment in fields such as identity verification, fraud\nprevention, healthcare and insurance analytics mostly also provide marketing\nsolutions. Furthermore, most consumer data brokers trade many kinds of\nsensitive information – e.g. about an individual’s financial situation – for\nmarketing purposes. The use of credit scores for marketing purposes to either\nfocus on or exclude vulnerable population groups has evolved into products that\nunify marketing and risk management.","The credit\nreporting agency TransUnion\nprovides, for example, a product for data-driven\ndecisions in retail and financial services that allows clients to\n“implement marketing and risk strategies tailored for customer, channel and\nbusiness goals”, including credit\ndata and promising “unique insights into consumer behavior, preferences and\nrisk”. Companies can let consumers “choose from a suite of offerings that are\ntailored to their needs, preferences and risk profile” and “evaluate a customer\nfor multiple products across channels, and then only present the offer(s) that\nare most relevant to them, and profitable” for the company. Similarly, Experian provides a product\nthat combines “consumer credit and marketing information that is compliantly\navailable from Experian”.","„Surveillance is not about knowing your secrets, but about managing populations, managing people“","Online identity verification and fraud detection","In addition\nto the real-time surveillance machine that has been developed within online\nadvertising, another forms of pervasive\ntracking and profiling has emerged in the fields of risk analytics, fraud detection and cyber security.","Today’s online\nfraud detection services use highly invasive technologies to evaluate billions of digital transactions\nand collect vast amounts of information about devices, individuals, and\nbehaviors. Traditional vendors in credit reporting, identity verification,\nand fraud prevention have started to monitor and evaluate how people surf the\nweb and use their mobile devices. Furthermore, they have started to link digital behavioral data with the vast\namounts of offline identity information that they have been collecting for\ndecades.","With the\nrise of technology-mediated services, verifying consumer identities and\npreventing fraud have both become increasingly important and challenging\nissues, especially in light of cybercrime and automated fraud. At the same\ntime, today’s risk analytics systems have aggregated giant databases with sensitive information on entire populations.\nMany of these systems cover a wide range of use cases, including proof of\nidentity for financial services, assessing insurance and benefits claims,\nanalyzing payment transactions, and evaluating billions of online transactions.","Such risk\nanalytics systems may decide whether an application or transaction is accepted or rejected or which payment\nand shipping options are available for someone during an online transaction.\nCommercial services for identity verification and fraud analytics are also used\nin areas such as law enforcement and\nnational security. The line between commercial applications of identity and\nfraud analytics and those used by government intelligence services is blurring more and more.","When people\nare singled out by such opaque systems, they might get flagged as suspicious and warranting special treatment or investigation\n– or they may be rejected without explanation. They might get an email, a phone\ncall, a notification, an error message, or the system may simply withhold an\noption without the user ever knowing of its existence for others. Inaccurate\nassessments may spread from one system to another. It is often difficult or impossible to object to\nsuch negative assessments that exclude or deny, especially because of how hard\nit is to object to mechanisms or decisions that someone does not know about at\nall.","Examples of online fraud detection and risk analytics services","The cyber\nsecurity firm ThreatMetrix processes data on 1.4\nbillion “unique user accounts” across “thousands of global websites”. Its Digital Identity\nNetwork captures “millions of daily consumer transactions including logins,\npayments and new account originations”, and maps the “ever-changing\nassociations between people and their devices, locations, account credentials,\nand behavior” for identity verification and fraud prevention purposes. The\ncompany partners with\nEquifax and TransUnion. Its clients include Netflix,\nVisa,\nand firms in fields such as gaming, government services, and healthcare.","Similarly,\nthe data company ID Analytics, which was recently acquired by Symantec,\nruns an ID\nNetwork with “100 million identity elements coming in each day from leading\ncross-industry organizations”. The company aggregates data on 300 million\nconsumers, including on\nsub-prime loans, online purchases and credit card and wireless phone\napplications. Its ID\nScore evaluates digital devices, as well as names, social security numbers,\nand postal and email addresses.","Trustev, an online fraud detection company\nbased in Ireland, which was acquired by the credit reporting agency TransUnion\nin 2015, evaluates\nonline transactions for clients in financial services, government, healthcare,\nand insurance, based on the analysis\nof digital behaviors, identities, and devices such as phones, tablets, laptops,\ngame consoles, TVs, and even refrigerators. The company offers corporate\nclients the ability to analyze how\nvisitors click and interact with websites and apps, and uses a wide range of data to assess\nusers, including phone numbers, email and postal addresses, browser and device\nfingerprints, credit checks, transaction histories across merchants, IP\naddresses, mobile carrier details and cell locations. To help “approve future\ntransactions” every device receives a unique\ndevice fingerprint. Trustev also offers a social\nfingerprinting technology that analyzes social media content, including “friend list analysis” and “pattern\nidentification”. TransUnion has integrated\nTrustev technology into its own identity and fraud solutions.","Trustev uses a wide range of data to assess people, according to its website:","Similarly,\nthe credit reporting agency Equifax states that it has data on nearly 1\nbillion devices and can validate “where a device really is and whether it\nis associated with other devices used in known fraud”. By combining\nthis data with “billions of identity and credit events to find suspicious\nactivity” across industries, and with information about employment and about relationships\nbetween households, families and associates, Equifax claims to be able to\n“identify devices as well as individuals”.","I am not a robot","Google’s reCaptcha product actually provides\nsimilar functionality, at least in parts. It is embedded into millions of\nwebsites and helps website providers decide whether a visitor is a legitimate\nhuman being or not. Until recently, users had to solve several kinds of quick\nchallenges such as deciphering letters on a picture, choosing objects in a grid\nof pictures, or simply clicking on an “I’m not a robot” checkbox. In 2017,\nGoogle introduced an invisible\nversion of reCaptcha, explaining\nthat from now on “human users will be let through” without any user interaction in contrast to “suspicious ones and\nbots”. The company doesn’t disclose which kinds of user data and behaviors it\nuses to identify\nhumans. Investigations suggest\nthat Google doesn’t only use IP addresses, browser fingerprints, the way user’s\ntype, move their mouse, or use their touchscreen \"before, during, and\nafter\" a reCaptcha interaction, but also several of Google’s cookies. It is not clear whether people without\nuser accounts face a disadvantage, whether Google is able to identify specific\nindividuals rather than only “humans”, or whether Google also uses the data\nrecorded within reCaptcha for purposes other than for bot detection.","Digital tracking for advertising and fraud detection?","The\nubiquitous streams of behavioral data recorded for online advertising\nincreasingly flow into fraud detection systems. The marketing data platformSegment,\nfor example, offers clients easy ways to send data about their customers,\nwebsite, and mobile app users to many different marketing technology services,\nbut also to fraud detection companies.\nOne of them is Castle,\nwhich uses “customer behavioral data to predict which users are likely a\nsecurity or fraud risk”. Another one, Smyte, helps “prevent scams,\nspam, harassment and credit card fraud”.","The large\ncredit reporting agency Experian\noffers a cross-device tracking service that provides universal\ndevice recognition across mobile, web, and apps for digital marketing. The company promises to reconcile\nand associate their client’s “existing digital identifiers”, including\n“cookies, device IDs, IP addresses and more”, providing\nmarketers with a “ubiquitous, consistent and persistent link across all\nchannels”.","Experian’s\ndevice identification technology comes from 41st parameter, an online fraud detection company that Experian acquired\nin 2013. Based on 41st parameter’s technology, Experian also offers a device\nintelligence solution for fraud\ndetection during online payments, which “establishes a reliable ID for the\ndevice and collects rich device data”, “identifies every device on every visit\nin milliseconds” and “gives unparalleled visibility into the person behind the\npayment”. It is not clear whether\nExperian uses the same data for its device identification services in fraud\ndetection and marketing.","IX. Mapping the commercial tracking and profiling landscape","In recent years, pre-existing practices of\ncommercial surveillance have rapidly evolved into a vast landscape of corporate\nplayers that constantly monitor entire populations. Some actors in today’s pervasive tracking\nand profiling ecosystem, such as the large platforms and other companies\nwith large numbers of customers, have a unique position in terms of the\nscale and depth of their consumer profiles. Nevertheless, the data used to make\ndecisions on people in many areas of life is mostly not held in one place, but rather\nassembled from several sources in real-time, as needed.","A wide range of data\nand analytics companies in marketing, customer management and risk analytics\nseamlessly gather, analyze, share, and trade consumer data as well as combine\nit with further information from thousands of other companies. While the data\nand analytics industry provides the means to deploy these powerful technologies,\nbusinesses in many industries equally contribute both to intensifying the\namount and detail of the collected data and the ability to utilize it.","Mapping the commercial digital tracking and profiling landscape","In addition to the large online platforms and the consumer data and analytics industry, businesses in many industries have joined today’s pervasive digital tracking and profiling ecosystems","Google and Facebook, followed by other large platforms such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon\nand Alibaba have unprecedented access to data about the lives of billions of\npeople. Although they have different business models and therefore play\ndifferent roles in the personal data industry, they have the power to widely dictate\nthe basic parameters of the overall digital markets. The large platforms mostly\nrestrict how other firms can directly obtain their data; in this way, they\nforce them to utilize the platform’s data on users within their own\necosystems and gather additional data from beyond the platforms’ reach.","Although the large multinationals in\ndifferent sectors that have frequent interactions with hundreds of millions of\nconsumers are in a somewhat similar position, they not only acquire consumer\ndata collected by others, but often also provide data. While parts of the\nfinancial services and telecoms sectors, as well as crucial societal areas\nsuch as healthcare, education, and employment, are subject to stronger privacy\nregulation in most jurisdictions, a wide range of companies has started to\nutilize or contribute data to today’s networks of commercial surveillance.","Retailers\nand other companies that sell products and services to consumers mostly also\nsell data about their customers’ purchases. Media conglomerates and digital publishers\nsell data about their audiences, which is then utilized by companies in most\nother sectors. Telecom and broadband providers have started following\ntheir customers through the web. Large companies in retail, media and telecom have\nacquired or are acquiring data, tracking, and advertising technology firms.\nWith Comcast acquiring NBC Universal, and AT&T most likely acquiring Time\nWarner, the large telecoms in the US are also becoming giant publishers,\ncreating powerful portfolios of content, data, and targeting capabilities. With\nits acquisition of AOL and Yahoo, Verizon also became a “platform”.","Financial institutions have long used data on consumers for risk management, such as\ncredit scoring and fraud detection, as well as for marketing, customer acquisition,\nand retention. They supplement their own data with external data from credit reporting\nagencies, data brokers and marketing data companies. PayPal, the biggest\nname in online payments, shares personal information with more than 600\nthird parties including other payment providers, credit reporting agencies,\nidentity verification and fraud detection companies, as well as with the most\nadvanced players within the digital tracking ecosystems. While credit card\nnetworks and banks have shared financial data on their customers with risk data\nproviders for decades, they have now started selling transactional data\nfor marketing purposes.","A myriad of smaller and larger firms\nproviding websites, apps, games, and other applications are closely\nconnected to the marketing data ecosystem. They use services that allow them to\neasily transmit data about their users to hundreds of third-party services.\nMany of them sell their users’ behavioral data streams as a core part of their\nbusiness model. Even more worryingly, companies that provide new kinds of\ndevices such as fitness trackers also seamlessly embed\nservices that transfer user data to third parties.","The pervasive real-time surveillance\nmachine that has been developed for online advertising is rapidly\nexpanding into other fields including politics, pricing, credit scoring, and\nrisk management. Insurers all over the world have started to offer their\ncustomers programs involving\nreal-time tracking of behaviors such as car driving, health activities, grocery\npurchases, or visits to the fitness studio. New players in insurance\nanalytics and financial technology predict individual health risks based on\nconsumer data, as well as the creditworthiness of individuals based on\nbehavioral data on phone calls or web searches.","Consumer data brokers, customer management companies, and advertising agencies such as\nAcxiom, Epsilon, Merkle or Wunderman/WPP play a major role in combining and\nconnecting data between platforms, multinationals, and the advertising\ntechnology world. Credit reporting agencies like Experian that provide\nmany services in very sensitive fields such as credit reporting, identity\nverification and fraud detection also play a major role in today’s pervasive\nmarketing data ecosystem.","Particular large companies that provide data,\nanalytics, and software services have been named as “platforms” as well. Oracle,\na large database and business software provider, has become a consumer data\nbroker in recent years. Salesforce, the market leader in customer\nrelationship management that is managing the customer databases of millions of\nclients, yet having many customers each, has acquired\nKrux, a major data company connecting and combining data all over the digital\nworld. The software company Adobe also plays an important role\nin profiling and advertising technology.","In addition, most major companies in business\nsoftware, analytics and consulting, such as IBM, Informatica, SAS, FICO,\nAccenture, Capgemini, Deloitte, and McKinsey, or even intelligence and\ndefense firms such as Palantir, also play a significant role in the\nmanagement and analysis of personal data, from customer relationship management\nto identity management to marketing to risk analytics for insurers, banks, and\ngovernments.","X. Towards a society of pervasive digital social control?","This report finds that the networks of\nonline platforms, advertising technology providers, data brokers, and other businesses\ncan now monitor, recognize, and analyze individuals in many life situations.\nInformation about individuals’ personal characteristics and behaviors is\nlinked, combined, and utilized across companies, databases, platforms, devices,\nand services in real-time. With the actors guided only by economic goals, a data\nenvironment has emerged in which individuals are constantly surveyed and\nevaluated, categorized and grouped, rated and ranked, numbered and quantified,\nincluded or excluded, and, as a result, treated differently.","Several key developments in recent\nyears have rapidly introduced unprecedented new qualities to ubiquitous\ncorporate surveillance. These include the rise of social media and networked\ndevices, the real-time tracking and linking of behavioral data streams, the\nmerging of online and offline data, and the consolidation of marketing and risk\nmanagement data. Pervasive digital tracking and profiling, in combination with\npersonalization and testing, are not only used to monitor, but also to\nsystematically influence people’s behavior. When companies use data\nabout everyday life situations to make both trivial and consequential automated\ndecisions about people, this may lead to discrimination, and reinforce\nor even worsen existing inequalities.","In spite of its omnipresence, only the tip\nof the iceberg of data and profiling activities is visible to individuals. Much\nof it remains opaque and barely understood by the vast majority of people. At\nthe same time, people have ever fewer options to resist the power of this\ndata ecosystem; opting out of pervasive tracking and profiling has\nessentially become synonymous with opting out of modern life. Although\ncorporate leaders argue that privacy\nis dead (while caring\na great deal about their own privacy), Mark Andrejevic suggests that people do indeed\nperceive the power asymmetries of today’s digital world, but feel “frustration\nover a sense of powerlessness in the face of increasingly sophisticated and\ncomprehensive forms of data collection and mining”.","In light of this, this report focused on\nthe actual practices and inner workings of the contemporary personal data industry.\nWhile the picture is becoming clearer, large parts of the systems in place\nstill remain in the dark. Enforcing transparency about corporate data practices\nremains a key prerequisite to resolving the massive information asymmetries\nbetween data companies and individuals. Hopefully this report’s findings will\nencourage further work by scholars, journalists, and others in the fields of\ncivil rights, data protection, consumer protection, and, ideally, also of\npolicymakers and the companies themselves.","In 1999, Lawrence Lessig famously predicted\nthat left to\nitself, cyberspace will become a perfect tool of control shaped primarily by\nthe “invisible hand” of the market. He suggested that we could “build, or\narchitect, or code cyberspace to protect values that we believe are\nfundamental, or we can build, or architect, or code cyberspace to allow those\nvalues to disappear”. Today, the latter has nearly been made reality by the\nbillions of dollars in venture capital poured into funding business models\nbased on the unscrupulous mass exploitation of data. The shortfall of privacy\nregulation in the US and the absence of its enforcement in Europe has actively\nimpeded the emergence of other kinds of digital innovation, that is, of\npractices, technologies, and business models that preserve freedom, democracy, social justice, and\nhuman dignity.","On a broader level, data protection\nlegislation alone will not mitigate the consequences that a data-driven world\nhas on individuals and society, whether in the US or Europe. While consent and choice are crucial\nprinciples to resolve some of the most urgent problems of intrusive data collection,\nthey can also produce an illusion\nof voluntariness. Besides additional regulatory\ninstruments such as anti-discrimination, consumer protection, and competition\nlaw, it will generally require a major collective effort to realize a\npositive vision for a future information society. Otherwise, we might soon end\nup in a society of pervasive digital social control, where privacy becomes – if\nit remains at all – a luxury commodity for the rich. The building blocks are already\nin place.","Further reading:","A more comprehensive take on the issues covered\nin the web publication above, as well as references and sources, can be found\nin the full report, available as a PDF\ndownload.","The 2016 report \"Networks of Control\" by Wolfie Christl\nand Sarah Spiekermann, which the current report is largely based on, is\navailable as a PDF download and as a printed book.","The production of this report, web materials, and illustrations was supported by the Open Society Foundations."],"isopubdate":"2017-06-08"}

Separately, the attorneys general for 37 U.S. states and territories sought details Monday on how Facebook monitored what app developers did with data collected on Facebook users and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse.","Facebook’s privacy practices have come under fire after revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn’t given explicit consent to sharing.","Facebook is also facing questions about reports that it collected years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and information about text messages from Android users. Facebook says the data is used “to improve people’s experience across Facebook” by helping to connect with others. But the company did not spell out exactly what it used the data for or why it needed it.","Mark Zuckerberg took out full-page ads to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. (The Canadian Press)","European officials also have also been investigating or seeking more information. Germany’s justice minister said Monday that she wants closer oversight of companies such as Facebook after a meeting with its executives about the abuse of users’ data. Last week, a U.K. parliamentary media committee summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about how Facebook uses data, while U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is investigating how Cambridge Analytica got the data.","The recent troubles follow Facebook’s most difficult year yet, as the company dealt with fake news, “filter bubbles” that lead to increasing divisions, and congressional hearings over Russian agents’ alleged use of social media to meddle with the 2016 presidential elections.","In January, Zuckerberg set fixing Facebook as his personal challenge for 2018. Nearly three months in, it seems like a tall order.","Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the U.S. probe would include whether the company engaged in “unfair acts” that cause “substantial injury” to consumers. Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances, though the FTC’s probe may extend to Facebook’s compliance with U.S.-EU principles for transferring data.","Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains “strongly committed” to protecting people’s information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC’s questions.","Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, believes Facebook was in violation of the 2011 settlement in letting Cambridge Analytica harvest data on friends of Facebook users. He called the investigation “good news.”","“This is what Facebook was doing 10 years ago that people objected to, what the FTC should have stopped in 2011,” Rotenberg said. “It makes zero sense that when a person downloads their apps, they have the ability to transfer the data of their friends.”","Although Zuckerberg talked about changes in 2014 that would have prevented this, Rotenberg said it should have been banned already under the 2011 consent decree. He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that.","Meanwhile, state attorneys general asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to control the privacy of their accounts more easily.","“Facebook has made promises about users’ privacy in the past, and we need to know that users can trust Facebook,” they wrote. “With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","In a statement, Facebook’s vice-president for state and local public policy, Will Castleberry, said the attorneys general “have raised important questions and we appreciate their interest.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

They would then use that data to do things like append their email lists.","“They came to office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side,” Davidsen tweeted.","Douglas Graham /CQ Roll Call/Getty","She added that she believes Facebook also recruits people “on the other side” too:","I am also 100% positive that Facebook activity recruits and staffs people that are on the other side.","Davidsen began the tweet thread with a link to a Time article outlining the Obama campaign's Facebook targeting campaign, which she said was codenamed “Project Taargus”:","That’s because the more than 1 million Obama backers who signed up for the [Facebook-based app] gave the campaign permission to look at their Facebook friend lists. In an instant, the campaign had a way to see the hidden young voters. Roughly 85% of those without a listed phone number could be found in the uploaded friend lists. What’s more, Facebook offered an ideal way to reach them. “People don’t trust campaigns. They don’t even trust media organizations,” says Goff. “Who do they trust? Their friends.”","The campaign called this effort targeted sharing. And in those final weeks of the campaign, the team blitzed the supporters who had signed up for the app with requests to share specific online content with specific friends simply by clicking a button. More than 600,000 supporters followed through with more than 5 million contacts, asking their friends to register to vote, give money, vote or look at a video designed to change their mind. A geek squad in Chicago created models from vast data sets to find the best approaches for each potential voter. “We are not just sending you a banner ad,” explains Dan Wagner, the Obama campaign’s 29-year-old head of analytics, who helped oversee the project. “We are giving you relevant information from your friends.”","Facebook did not immediately respond to IJR's request for comment.

Facebook said it was investigating the reports, which involved data consultancy Cambridge Analytica.","Over the past three-plus weeks, the situation has snowballed. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in Washington this week to testify before Congress. Meanwhile, the number of accounts affected has risen to 87 million from initial reports of 50 million. Separately, Facebook said it was purging pages linked to a Russian troll farm that's known for creating fake online identities and posting on both sides of politically divisive issues.","Cambridge Analytica reportedly acquired the data in a way that violated the social network's policies. It then reportedly tapped the information to build psychographic profiles of users and their friends, which were used for targeted political ads in the UK's Brexit referendum campaign, as well as by Trump's team during the 2016 US election.","Facebook says it told Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, but reports suggest the info wasn't destroyed. Cambridge Analytica says it complies with the social network's rules, only receives data \"obtained legally and fairly,\" and did wipe out the data Facebook is worried about.","Here's what you need to know.","Now playing:Watch this:\nDid Facebook lose control of your information?","3:28","What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a UK-based data analytics firm, whose parent company is Strategic Communication Laboratories. Cambridge Analytica helps political campaigns reach potential voters online. The firm combines data from multiple sources, including online information and polling, to build \"profiles\" of voters. It then uses computer programs to predict voter behavior, which could be influenced through specialized advertisements aimed at the voters.","\"We have lots of history of things,\" Nix said in the videos, \"I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done.\"","Nix has since been suspended from his job as CEO. His comments \"do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\" the company said in a statement.","What did Cambridge Analytica do?","Facebook said in a statement on March 16 that Cambridge Analytica received user data from Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge. Kogan reportedly created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" that ostensibly offered personality predictions to users while calling itself a research tool for psychologists.","The app asked users to log in using their Facebook accounts. As part of the login process, it asked for access to users' Facebook profiles, locations, what they liked on the service, and importantly, their friends' data as well.","Facebook's data appears to have been improperly used for political purposes during the UK's Brexit vote and the 2016 US presidential election.","Getty Images","The problem, Facebook says, is that Kogan then sent this user data to Cambridge Analytica without user permission, something that's against the social network's rules.","\"Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement.","Kogan didn't respond to requests for comment. The New York Times said he cited nondisclosure agreements and declined to provide details about what happened, saying his personality prediction program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","Cambridge Analytica also worked with other 2016 presidential election campaigns, according to its website and various media reports. Those included the campaigns of Sen. Ted Cruz and candidate Ben Carson, who went on to join Trump's cabinet as secretary of housing and urban development.","Why did Facebook ban Cambridge Analytica from its service?","Facebook said Cambridge Analytica \"certified\" three years ago it had deleted the information, as did Kogan. But since then, Facebook said, it's received reports that not all the user data was deleted. The New York Times reported at the outset of this controversy that at least some of it remains.","Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it deleted all the data and is in contact with Facebook about the issue.","\"I'm actually really confused by Facebook,\" Wylie said. \"They make me out to be this suspect or some kind of nefarious person.\"","Was Facebook hacked?","The New York Times characterized the original problem as a data \"breach\" and said it's \"one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history.\" That's in part because the roughly 270,000 users who gave Kogan access to their information allowed him to collect data on their friends as well. In total, more than 87 million Facebook users are said to have been affected.","Facebook, however, says that while Kogan mishandled its data, all the information Kogan got was accessed legally and within its rules. The problem is that Kogan was supposed to hold on to the information himself, not hand it over to Cambridge Analytica or anyone else. Because the information was accessed through normal means, Facebook disputes the characterization of the incident as a breach.","\"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" the company said.","Wait, so Facebook allows apps to access my data?","When you log in to an app using your Facebook account, the developer typically asks for access to information the social network has. Sometimes it's just your name and email address. Other times, it's your location and your friends' data too.","All this is pretty much what any app developer that works with Facebook was allowed to do until 2015, when Facebook prevented app developers from accessing friends' data. Everything else, though, is still fair game.","Facebook says its rules specify that developers can't share the information they receive with other firms. That's where the problem with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica comes up.","The company has an app review process it puts developers through. Once they're cleared, things are A-OK.","Facebook, by the way, is hoping to stop the next Cambridge Analytica. It's offered a bounty to anyone who finds apps that misuse Facebook data. The company has also revamped its tools to help you identify which apps have access to your data, as well as those to strengthen security of your profile. Facebook also made it easier to download data it has on you.","Could this lead to more regulation?","Zuckerberg himself said it might.","\"I'm actually not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" he said in an interview with CNN on March 21. \"The question is, what is the right regulation?\"","He answered that question on April 6, saying he supports the Honest Ads Act, a proposed law that would require tech companies to disclose how political ads are targeted and how much they cost.","Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are looking for answers from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.","James Martin/CNET","Regardless of whether that bill becomes a law, there's one thing we know for sure: The honeymoon between the tech industry and government is over. After decades of (mostly) treating tech companies as favored children, legislators and government regulators are increasingly taking a tougher stance against them.","\"This latest fiasco could reignite the debate within the Beltway and EU around a tighter regulatory environment Facebook and its social platform brethren could face going forward,\" Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, wrote in a note to investors right after the controversy erupted. \"This represents another critical period for Facebook to hand hold and assure its users and regulators around tighter content standards and platform security in light of this latest PR nightmare.\"","\"Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook,\" the agency said in a statement on March 26. \"Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.\"","The consent decree required that Facebook must get users to agree to and must notify them about the social network sharing their data. Facebook earlier told The Washington Post it rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","In Europe, where regulators have traditionally taken a tough stance on social media and privacy, the president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, tweeted that EU lawmakers \"will investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account.\" In the UK, Damian Collins, the chair of Parliament's committee overseeing digital matters, said Zuckerberg needs to stand up and answer questions directly.","What happened in Zuckerberg's appearance before Congress?","A little over three weeks after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg went to Washington, where over two days he endured 10 hours of questioning by congressional committees. Echoing earlier statements, he apologized to lawmakers for Facebook's recent missteps and voiced support for some regulation of the tech industry.","In his first day of testimony, he did score some points. Zuckerberg addressed a room full of Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committee members who struggled to understand what Facebook does, how the social platform works, and how to regulate it. He escaped largely unscathed, having settled into his role as both an explainer of technology and a receiver of the occasional finger-wag.","But on day two, things got a little rougher. His appearance before the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee was defined by pointed questions from lawmakers who appeared to have done their homework.","Some, like New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, hammered Zuckerberg on default privacy settings. California Rep. Anna Eshoo asked Zuckerberg if his own data was swept up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (He said that it was.) And Florida Rep. Kathy Castor and New Mexico Rep. Ben Lujan raised concerns about how much Facebook follows people as they browse the web -- and whether people without accounts on the social media network still get tracked via \"shadow profiles.\" Zuckerberg said that he wasn't familiar with that term and that Facebook collects data on nonusers for security purposes.","\"Your business is built on trust, and you're losing trust,\" Lujan said.","But apparently Facebook hasn't lost Wall Street's confidence. The company's shares rose approximately 5 percent over the two days of testimony.","Was this similar to what the Obama campaign did on Facebook?","Sort of. The Obama campaign did collect a similar level of data from its app, which includes both your information and your friend's information.","But as Politifact notes, users were willingly giving up that information and knew it was going to a political campaign. The Obama campaign used your friend's data to figure out who may or may not be willing to vote for him, and sent messages to users to persuade their friends.","That's different from the Cambridge Analytica situation, since most users taking the digital life quiz had no idea that the data would be used for political purposes.","What's Facebook doing about this?","After five long days, Zuckerberg broke his silence on March 21 with a nearly 1,000-word post on his Facebook page. (C'mon, did you really expect it to show up on Twitter?) The post was his first since since March 2, when he shared a photo of his family celebrating the Jewish holiday of Purim.","Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes with users' information. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data,\" he wrote. \"And if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.\"","He's since sat down for several media interviews, and on April 4, held an hour-long conference call with journalists. \"Life is learning from mistakes,\" Zuckerberg said. \"At the end of the day, this is my responsibility. I started this place, I run it, I'm responsible.\"","The company, he said, is now facing two central questions: \"Can we get our systems under control and second, can we make sure that our systems aren't used to undermine democracy,\" Zuckerberg said.","\"It's not enough to give people a voice, we have to make sure that people are not using that voice to spread disinformation,\" he added.","We have a responsibility to protect your data. And if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg","He's promised to investigate apps that had access to \"large amounts of information\" before the company made changes to how much information third-party apps could access in 2018. Facebook will conduct a full audit of apps that exhibit suspicious behavior and bar developers who don't agree to audits.","Facebook's public missteps have brought up other concerns about Facebook too. One example is a memo leaked to BuzzFeed penned by Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, a top Facebook executive. The 2016 memo advocates growth above everything else, regardless of whether people use Facebook to bully and harass one another.","\"The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good,\" he wrote at the time. He's since said he was trying to stir debate, and didn't agree with what he'd written.","The company is also planning to further restrict political advertising, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO, said in an interview with Bloomberg. \"If you were using hate-based language in ads for elections, we're drawing those lines much tighter and applying them uniformly,\" she said.","Last, Facebook will begin displaying a gauge at the top of your News Feed that lets you know which apps you've used and let you revoke their permissions.","We're also starting to see some action that could hit Facebook in the wallet. Within days of the scandal erupting, Firefox maker Mozilla said it would no longer advertise on Facebook because of data privacy concerns, and it launched a petition to ask the social network to improve its privacy settings. Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken a different kind of stand. Prompted by an inquiry from a Twitter user, he quickly deleted both companies' Facebook pages. So did Playboy, for what it's worth.","Ultimately, reform is what's needed, said former Cambridge Analytica executive Brittany Kaiser. \"For many years, I never questioned it,\" Kaiser said. \"That's the way that the political system works. That's the way that advertising works. That's the way that every single industry that exists in the entire basis of digital communications works. I do really understand the industry, and I have the ability to be a voice for change.\"","What can I do?","There isn't much. You may've been swept up in this without even knowing it. You don't have to have downloaded Kogan's app to have had your information accessed, since the statements and articles say the app slurped up information about users' friends.","Cambridge Analytica also doesn't appear to offer a way for you to request your information be removed from its systems. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.","As for Facebook, you can always try to lodge a complaint with Zuckerberg."],"isopubdate":"2018-04-18"}

The Facebook founder and CEO became $5 billion poorer in a matter of hours on Monday, and his net worth had dropped by nearly $4 billion more by midday on Tuesday.","Like most of the world’s richest people, Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth is determined largely by the rise and fall of the stock market. In particular, Zuckerberg’s wealth is based on the performance of Facebook shares.","Early on Monday, the company’s stock was down as much as 8%, as U.K. and U.S. politicians criticized Facebook and Zuckerberg for alleged data breaches that shared millions of users’ personal information. The data was reportedly used for political purposes during the 2016 U.S. presidential election season, which culminated in Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House.","When the market closed on Monday, Facebook stock was down roughly 7% for the day. And on Tuesday morning, Facebook shares fell another 5.5%.","According to Forbes “World’s Billionaires” list, which updates the estimated wealth of billionaires in real time, Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth was roughly $66 billion at around noon on Tuesday, compared to just under $75 billion when the stock market closed on Friday. In other words, Mark Zuckerberg has theoretically lost $9 billion in less than two days.","Facebook stock had since recovered, and as of Friday Zuckerberg’s wealth was up $2.5 billion for the year to date, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Yet as Facebook shares took a beating on Monday and Tuesday, Zuckerberg went into the red for year, with a theoretical drop in net worth of about $6 billion thus far in 2018.","The Facebook founder wasn’t the only tech billionaire hit with steep losses on Monday. Shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, were down 4%, and the net worths of company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had each fallen roughly $1.5 billion, according to Forbes. The world’s richest man, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, saw his wealth decrease by $2 billion on Monday as Amazon shares fell by nearly 3%.","But whereas Facebook shares have continued to fall on Tuesday, Amazon stock has recovered, up nearly 2% thus far for the day. The net worth of Jeff Bezos is up again as a consequence, increasing nearly $2 billion according to Forbes.","And overall, Jeff Bezos is having a much better 2018 than Mark Zuckerberg in terms of net worth.

One is that the Facebeook CEO feels “fundamentally uncomfortable sitting here in California in an office making content policy decisions for people around the world,” as he told Recode. This sentiment echoes his manifesto on the future of Facebook from earlier this year, in which he called for “a system of more local governance,” for the same reason: He can’t figure out by himself how to set standards of behavior for Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly active users.","It’s a sensible realization, and it wouldn’t be surprising if it came from anyone but Zuckerberg. This is the person, after all, who has managed to structure his company so as to retain monarchic powers despite being a minority owner. This is the company whose leading shareholders allowed that to happen. How would a company whose shareholders don’t even trust themselves ever enable meaningful user governance?","The current crisis of trust for Facebook should be a wake-up call that the tech giant—and others like it—need more appropriate structures of ownership and accountability.","Most of the talk about how to handle Facebook’s vast troves of valuable personal user data has revolved around regulation. Zuckerberg, along with Apple’s Tim Cook, have outright invited such oversight, and Europe’s new data protections are forcing them to plan for it anyway. Commentators from Steve Bannon to Zeynep Tufekci have called for Facebook to be treated as a public utility, like power companies and telecoms. Before legal advisors got the better of him, presumably, Zuckerberg himself used to refer to the company as a “social utility.”","Some well-placed rules might do a lot of good. But heavy regulation can also backfire. Think of what our most highly regulated, utility-scale industries look like—Comcast, PG&E, AT&T. Airlines. Big banks. Many of these are among the most hated companies out there. Zealous regulation can result in regulatory capture; a few big firms can afford enough lobbyists to write their own rules, which tend to be are so onerous that they make it impossible for smaller competitors to challenge the incumbents. Regulation thus ends up subsidizing the big firms’ investor-owners and reducing the incentive for providing quality service.","We might also consider whether governments, especially the ones we currently have, can be trusted to protect our personal data. The Department of Justice, for instance, is seeking rules to ensure its ability to access data on encrypted phones; Congress has permitted ISPs to sell their customers’ personal data.","There are other ways to imagine organizing a social network of Facebook’s scale—ways better aligned with Zuckerberg’s ambition of “local governance.” One of the few companies that rivals Facebook’s scope is the Associated Press, the newswire service that claims to reach over half the world’s population every day with its reports. The fact that we tend not to think of the AP in the same breath as Facebook is a signal of its success; the goal of a good platform should be that we don’t notice it.","The AP was formed in the 1840s as an association of New York City newspapers that needed to share resources like telegraph wires and horseback couriers. It has since endured its share of Facebook-like controversy; Upton Sinclair once called it “the most powerful and most sinister monopoly in America.” But a decisive turning point came with a 1945 Supreme Court decision that forced the AP to become a truly open-membership cooperative, owned and governed by the competing news agencies that use it, which run the ideological gamut from Fox News to the New York Times. It provides its member companies—including my local paper—with much-needed reportage from all over the world. In a moment of media polarization, the AP has stuck to the center by virtue of its diverse ownership structure—which is to say, the structure of its accountability.","Calls have been mounting for antitrust action against the new tech behemoths—not only Facebook, but also Amazon, Google, and others. Too rarely do these proposals involve fundamentally changing how the platforms are owned and governed.","One approach, following the AP example, would be to reorganize Facebook into an association of diverse, interoperable social networks among which users could choose. The central company would act as a kind of franchiser, managing the core technology and underlying infrastructure; the smaller member-owner companies would compete for users by offering varied options on matters of ad deployment, data standards, content filtering, and even interface design. Like the internet’s most essential and resilient social network—email—the result would be a blend of unity and diversity. Like AP, also, Facebook would be insulated from the day-to-day economic temptations of the ad business.","The technology for such “federated” social networks has existed for years; the trouble is that the allure of monopolism has so far prevented more competitive models from flourishing.","A second approach might involve a more direct form of user-ownership, in which the company as a whole remains unified but individual Facebook users, together, wield significant ownership and governance powers. This would be especially well-aligned with one of Zuckerberg’s stated ambitions: “I hope that we can explore examples of how collective decision-making might work at scale.” Handling such governance would not be easy, but already large-scale co-ops and mutuals—think REI and Northwestern Mutual—do a fairly good job of serving member interests without being toppled by the fleeting whims of the crowd. The electric utility co-ops that supply electricity to much of rural America receive consistently higher customer service ratings than their investor-owned counterparts. If companies like Facebook are going to hold the data of our daily lives, the surest route to security and a sustainable business is for us to hold a stake in those companies in turn.","The path to either of these outcomes is not easy or clear. They are goals to work toward, not short-term fixes. And achieving them will require a mix of policy intervention and ingenuity. Perhaps the process could begin with Zuckerberg's promised stock sell-off. One way or another, it is time to look beyond the ownership structures the online economy currently has to the ones we need for a healthier future.","The Cambridge Analytica case now plaguing Facebook is not a hack or a breach; it’s the rule, not an exception. It’s a symptom of a problem we already knew we had but were content to ignore. Facebook, Google, Amazon, and firms like them hold reams of data about us whose potential for abuse—if not now, in the future—may exceed the companies’ incentive to act in our interests. As online networks mature from dorm-room experiments to social utilities, our expectations should mature with them. Even Zuckerberg seems to realize that his network isn’t just his anymore. We give it value by acting like it is ours, by sharing our lives like it is ours. The nature of the company should reflect this."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The share plunge erased $5billion from the net worth of Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg as calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British firm hired by Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy called for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter. The two lawmakers said the companies “have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data” and that the lack of oversight “raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.”","Senator Ron Wyden asked Facebook to provide more information on what he called a “troubling” misuse of private data that could have been used to sway voters. Wyden said he wants to know how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook tools “to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.”","In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage. Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations “horrifying, if confirmed,” and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week. In Britain, parliamentary committee chair Damian Collins said both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had questions to answer.","“We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Collins said in a statement.

{"originalurl":"http://theweek.com/speedreads/763251/federal-trade-commission-confirms-probe-into-facebooks-privacy-practices","title":"Federal Trade Commission confirms probe into Facebook's privacy practices","text":["The Federal Trade Commission confirmed Monday that it has opened an investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. \"The FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook,\" the commission said in a statement.","Facebook faced fresh questions this weekend after Ars Technicareported that some users had found the site collected years of contact names, phone numbers, and text messages. Separately, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took out ads in major papers this weekend apologizing for the scandal surrounding Cambridge Analytica, a data firm alleged to have illicitly acquired and used information from the Facebook profiles of tens of millions of Americans.","When you're giving a speech, a joke can help win over your audience and add leavening to a weighty subject. Sometimes those jokes don't age well, though, like pretty much any joke involving a racial epithet. Or jokes about your high school's lifelong code of omertà when, a few years later, you're a Supreme Court nominee credibly accused of a violent and clumsy attempted rape in high school and your high school friend, the only witness to the alleged incident, says he has no memory of it happening.","On Tuesday, CNN unearthed a video of Judge Brett Kavanaugh making such a joke. \"Fortunately we had a good saying we've held firm to to this day,\" Kavanaugh said in a March 2015 speech at Catholic University of America's Columbus Law School: \"What happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep. That's been a good thing for all of us, I think.\" The joke is in the first part of the clip, and CNN's panel discusses it and the broader Kavanaugh imbroglio for a few minutes after that. Watch below. Peter Weber","On Tuesday, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a massive spending bill that funds the Defense Department and the Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services Departments for fiscal 2019 and also keeps the entire government open through Dec. 7, averting a government shutdown before the midterm elections. The House is expected to take up the measure next week, but because it does not include the money President Trump wants for his border wall, it is unclear if Trump will sign it. The government will partially shut down on Oct. 1 if Trump doesn't sign a stopgap spending bill.","The legislation the Senate passed 93 to 7 provides $606.5 billion for the Pentagon and $178 billion for Labor, Education, and HHS. Together, that accounts for more than 60 percent of discretionary spending. If the House approves and Trump signs the bill, Congress can wait to pass the seven remaining spending bills — out of 12 — by Dec. 7. Along with its stopgap spending measure, the Senate's Defense, Labor, Education, and HHS bill reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act until Dec. 7 and orders the Department of Homeland Security to submit a plan to Congress to reunited separated migrant families. Peter Weber","In her new book, Stormy Daniels writes about her night with President Trump \"in detail,\" Jimmy Fallon said on Tuesday's Tonight Show, pulling a face, \"which explains why every book comes with a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and a straw.\" He came up with creative ways to dance around Daniels' description of the president's \"Trump Tower.\" Because of her comparison of Trump's \"Don Jr.\" to a popular video game character, \"in the new Mario Kart, Toad collects gold coins and uses them as hush money,\" Fallon joked. He spliced together a clip of Trump \"setting the record straight\" on the matter.","Fallon then involved the studio audience in a game centered around Trump's slurred mispronunciation of certain words, joked about the Emmys proposal and Amazon's big plans for Alexa, and showed a viral video about a gender-reveal ceremony gone awry. Watch below. Peter Weber","\"While there have been a number of tell-alls about [President] Trump,\" Jimmy Kimmel said on Tuesday's Kimmel Live, the new memoir from porn actress Stormy Daniels \"is the first one that presents a detailed analysis of the president's genitalia.\" He read the entire description, which is as safe for work as network TV allows. \"And just like that, I will never eat a mushroom or play a video game again,\" Kimmel joked. Daniels also said that Hillary Clinton called Trump while they were together during the 2008 Democratic primary, and they discussed some mysterious \"plan.\"","Mid-joke, Tracy Morgan came out dressed in a suit and sporting Trump hair, an orange face, and tiny orange hands. He introduced himself as LaDonald Trump. \"Tracy, what is this?\" Kimmel asked. \"What are you doing?\" \"This is a hilarious new character I created, just go with it,\" he said. They bantered about LaDonald's wife, first lady Mesothelioma, and his vice president, Mike Pence.","\"I have to go, my nipples are getting itchy from the orange paint,\" Morgan said. \"You know, I told you you didn't need to paint your whole body,\" Kimmel interjected. \"I painted my whole body because I care about my craft,\" Morgan said, taking a little jab at his former 30 Rock co-star, now SNL's Trump impersonator: \"Suck it, Alec Baldwin.\" He ambled over to the curtain hiding Emmy winner Glenn Weiss and his new fiancée, Jan Friedlander Svendsen, and crawled in bed with them.","Earlier in the show, Kimmel had interviewed the happy couple about Weiss' marriage proposal during Monday night's Emmys ceremony. You can watch that below. Peter Weber","On Tuesday, the Supreme Court allowed a lower-court ruling to take effect that will require nonprofit advocacy groups to disclose the names of political donors at least through the 2018 midterm elections, handing a win to campaign finance reformers and a loss to Crossroads GPS and other nonprofits that specialize in using secret \"dark money\" donations to influence political campaigns.","\"With less than 50 days before this fall's congressional elections, the ruling has far-reaching consequences that could curtail the ability of major political players to raise money and force the disclosure of some of the country's wealthiest donors,\" The Washington Post reports. \"The change could affect heavyweight groups across the political spectrum, including the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity on the right and the League of Conservation Voters on the left.\" Conservatives were the ones complaining on Tuesday, characterizing Howell's ruling as an ill-timed incursion on free speech.","Starting Wednesday, the nonprofit advocacy groups will have to release the names of donors who contribute more than $200 annually for the purpose of influencing a federal election. Crossroads GPS will likely appeal the ruling, and the FEC will write a new rule for nonprofits, but neither of those will be in effect before the 2018 elections. The Supreme Court said Chief Justice John Roberts had referred the request for a stay to the court, which is divided 4-4 along ideological lines. The statement did not elaborate.

Depending on the time of year, the garden is overflowing with tomatoes, zucchini, squash, Swiss chard, and various herbs. Every week, a vegetable delivery — sometimes as much as 40 pounds — is brought straight from the garden to Miriam's Kitchen, where the produce is then given to people living in permanent supportive housing. The rest is prepared for homeless people who eat at a nearby church.","Recently, the students switched things up and started growing vegetables based on what Miriam's Kitchen specifically needs. Anything that doesn't go to Miriam's Kitchen is donated to George Washington University's on-campus food pantry. Senior Isabelle Moody told WTOP-FM the garden helps students understand the issue of food insecurity and \"think about what exists beyond GW's bubble.\" The garden is \"really special,\" senior Elizabeth Ferrante added, due to the way \"that it connects people.\" Catherine Garcia","As President Trump was leaving a Sept. 12 Congressional Medal of Honor Society event in the White House, Epoch Times photojournalist Samira Bouaou broke protocol by entering a restricted area and handing Trump a purple folder. \"Trump accepted the folder and appeared to open it briefly as he departed before quickly shutting it,\" The Washington Post reported Tuesday, citing several news photographers who witnessed the event. \"It was not clear what was inside the folder. Photographers who asked Bouaou afterward why she did it and what the folder contained said she declined to provide details.\"","White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has discussed Bouaou's folder situation with the White House Correspondents' Association executive board, and the White House has reviewed the incident, but nobody will say anything about it on the record. One White House official told the Post that the matter has been \"dealt with.\" Bouaou, who had recently received a Secret Service pass to attend White House briefings and other events, has not been seen at the White House since the encounter, other photographers say.","The Epoch Times, launched in New York in 2000 by a group of Chinese Americans, is believed to have close ties to the Falun Gong spiritual group, an affiliation the newspaper denies. Falun Gong and the Epoch Times are both banned in China. Ming Xia, a political science professor at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York, tells the Post that the newspaper's part-time journalists \"support the Falun Gong because they are Falun Gong practitioners. ... They are not professional journalists and they do not follow the protocols professional journalists abide by. That's how they can be very pushy and aggressive.\" Xia said the Falun Gong is eager to exploit Trump's hardline stance on Beijing. Peter Weber"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}
