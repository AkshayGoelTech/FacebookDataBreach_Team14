Former Head of Product @ Uber Developer Platform. Startup Advisor. Podcaster. Aussie living in both SF & Brisbane. Curious about everything","Mar 26","Do not #DeleteFacebook because of Cambridge Analytica","The ability to log into new apps with your Facebook or Google account and share some of your data is called data portability.","Data portability has become so fundamental to the way the open Internet works that it is taken for granted by most users and it is even enshrined in a new European law known as GDPR.","Today, however, the backlash against Facebook for its complicity in Cambridge Analytica’s use of FB data to affect the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential Election threatens to undermine and roll back some of the gains that we’ve all made for an open and interoperable Web.","Why is this a big deal?","Data portability is an essential, hard-won right of Internet users.","This right is based on the premise that users, not Facebook, own their data.This is a powerful and important idea. Data portability means that Internet companies aren’t allowed to lock users into their walled gardens. Instead they should provide ways for users to quickly and easily share their data with new apps they might want to use. This allows independent up-and-coming developers to build new kinds of innovative products and businesses. Ultimately this makes our lives and the Internet a richer and more open place.","Crucially, this is all done with full control and permission from the user.","The flip side of this is that those new apps have to be trustworthy with the data they receive. If they are not, it’s those bad apps that are to blame — not Facebook or the big ecosystem of services that mostly treat your data with respect.","How does it work?","You’ve probably participated in this data exchange many times.","You’ve likely clicked a ‘Login with Facebook’ button on a new app. Then you’ve been presented with a screen that explains that you’re about to share your data. You then clicked ‘allow’ for the exchange to continue.","This login and allow process is the method by which you ask services like Facebook to share your data with a 3rd party app so that it can give you some kind of new user experience or value. The app might be a game, a new kind of social network, a news site etc. It’s a similar process for countless other services that have a lot of your data and identity like Twitter, Instagram, Google etc.","But didn’t Facebook sell all our data to Cambridge Analytica?","No. Sadly much of the Cambridge Analytica controversy is the result of conflating many related but separate things together inciting a lot of fear, uncertainty and outrage.","Below, I will attempt to tease out and clarify some of these separate issues as succinctly and clearly as I can.","First, some history","Above I wrote that data portability was a hard-won right. This is because while, today, a user’s right and ability to share their data is taken for granted, in 2007, it was not obvious or inevitable.","While there were small groups of passionate, independent engineers working on great technology to make data portability possible — technologies like OpenID, OAuth and Portable Contacts — users were not aware of the value of their data and companies were unwilling to let their users port their data to other services.","The DataPortability Project Logo","To address this, I co-founded the DataPortability project with some of my friends. It was a non-profit initiative that worked to educate users about the value of their data while we pushed social networks to give their users the ability to connect, control, share and remix it for their own purpose. It reached its peak when, in January of 2008, we announced that Google and Facebook were joining the initiative.","To put a fine point on it, me and my friends were outspoken critics of social networks like Facebook for being one way data sinkholes. So my defense of them here might come as a surprise to some.","Thanks to its activity, the DataPortability Project helped to move the conversation forward in meaningful ways. It popularized the term data portability, raised awareness of its value, fired the imagination and forced uncomfortable conversations about user rights and data ownership between executives, technology leaders and journalists.","Ultimately it directly lead to the creation and adoption of features like the ‘Login with Facebook’ workflow I described above.","Selling data vs. data portability","Right now, many people are complaining that Facebook sold their data to Cambridge Analytica. This is not true.","Rather, Cambridge Analytica purchased the data from another company who had built a Quiz app that went viral. This Quiz app had the data because they built something that many users decided was fun and interesting to try. Upon hearing about it, they each instructed Facebook to share their data (and some of their friend’s data) with the Quiz app. This was something each user asked for and Facebook — as part of their compliance with the spirit of data portability and user rights — did what it was told. Facebook did not, and does not charge for this.","Further, the data was transferred from Facebook to the Quiz app under clear and standardized Facebook data usage policies that state that the Quiz app (and any other 3rd party app that engaged in the same process) must not store the data long-term or to sell it to 3rd parties. These policies are intended to (in so far as is possible) protect users from unforeseen uses of their data.","So what, in fact, has happened is that Facebook users trusted a 3rd party app with their data, and that app violated their trust.","Like with most things, there is a tension between Freedom/Rights and Responsibilities. Data portability gives users the right to share their data with apps they trust. But it also gives them the responsibility to choose apps worthy of that trust.","In this case, the Quiz app violated that trust (and the terms of service that FB imposed on them). While this is terrible and should be cause for litigation, it should not — as has been suggested — be a reason to roll back Facebook’s support of data portability.","Data and Attention based business models","The issue of data portability has also been conflated with the question of how an app should ethically use yourdata once it has possession of it.","Many are upset about the notion that if an app is free, then it is likely selling you and your data to other companies — in particular, advertisers.","The cartoon above illustrates this point better that I’ve ever been able to in 10 years of trying.","This is only partly true. Crucially, selling your Data and selling your Attention to advertisers are two different things.","Selling your data involves companies giving large portions of their data-set wholesale to other companies without your explicit permission. To be clear, this is not data portabilitybecause it is not done at the user’s request or with their direct consent. It is also not what Facebook did in this case.","However it is exactly what the Quiz app did! They wholesale sold the data they obtained from Facebook (with user permission) to Cambridge Analytica (without user permission). This is against FB’s Terms of Service.","Selling your attention is different. Your data is never actually given to the advertiser. Instead, Facebook, Google, Twitter etc, each have tools that allow companies to upload and target ads at you based on your profile data. The advertiser never actually gets your data, though. This is common and accepted practice for free online apps (not to mention radio stations, TV networks, roadside billboards, magazines etc).","Personally, I find selling data abhorrent.","Selling user attention via ads, however, is a fairly straightforward and time tested business model. Many users understand the implicit trade-off they’re making. Even if they can’t articulate it in technical or economic terms, and even if they may not know the full breadth and sophistication of the tools, they basically understand that they are getting free utility in return for seeing highly targeted advertising.","Neither of these things, however, are what Facebook did when it came to Cambridge Analytica.","Ethical uses of data, memes and targeting","Another aspect of this debate is the question of the ethical use of data that a company has legal and appropriate possession of.","Uses such as psychographic and demographic targeting, weaponizing memes, fake or exaggerated news are all ways in which your data — irrespective of how it has been obtained — can be used against you.","This is further complicated when foreign state actors get involved and democratic processes are materially affected.","Countless articles and analysis about this have already been written. My main interest here is to point out that this a much broader discussion about what we want to allow in our societies and how we can protect against foreign actors influencing our elections.","This is about issues of free speech, marketing ethics, geopolitics and war. It is not — strictly speaking — about data portability or even Facebook.","It’s also about education, but that’s a subject for another post.","What can be done to get this right?","While, in this case, Facebook is not responsible for selling user data to Cambridge Analytica, there is always more they can do to better safeguard and educate users. Some of these things are alluded to by Mark Zuckerberg in his apology (included in the image towards the top of this post). They include…","Introduce new, lower tiers of data sharing for apps that only need user IDs but don’t need access to any of a user’s profile.","Better audit the data access rights each app is requesting and ensure they are necessary for the proper functioning of the app.","Regularly remind users of the apps they have connected to Facebook and encourage them to perform some housekeeping.","Look out for apps that are getting a great deal of traction and ensure they are acting in good faith.","Better explain to users how the data exchange works.","Separate the Login flow from the data sharing flows — encourage users to pick and choose the data they share only when it’s needed for certain app features. This is similar to how iOS have to ask for camera access only when they need it (thanks to David Weekly for this idea)","Aggressively pursue companies that violate their data retention and re-sell policies to make the consequences prohibitively expensive.","What FB should not do, however, is remove (or make it prohibitively hard) the ability for legitimate, independent apps to access your rich profile data so that they can innovate and compete on an open Internet.","At the end of the day, though, there will always be some risk to user’s data. We must all take some responsibility for the apps we trust and choose to share our data with. Every right comes with responsibilities.","Finally, I’d like to suggest that we all need to more carefully choose our targets when it comes to outrage and mob justice. We live in difficult and uncertain times. We must carefully aim our anger and action so that the real enemies of progressive society are properly identified and dealt with — and that those dealings are effective. Facebook has clearly stepped up to take ownership for their part in recent events — have others?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Now. - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg need to come clean about 2016. Now.","Over the weekend, the New York Times and the Observer of London posted a blockbuster investigative piece revealing that Cambridge Analytica, the firm brought on by the Trump campaign to target voters online, used the data of tens of millions of people obtained from Facebook without proper disclosures or permission.","In the wake of this report, it’s more than past time for Mark Zuckerberg to testify to Congress about Facebook’s role in the 2016 elections and why he believes existing privacy laws are adequate to protect Americans from misuse and abuse of technology platforms.","And I mean Mark Zuckerberg. Not a Facebook lawyer, like the one the company sent to Congress last year for hearings on how fake news swamped tech platforms such as, oh, Facebook. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tweeted:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The investigation published by the Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica, after receiving $15 million from conservative donor Robert Mercer in 2014 to micro-target voters, obtained the information to do so in a questionable way. A British professor collected the information from Facebook, saying he was conducting an academic personality study. He did get the approval of about 270,000 people who signed up to take part in the study — they were told their information would be used. He did not, however, get the permission of the users’ friends, whose information was also gathered — an estimated 50 million people.","It’s not just that such an action is unethical. It might well be a violation of an agreement Facebook made with the federal government. Two former employees of the Federal Trade Commission have now told The Post that it’s quite possible that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement with the agency to notify and offer users an out when there is an effort to use their personal information in a way not in line with their privacy settings. This agreement was reached after consumer groups complained that Facebook was cavalier with personal information.","So back to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out, courtesy of a 2015 piece in the Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica and British academics had information on many users that agreed to such a collection, it demanded the information be destroyed. This did not happen. Facebook cited this when pressed on the latest revelations by the Times, claiming that the companies that misused the data “certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","(On Monday afternoon, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica agreed to a digital audit to prove it destroyed the disputed materials. The professors involved in using the data also agreed to an audit.)","And so, after the Times published its piece, Facebook didn’t own up to what happened. Instead, Facebook executives have gotten into a multiplespats with reporters and others over whether the Cambridge Analytica incident is a “breach” or a mere misuse of personal information, since some (but not all!) the people whose data was involved did give permission for their data to be taken and the company was not actually hacked. Facebook’s motive for this is almost certainly legal and regulatory. As Bloomberg News notes, a “breach” is a specific term that requires the company to notify users their information was illegally accessed.","But there is quite possibly a bigger motive. Painting Cambridge Analytica as the villain is an attempt to get Facebook off the hook for its ongoing role in everything from other invasions of privacy (more about that in a moment) to the ongoing complaints about its role in spreading fake news in the 2016 elections. If one or two rogue companies such as Cambridge Aanlytica — and not Facebook — are responsible for this mass misuse of data, perhaps the company can say more regulation is not needed.","But don’t fall for the idea that Facebook is not the problem. This is hardly a first-time offense for Facebook, which — a reminder — allowed fake news to flood many users’ news feeds in the months leading up to the 2016 elections.","In fact, Washington perhaps should have gotten interested in Facebook well before the Trump election contretemps. Over time, Facebook has indulged in numerous instances of dodgy behavior. There was the time Facebook altered news feeds to study whether they could affect the mood of people on the platform. There was the reveal that its platform permitted ad buyers to target people with such delightful terms as “jew hater.” And the discovery that Facebook made it possible to target housing ads to whites only.","Whether this latest scandal was a breach or a misuse of information is irrelevant. It was wrong. Zuckerberg needs to explain — slowly and clearly and without legal terminology or whiny excuses — what went wrong at the company he founded in his Harvard dorm room, and what steps the company is taking to make sure it never happens again. My suspicion? He can’t do that. Instead, a Zuckerberg appearance will demonstrate the need for significant federal regulation of large technology platforms.

Let’s pry off the lid and peer into the inner-workings of this “Data Machine.”","The Signal in the Noise","Building on the data analysis by @Conspirator0 on Twitter, Tea Pain has stumbled onto a possible “signal in the noise” that opens a window into the data-swappin’ shenanigans going on between Trump Tower, Spectrum Health and Russia’s Alfa Bank during the election.","Spectrum Health, owned by Michigan’s powerful Devos family, attempted to explain the IP activity as “Voice over IP traffic”, whereas Alfa Bank offered an even more exotic explanation that “hackers attempted to make it look like we contacted Trump Tower.”","The data traffic, when analyzed, tells a very different story, a story of automated, orchestrated data sharing among multiple sites for a strategic end.","Tea Pain originally dismissed this story as a possible red-herring. With the Russia craze at a fever pitch, this activity could be explained by what Tea’s daddy used to say, “When you got a new hammer, everything looks like a nail.” But when Tea Pain saw the data patterns analyzed by Conspiritor0, he knew he’d spotted something mighty familiar: Database Replication. Put a pin in that, more on that later.","At first, data analysts were puzzled by what appeared to be random activity with no apparent pattern. Perhaps it was email activity? Maybe money transfers? But there were literally thousands of these IP “pings.”","Once the activity was charted, a pattern emerged. For example, a connection is made from Alfa Bank to Trump Tower, which may last anywhere from 1 minute to 15 minutes or more, followed by a longer “sleep” period. When averaged over months, these events charted an average time between connections to be 3660 seconds, or 1 hour and 1 minute. Whatever was running, it would hook up, transfer data for a few minutes, then go to sleep for an hour.","This was the clue that led Tea Pain to formulate a much clearer working model to explain what we were all seeing: SQL Server Database Replication between multiple sites.","What Is Database Replication?","Database Replication is a rather simple concept. When you have a database with millions of records representing hundreds of gigabytes of data, and you would like to keep a copy of that database housed in 2 or more locations, it makes no sense to continually copy the entire database from point A to point B every time a change is made, so you “replicate” it.","This allows only the changes made to be sent from one database to another. This is accomplished by a process that runs on timely intervals, usually an hour, that wakes up and checks the changes made since the last hour and broadcasts those changes to the other database. The other database, in turn, check for its changes and broadcasts them in the other direction. Voila! Both databases are identical!","So what does the data traffic patterns suggest? Check out the chart below. Behold, Kushner’s “Stealth Data Machine.”","The white box illustrates the scope of data we can now observe. The bulk of the replication took place between Trump Tower and Alfa Bank, while smaller amounts of data were transferred between Trump Tower and Spectrum Health. If, for example, Trump Tower talked to Alfa Bank for 10 minutes, the next Spectrum-Trump Tower connection might last only one minute, indicating data replicated from Trump Tower to the Devos health care empire was being filtered, perhaps by “WHERE StateCode=’MI'” for example. But when changes were made at Spectrum, things looked very different.","Conspiritor0 noted that when Spectrum connected to Trump Tower, Trump Tower’s next connect time was significantly longer, indicating Spectrum had modified a large chunk of records that had to be synced to Trump Tower, then pushed on to Alfa Bank. This detail was important in identifying that replication was in use. In this scenario, Trump Tower was functioning as a center-point, a data distribution center if you will.","We don’t know what was in these data packets; that info is beyond our purview at this time, but ask yourself a simple question and you find your answer: “What do Trump Tower, the Devos Family and the Russians all have in common? A desire for Donald Trump to be President of the United States.","Tea Pain’s working theory is that Russia created a voter targeting database with information gleaned from hacked DNC data rolls and other data rolls “acquired” from other states to feed this growing contact database. That database originated at Russian Intelligence which was in turn replicated to Russia’s Alfa Bank. This is where the “data laundering” takes place, Alfa Bank is the pivot point where the FSB’s data fingerprints are wiped clean. Ironically Russia launders its data at the same place it launders its money.","At Trump Tower, more data could merged into this system using various legal sources as well. Spectrum Health could also add value to the data by matching names and addresses in their extensive healthcare databases to harvest email addresses and phone numbers to flesh out this list. All these changes would be promptly replicated back to Russia in a matter of hours.","Once back in the hands of Russian Intelligence, this massaged data could be programmatically matched up with social media handles to create a micro-targeted “hit list” for the thousand Russian trolls employed by Putin.","The Payoff","How is this a breakthrough? Now that we have identified the likely means of how this data was transferred, data analysts now have more precise points to search for to arrive at a complete reveal of the massive data collusion between Team Trump and America’s foremost adversary.","The “beauty” of this system is its simplicity. Here’s some bullet-points to sum up.","No special software needed. SQL Server is used in most every major enterprise. Replication is a built-in tool. No mysterious hidden processes, viruses, malware, etc.","Virtually undetectable. No one would blink an eye at data replication, a standard business practice.","Could all be set up remotely with only VPN credentials and remote desktop access, information that is often shared via routine third-party data audits. No one inside Trump Tower or Spectrum’s IT department need be involved. One Russian Intelligence data operative could set this up in less than an hour at each location. No low-level “conspirators” needed.","Value could be added to the data anywhere in the chain and it would promote back to Russian Intelligence within 2-3 hours.","All data-transmission would be out in the open, mixed in with the daily flow of business.","Even if found, the data would look benign, just names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social media handles, etc. No financial information. It would look just like a contact lead database purchased from any data-mining merchant.","Trump/Spectrum operatives and employees in the United States could interact with this list and have no clue the origins of the data were nefarious. This plain-sight approach was the key to its success.","297 thoughts on “Trump Tower’s “Stealth Russian Data Machine””","Comments navigation","Tea Pain… Your ‘user-friendly information layout was so incredibly easy to follow I think it’s right up Rachel Maddow’s alley.

They wouldn’t need them to troll Twitter. And they would be of no use with Facebook… UNLESS using those addresses to target FB ads to specific people.","When advertising on FB, you can upload email addresses, and FB then matches them to the appropriate UserID and shows your ads to that person.","If investigators really want to know if the Trump campaign was using stolen data, they should subpoena Facebook advertising records — then they can see exactly what data was used when targeting pro-Trump ads during the campaign, where the data came from, in what form it came (literally, the excel files containing the addresses), and who paid for the advertising.","An extremely easy way for Putin or ANYONE to support a political campaign on Facebook using unlimited funds is to simply buy advertising. You don’t even need bots.","If this data were a list of registered democratic voters, then if could be used for large scale disenfranchisement, e.g. By sending out voter confirmation cards and removing voters who didn’t respond quickly, as was done in many areas.","Since we know the Russians are in the hacking business, the email accounts of regular people could simply be another means to gain access to the contact lists of those folks whose email addresses they have, too. They could then bombard them with all sorts of things, whether it be a scam opportunity such as “You’ve won! Now click this link to collect your prize.” Or something like, “We’ve detected a virus on your computer, click here immediately!” If someone bites, they are in and controlling that computer. Let your imagination run wild with the options there.","simple-touriste: While following a link doesn’t necessarily automatically infect every computer that bites, that’s mostly because most people have some kind of malware protection installed, either as a separate utility, or part of their computer’s operating system, or they’re using a browser, like Chrome, that refers to a blacklist and warns users that they may be infected if they proceed. But there are plenty of people whose computers aren’t secure, for which following a link to a malicious web page can indeed automatically inject malware that can do whatever the malware was programmed to do. If there are no barriers on the computer that just bit, and if the malware has been written cleverly enough, it can steal data and indeed “take control”, at least in the sense of becoming a bot computer for whoever distributed the malware. If none of this were true, then there wouldn’t be any malware like this, but there obviously is.","Didn’t Kushner play “moneyball” with the campaign? Strategically targeted areas in states that could go red if you can convince voters. Then you have DNC voter information, rolls, etc. and enough misinformation to sway people through targeted attacks to question what is real in regards to the candidate of their party.","In today’s modern technology, if you have older voting systems, it should be fairly easy to hack. WI and all those special elections were not won fairly. There was vote tampering. Once Russia had all Democratic voters information they would know whose votes they had to manipulate. Then on voting day they would sync people voting with a Republican vote instead of a Democratic vote. Please note: More people are beginning to see that Trump has a strategic agenda to cry voter fraud, fake media, etc… which keeps us busy so that the nefarious plans can be implemented. We are not dealing with a forgetful 70 year old man. We are dealing with a skilled con-artist that has never taken the fall for anything. Every politician or staff in the White House or Congress have skeletons in their closet. Trump used the rebelation of Russia’s hacking as a means to intimidate all politicians.

There has been no valid explanation as to why he wanted it or what would be done with it.

All of the data including emails, CC info, personal data that is being shared could have been purchased legally through dozens of US data companies. I was in this business of marketing and I know I can buy all of this. So Trump Campaign and CA can claim they purchased or acquired all of this legally. My question is how can it be proven that “hacked data” entered the system? I have a theory that CA is the “front end” and legitimate business entity to a military grade targeting campaign.

And coincidentally, these precincts lack paper ballot backups in order to audit votes…","Unconnected machines require physical access, which would be extremely difficult to do—though not impossible, and only necessary to do in a few key locations. Fiddling with the actual registers of voters might be a bit easier.","Online Marketing costs money and anyone in that business will tell you it’s all about the Return On Investment.

This is part of protected medical info.","Not necessarily. Colluding with Russia to steal an election is treason, so I don’t believe they were concerned about pesky HIPAA violations. However; maybe that could be the driver to access the details of these transactions–investigating possible HIPAA violations.","Having worked on several healthcare systems, and on fixing problems from several HIPAA data breaches… It is considered to be a HIPAA violation if you disclose that someone is insured, or if that insurer shares personal data, which includes address and phone number, without the person specifically releasing it.

(There are far less risky ways to get all that information that wouldn’t be a HIPAA violation, but I think this is probably a case of billionaires saving money by using data they already have, confident it’ll never get out.)

The company runs a smartphone app for Android and iOS that maps discounts on the basis of user location. Users can open the app and see cash-back deals displayed on a map, similar to the way Uber and Lyft show the locations of nearby drivers.","Customers get cash back directly from GetUpside, which extracts a small fee from each deal it facilitates.","An initial test-run that was limited to D.C.-area gas stations has worked well enough that the company recently expanded its app to include grocery stores and restaurants.","“We’re seeing early signs that this could work in a big way,” said GetUpside co-founder Wayne Lin.","The brains behind GetUpside come from Google and Facebook. Lin and fellow founder Alex Kinnier are former Google employees who also worked at Opower, a local tech firm that was bought by Oracle for $532 million. GetUpside got some of its first seed capital from Formation 8, a technology investment fund founded by Gideon Yu, the former chief technology officer of Facebook. And Hal Varian, a widely published academic who is Google’s chief economist, is an investor and close adviser.","The discounts GetUpside offers can be pretty steep: up to 35 percent off for some restaurants, up to 25 cents cash back per gallon of gas for people using the app.","Such large discounts are made possible by the way GetUpside plays retailers off each other. In its gasoline app, the firm offers its services to just one station within each competitive cluster (whichever signs up with GetUpside first), shutting out its street-corner competitors.","Each consumer gets a different cash-back deal for a given location, making it impossible for that retailer’s competitors to find out the average price the retailer is getting through the app. Retailers can effectively lower their prices without their competitors finding out by exactly how much they are being undercut — effectively allowing the chosen gas stations to sidestep natural price competition, obscuring the “true price” of gas through the app.","GetUpside is far from a household name, but there are initial signs that it is gaining market traction. In late 2016, for instance, the app had only 5,000 downloads. Deals were limited to a few hundred D.C.-area gas stations, and the firm’s user base was mainly Uber drivers.","Now the app has 100,000 downloads and claims a total of 257,000 users in 10 cities. It employs about two dozen people, most of them working from home or from a WeWork co-working space in Chinatown. Lin says the business is growing quickly, although he declined to share revenue figures.","GetUpside has also been courting a different sort of investor. It recently raised $11 million from a group of investors that includes an oil company and a large financial-services firm, Lin says, declining to name them because of nondisclosure agreements.","The undisclosed petroleum company gets “some preference, but the preferences aren’t very strong” in terms of choosing which gas stations get to sign onto the app, Lin says. The gas company does not have access to GetUpside’s trove of vendor and customer data, something that could be meant to allay competitors’ concerns.","“They’re seeing an opportunity for them where we can help their stations make money at a regional and local level,” Lin said.","As the firm expands to grocery stores, it plans to apply that competitive dynamic, picking winners on individual blocks when stores compete for the same customers.","So far, the firm’s foothold in the grocery market is small. Just 15 D.C.-area grocery stores, including Harris Teeter and Streets Market & Cafe, display on the app.","GetUpside’s founders say they want to differentiate themselves from the daily-deals business by sticking to products that people absolutely need, such as food and fuel. But the difference is really in the data, they say.","Because discounts are processed by GetUpside and not the retailers, the company is able to show retailers exactly how much extra money they made through the partnership, managers say.","“Every customer gives incremental profit and we can prove that through the data that we use,” Lin said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

The boards were frequented by remote freelance workers who bid on “human intelligence tasks” in an online marketplace, called Mechanical Turk, controlled by Amazon. The “turkers,” as they’re known, tend to perform work that is rote and repetitive, like flagging pornographic images or digging through search engine results for email addresses. Most jobs pay between 1 and 15 cents. “Turking makes us our rent money and helps pay off debt,” one turker told The Intercept. Another turker has called the work “voluntary slave labor.”","The task posted by “Global Science Research” appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would “download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.”","“Our terms of service clearly prohibit misuse,” said a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services, by email. “When we learned of this activity back in 2015, we suspended the requester for violating our terms of service.”","Although Facebook’s early growth was driven by closed, exclusive networks at college and universities, it has gradually herded users to agree to increasingly permissive terms of service. By 2014, anything a user’s friends could see was also potentially visible to the developers of any app that they chose to download. Some of the turkers noticed that the Global Science Research app appeared to be taking advantage of Facebook’s porousness. “Someone can learn everything about you by looking at hundreds of pics, messages, friends, and likes,” warned one, writing on a message board. “More than you realize.” Others were more blasé. “I don’t put any info on FB,” one wrote. “Not even my real name … it’s backwards that people put sooo much info on Facebook, and then complain when their privacy is violated.”","In late 2015, the turkers began reporting that the Global Science Research survey had abruptly shut down. The Guardian had published a report that exposed exactly who the turkers were working for. Their data was being collected by Aleksandr Kogan, a young lecturer at Cambridge University. Kogan founded Global Science Research in 2014, after the university’s psychology department refused to allow him to use its own pool of data for commercial purposes. The data collection that Kogan undertook independent of the university was done on behalf of a military contractor called Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL. The company’s election division claims to use “data-driven messaging” as part of “delivering electoral success.”","SCL has a growing U.S. spin-off, called Cambridge Analytica, which was paid millions of dollars by Donald Trump’s campaign. Much of the money came from committees funded by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who reportedly has a large stake in Cambridge Analytica. For a time, one of Cambridge Analytica’s officers was Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s senior adviser. Months after Bannon claimed to have severed ties with the company, checks from the Trump campaign for Cambridge Analytica’s services continued to show up at one of Bannon’s addresses in Los Angeles.","“You can say Mr. Mercer declined to comment,” said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesperson for Robert Mercer, by email.","Facebook Elections signs in the media area at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Aug. 6, 2015, before the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election.","Photo: John Minchillo/AP","The Intercept interviewed five individuals familiar with Kogan’s work for SCL. All declined to be identified, citing concerns about an ongoing inquiry at Cambridge and fears of possible litigation. Two sources familiar with the SCL project told The Intercept that Kogan had arranged for more than 100,000 people to complete the Facebook survey and download an app. A third source with direct knowledge of the project said that Global Science Research obtained data from 185,000 survey participants as well as their Facebook friends. The source said that this group of 185,000 was recruited through a data company, not Mechanical Turk, and that it yielded 30 million usable profiles. No one in this larger group of 30 million knew that “likes” and demographic data from their Facebook profiles were being harvested by political operatives hired to influence American voters.","Kogan declined to comment. In late 2014, he gave a talk in Singapore in which he claimed to have “a sample of 50+ million individuals about whom we have the capacity to predict virtually any trait.” Global Science Research’s public filings for 2015 show the company holding 145,111 British pounds in its bank account. Kogan has since changed his name to Spectre. Writing online, he has said that he changed his name to Spectre after getting married. “My wife and I are both scientists and quite religious, and light is a strong symbol of both,” he explained.","The purpose of Kogan’s work was to develop an algorithm for the “national profiling capacity of American citizens” as part of SCL’s work on U.S. elections, according to an internal document signed by an SCL employee describing the research.","“We do not do any work with Facebook likes,” wrote Lindsey Platts, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica, in an email. The company currently “has no relationship with GSR,” Platts said.","“Cambridge Analytica does not comment on specific clients or projects,” she added when asked whether the company was involved with Global Science Research’s work in 2014 and 2015.","The Guardian, which was was the first to report on Cambridge Analytica’s work on U.S. elections, in late 2015, noted that the company drew on research “spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission.” Kogan disputed this at the time, telling The Guardian that his turker surveys had collected no more than “a couple of thousand responses” for any one client. While it is unclear how many responses Global Science Research obtained through Mechanical Turk and how many it recruited through a data company, all five of the sources interviewed by The Intercept confirmed that Kogan’s work on behalf of SCL involved collecting data from survey participants’ networks of Facebook friends, individuals who had not themselves consented to give their data to Global Science Research and were not aware that they were the objects of Kogan’s study. In September 2016, Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, said that the company built a model based on “hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans” filling out personality surveys, generating a “model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.”","Shortly after The Guardian published its 2015 article, Facebook contacted Global Science Research and requested that it delete the data it had taken from Facebook users. Facebook’s policies give Facebook the right to delete data gathered by any app deemed to be “negatively impacting the Platform.” The company believes that Kogan and SCL complied with the request, which was made during the Republican primary, before Cambridge Analytica switched over from Ted Cruz’s campaign to Donald Trump’s. It remains unclear what was ultimately done with the Facebook data, or whether any models or algorithms derived from it wound up being used by the Trump campaign.","In public, Facebook continues to maintain that whatever happened during the run-up to the election was business as usual. “Our investigation to date has not uncovered anything that suggests wrongdoing,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.","Facebook appears not to have considered Global Science Research’s data collection to have been a serious ethical lapse. Joseph Chancellor, Kogan’s main collaborator on the SCL project and a former co-owner of Global Science Research, is now employed by Facebook Research. “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.","Chancellor declined to comment.","Cambridge Analytica has marketed itself as classifying voters using five personality traits known as OCEAN — Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism — the same model used by University of Cambridge researchers for in-house, non-commercial research. The question of whether OCEAN made a difference in the presidential election remains unanswered. Some have argued that big data analytics is a magic bullet for drilling into the psychology of individual voters; others are more skeptical. The predictive power of Facebook likes is not in dispute. A 2013 study by three of Kogan’s former colleagues at the University of Cambridge showed that likes alone could predict race with 95 percent accuracy and political party with 85 percent accuracy. Less clear is their power as a tool for targeted persuasion; Cambridge Analytica has claimed that OCEAN scores can be used to drive voter and consumer behavior through “microtargeting,” meaning narrowly tailored messages. Nix has said that neurotic voters tend to be moved by “rational and fear-based” arguments, while introverted, agreeable voters are more susceptible to “tradition and habits and family and community.”","Dan Gillmor, director of the Knight Center at Arizona State University, said he was skeptical of the idea that the Trump campaign got a decisive edge from data analytics. But, he added, such techniques will likely become more effective in the future. “It’s reasonable to believe that sooner or later, we’re going to see widespread manipulation of people’s decision-making, including in elections, in ways that are more widespread and granular, but even less detectable than today,” he wrote in an email.","Donald Trump throws a hat to supporters during a campaign rally on Sept. 15, 2015, in Los Angeles.","Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","Trump’s circle has been open about its use of Facebook to influence the vote. Joel Pollak, an editor at Breitbart, writes in his campaign memoir about Trump’s “armies of Facebook ‘friends,’ … bypassing the gatekeepers in the traditional media.” Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, has written in his own campaign memoir about “geo-targeting” cities to deliver a debunked claim that Bill Clinton had fathered a child out of wedlock, and narrowing down the audience “based on preferences in music, age range, black culture, and other urban interests.”","Clinton, of course, had her own analytics effort, and digital market research is a normal part of any political campaign. But the quantity of data compiled on individuals during the run-up to the election is striking. Alexander Nix, head of Cambridge Analytica, has claimed to “have a massive database of 4-5,000 data points on every adult in America.” Immediately after the election, the company tried to take credit for the win, claiming that its data helped the Trump campaign set the candidate’s travel schedule and place online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times. Since then, the company has been de-emphasizing its reliance on psychological profiling.","The Information Commissioner’s Office, an official privacy watchdog within the British government, is now looking into whether Cambridge Analytica and similar companies might pose a risk to voters’ rights. The British inquiry was triggered by reports in The Observer of ties between Robert Mercer, Cambridge Analytica, and the Leave.EU campaign, which worked to persuade British voters to leave the European Union. While Nix has previously talked about the firm’s work for Leave.EU, Cambridge Analytica now denies that it had any paid role in the campaign.","Leave.EU signage is displayed in London on March 5, 2016.","Photo: Rex Features/AP Images","In the U.S., where privacy laws are looser, there is no investigation. Cambridge Analytica is said to be pitching its products to several federal agencies, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. SCL, its parent company, has new offices near the White House and has reportedly been advised by Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, on how to increase its federal business. (A spokesperson for Flynn denied that he had done any work for SCL.)","Years before the arrival of Kogan’s turkers, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg tried to address privacy concerns around the company’s controversial Beacon program, which quietly funneled data from outside websites into Facebook, often without Facebook users being aware of the process. Reflecting on Beacon, Zuckerberg attributed part of Facebook’s success to giving “people control over what and how they share information.” He said that he regretted making Beacon an “opt-out system instead of opt-in … if someone forgot to decline to share something, Beacon went ahead and still shared it with their friends.”","Seven years later, Facebook appears to have made the same mistake, but with far greater consequences. In mid-2014, however, Facebook announced a new review process, where the company would make sure that new apps asked only for data they would actually use. “People want more control,” the company said at that time. “It’s going to make a huge difference with building trust with your app’s audience.” Existing apps were given a full year to switch over to have Facebook review how they handled user data. By that time, Global Science Research already had what it needed.","Top photo: A collage of profile pictures makes up the Facebook logo on a wall at a Facebook Data Center in Forest City, N.C., in 2012.","We depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","FILE PHOTO - A Facebook logo is pictured at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 16, 2017. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted.”","FILE PHOTO: A Facebook sign is displayed at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 23, 2018.

Not least the rise in digital content both on proprietary news sites and across social media. As the bubble of wondrous digital stats has steadied (come on marketers if it sounds too good to be true…) and digital requires as much strategy as the next channel, the mounting scandal around the use of personal data by giants like Facebook is perhaps the start of a much greater shift in social trust in 2018.","Digital metrics have long sounded like the antithesis to expensive out of home (OOH) spend and traditional print media, which in the main has struggled to diversify enough to keep up with Millennial and Gen Z’s consumption rate and preferences.","So many digital agencies, particularly those that pride themselves on engaging youth, have lauded that ‘traditional media is dead’. But is it? There are growing numbers of indicators to suggest that there is a shift in these generations, where millennials perhaps stumbled into the delights of social privacy issues, digital footprints and fake news, and the next generation are far more sceptical.","Point-blank I’m not a fan of the phrase ‘digital native’, maybe I’ve watched too much Black Mirror. But it is the growing up with the internet and both the bounty and backlash it offers, which is the influence on the expectations and perception of content – both paid for and organic, that is the biggest challenge for content owners to navigate.","Fake News, that U.S. election and perhaps the unsurprising truth that big data on Facebook was easily manipulated to further serve and grow a multi-billion-pound organisation will do little to reengage an audience that has been slowly peeling away from the first social superpower.","For years we’ve been banging on about digital footprints, being careful what to post and this has seen a push from the traditional sites, to Snapchat and Instagram and a myriad of chat apps in between. In particular amongst youth audiences but more broadly people have been drifting away from Facebook. In light of recent news you can bet more accounts will close and privacy settings will certainly be adjusted.","When it comes to trusted content, this is where the shift is starting to happen and you can bet this is only the start when it comes to social trust in 2018.","Endelman Trust barometer 2018 highlighted a 61% increase in trust in traditional media, with younger audiences more cynical than the wider population over the validity and agenda of news on social media (cue more Facebook scandal, influencer payment reveals and fake news).","The UK Government’s ‘Growing Up With the Internet’ set out some the challenges we have in the laws and regulations playing catch up with the advances of social media","With the changes in algorithms on Facebook effecting content creators, we’ll be seeing more of this….","Buzzfeed are taking audiences’ out of Facebook into an app with push notifications and far more engagement with content","The Ferret, Scotland.

The company, best known for its work on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.","Shapiro surfaced a 2012 report from The Guardian that proclaimed Obama’s reelection team was mining data through Facebook to target specific voters.

This technology allowed the Obama campaign to access information of voters to figure out “which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote,” according to the paper.","“Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing,” ex-Obama campaign staffer Carol Davidsen tweeted on Sunday from her verified account.","\"As soon as Facebook realized that Cambridge Analytica had pursued a similar strategy, they suspended the firm.\"","“Not so with Trump.

And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android\nand Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for\naccess to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But\neven if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given\nit inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the\nway Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past.","Facebook denied the claim,\nwriting in a blog post: “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging\npeople’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not\nthe case.”","Facebook explained that users must opt in to share their mobile meta data.","It wrote:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using\nMessenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay\nconnected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better\nexperience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this\nfeature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can\nturn it off in settings, or here for\nFacebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared\nvia that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android,\nuploading this information has always been opt-in only.","However, Ars Technica questioned whether a service was really “opt\nin” if the opt-in was a default setting:","While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the\nopt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a\nseparate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly\nrevealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as\npart of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we\ntalked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about\nCambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data.","This latest spat over privacy protection comes as Facebook has launched a\nmajor effort to rebuild trust amid the unfolding Cambridge Analytica\nscandal, in which a third-party organization obtained millions of users’\ndata without their permission.","Facebook’s\npublic statement, posted on its press site, comes a couple of days after it\ntook out full page newspaper ads\nto apologize for the misuse of data by third-party apps as it copes with\nfallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal (follow the story as it\ndevelops\nhere). In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote “We\nhave a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t\ndeserve it.”","Some are demanding another apology—and a better explanation—from the social\nmedia company.","This time, the company has issued a statement saying it did nothing wrong.\nFor one thing, it emphasizes that while it may be storing data about every\nphone call and text, including who contacted whom, what time, and how long\nthe conversation was, it did not actually record the content of those\nconversations and texts. (Is that supposed to make us feel like our privacy\nhas been respected?

Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged.","Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March. The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.","Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.","Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users’ anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.","Facebook’s shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook’s lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.","Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018.

The Tories’ anti-Corbyn ad, focusing on his comments about shoot to kill, were seen in only about 100 seats.","Jag Singh, the founder of MessageSpace, which buys social media, internet and print advertising and provided services to the Conservative campaign, confirmed the Tories spent less money on Facebook ads rallying their own supporters than targeting ads at soft Labour voters.","That was based on voter prediction data provided by the party’s hired strategists, Lynton Crosby and Jim Messina, which suggested, even until Thursday morning, that May was on course to seize Labour seats.","Singh said: “That [tactic] was different to any other election I have been on, where you normally spend more money making sure your vote goes out.”","By contrast, on polling day Labour spent considerable money promoting its hashtag #forthemany on Twitter. Twitter is considered Labour’s online stronghold and while buying the rights to promote a single hashtag can cost as much as £50,000, the expense may have been worth it to rally the younger vote, which appears to have played a significant role in Labour’s performance.","“Labour had a positive, hopeful message,” Singh said, adding that a similar strategy was used by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the former US president Barack Obama, “and even with Trump”.","“It’s about building a movement, and social media can provide the glue for people to bound together. If your strategy is to poke holes in the other side you don’t evoke that emotion of togetherness which is an important factor in getting people to vote.”","Kenningham added: “There has been repeated talk about getting young people out to vote, but clearly this time Labour’s social media strategy worked. It energised people and got the base out.","“[The leftwing group] Momentum were pushing out slick attack ads which allowed the Labour party to stay above the fray and the Tories didn’t have the equivalent third-party campaigning group in the rightwing space. That was really important for attracting floating voters [who were] not engaging with parties.”","The Tories also failed to harness the rapid reaction capabilities of social media campaigning, according to Singh. Some adverts took as long as four days from production to publication.","“Unpreparedness,” he said, combined with a culture of strict message discipline made it hard for Tory campaigners to be as freewheeling with their online messaging as Labour."],"isopubdate":"2018-07-28"}

It says it has been doing so with users permission, but it’s not that simple.","People who explicitly “opted in” to allowing Facebook to harvest their cell phone data did so by agreeing to let the company import their phone contacts so they could use Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android phones — but it was not obvious to many users that they were agreeing to have their cell phone records logged when they agreed to import their contacts to use those apps on their Android phones.","The company defended itself by explaining that “people have to expressly agree to use” the opt-in feature for importing their contacts on Messenger or Facebook Lite to allow Facebook to collect the cell phone data, but Sunday’s statement is the first time the social media company actually spelled out that practice in clear terms for users.","“When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the statement reads. “For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or ‘skip’. If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information, which can be downloaded at any time using the Download Your Information tool.”","This circumspect cell phone data harvesting came to light via Twitter as users began posting their personal records downloaded from Facebook, offering incontrovertible evidence the company had indeed been collecting the data.","Oh wow my deleted Facebook Zip file contains info on every single phone cellphone call and text I made for about a year- cool totally not creepy.","The social media juggernaut does say that people who no longer want to use this opt-in feature can disable it in settings, and it claims that doing so triggers all of the call and text histories that were previously logged to be deleted.","“If, at any point, you no longer wish to continuously upload this information, you can easily turn this feature off in your settings,” the statement says. “You can also turn off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled.”","Facebook also said in its statement that users’ information “is securely stored and we do not sell this information to third parties,” but last week’s scandal involving U.K. political data firm Cambridge Analytica highlighted that the company has in fact been vulnerable to manipulation by the outside companies it voluntarily shares information with.","The company’s stock has dropped more than 14% in a little over a week since the news broke that Cambridge Analytica was improperly harvesting data via a third-party company that Facebook willingly gave user data to. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized in a statement on the social platform, as well as in a full-page newspaper ad, but the fallout appears to be continuing as the #DeleteFacebook hashtag continues to trend on social media, and high-profile users like Elon Musk delete their company pages.","SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT","You May Like","Read More","Sign Up for Our Newsletters","Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know now on politics, health, money and more"],"isopubdate":""}

If users had not adjusted their privacy settings on the social media outlet, however, the app didn’t just capture the survey responses — it also gathered as much data from each account as possible.","That data included information from Facebook users’ friends and contacts, as well.","“So by you filling out my survey I capture 300 records on average right,” Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. “And so that means that, all of a sudden, I only need to engage 50,000, 70,000, 100,000 people to get a really big data set really quickly, and it’s scaled really quickly. We were able to get upwards of 50 million plus Facebook records in the span of a couple of months.”","Similar stories based on the same reporting project also appeared in the New York Times and the Observer of London.","According to Wylie, the project was of particular importance to Steve Bannon, who later served as the chair of Trump’s campaign. He added that the former head of the right-wing media organization Breitbart wanted to use the data netted by Cambridge Analytica to influence and galvanize the views of the American public.","“Steve wanted weapons for his culture war, that’s what he wanted,” Wylie said.","“We offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do, which was change the culture of America,” Wylie added.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman refuted all of Wylie’s claims, calling his decision to speak to the media “a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","“We were forced to take action against Mr. Christopher Wylie to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property and he is the subject of restraining undertakings in this regard,” the spokesman said. “It is clear that he has a grudge to bear and appears set on trying to damage the company.”","But Wylie said in the initial interview that this wasn’t about getting back at Cambridge Analytica, noting that “if it was about revenge I could have done this years ago.”","Instead, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of research calls his whistleblowing a crisis of conscience.","“It weighs on me that I played a pivotal role in setting up a company that I think has done a lot of harm to the democratic process in a lot of countries,” Wylie said.","The idea behind the project was that political preferences can be predicted by personal details people voluntarily provide on their social media accounts. By analyzing the details that users share online, Cambridge Analytica could predict individual behavior, which included voter preferences and how to influence that preference.","“Whenever you go and you like something you are giving me a clue as to who you are as a person,” Wylie said. “And so all of this can be captured very easily and run through an algorithm that learns who you are.”","Wylie said that “almost none” of the people whose profiles were tapped were aware that Cambridge Analytica had harvested their data.","The research all began in 2013 at Cambridge University, according to ITN Channel 4 News, where the university’s psychometrics center began to examine the psychology behind Facebook and what information could be gleaned by pulling the data from user profiles.","According to Wylie, Bannon hoped to use that research and replicate it on a massive scale across the American electorate to buoy his influence campaign in 2014 and again in the 2016 presidential campaign. Billionaire Republican donors Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebecca — who own a portion of Cambridge Analytica — put Bannon in contact with the founder of the method, Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan, ITN Channel 4 News.","“Kogan didn’t make any money off of it, he didn’t,” Wylie said.","“He did it for free, and what he got out of it was the giant data set and what [Cambridge Analytica] got out of it was also data, everyone got data. But Cambridge Analytica paid for it directly.”","Cambridge Analytica appeared to lay the blame on Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), which is not associated with Cambridge University","“This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement issued Saturday.","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” the statement added.","According to ITN Channel 4 News, Kogan said he held the right to use the data for commercial purposes and did nothing wrong.","Meanwhile, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million to help target voters. The company told NBC News mere days before the 2016 election that it held data on 230 million American adults with approximately 4,000 “data points” on each of them.","The company denied, however, using any data that was harvested from Facebook via Kogan’s methods to help the Trump campaign.","“No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,” the company added in Saturday’s statement.","Facebook said in a statement that “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook.” The social media provider added that Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan had told the company that all the data initially obtained by the app had been destroyed.","“In light of new reports that the data was not destroyed, we are suspending these three parties from Facebook, pending further information,” Facebook said. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties.”","The social media company also insists that this did not constitute a data breach, as users technically consented — via their privacy settings — to allow Cambridge Analytica to harvest their data.","But Wylie does not think Facebook is completely innocent, as the social media giant first knew of the data gathering in 2015.","“Why Facebook didn’t, you know, make more enquiries when they started seeing that, you know, tens of millions of records were being pulled this way? I don’t know you’d have to ask Facebook that,” Wylie said. “But Facebook at least in a technical sense facilitated the project because they had applications that had these permissions in the first place.”","According to Wylie, Facebook never checked that they had deleted the data, only requiring that Cambridge Analytica fill out a form.","And thanks to the lack of oversight, this influence-peddling company was able to “move into the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before.”","And they did it in a way that entered a more than ethical grey area, according to Wylie, who claims they attempted to manipulate voters by latching onto their vulnerabilities.","“This gets at the heart of, you know, why is it that you’re taking this psychological approach?” he said. “Why is it that you need to study things like shame proneness in people? Why do you need to, you know, study neuroticism in people? What’s going to make them fearful?”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Cambridge Analytica harvested personal information from a huge swath of the electorate to develop techniques that were later used in the Trump campaign. (Andrew Testa / The New York Times)","Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.","Share story","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 U.S. midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social-media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s psychographic-modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge relied on the private Facebook data and still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month.","But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators, who are scrutinizing possible data-privacy violations and allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner said Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had contacted him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already dealing with intense criticism about the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Nix, a salesman, led the small-elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama’s campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Robert Mercer, one of the world’s richest men.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win.","When Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer-purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook.","The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","An international effort","Just as Kogan’s efforts were getting under way, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, a U.S. election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in U.S. elections.","In a memo to Bannon, Mercer and Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in U.S. elections. The data firm would also have to find U.S. citizens or green-card holders, Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision-making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green-card holders.” Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in a U.S. election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Cruz and then Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fundraising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview in December, Nix said the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","By early 2015, Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual-property claims. It characterized Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by The Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","But copies of the data remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","The scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work for the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” as he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on.","Gabriel J.X.

She called him \"the millennials' first great whistleblower.\"","Just after midday Saturday, Christopher Wylie tweeted: \"Here we go...\" The 28-year-old data scientist was about to be catapulted into the international media glare after blowing the whistle on an enormous Facebook data breach, which he had helped engineer.","The Canadian had been acting as a source for Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr for more than a year. He was feeding her stories about work undertaken by data firm Cambridge Analytica both in the US for President Donald Trump's election team, but also in Britain during the EU referendum.","A digital native with no qualifications — just talent","Wylie grew up in British Columbia, Canada, and was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, according to The Observer. He left school at age 16 without a single qualification to his name, but he quickly found himself in the world of politics thanks to his understanding of the internet.","The Observer said Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition by age 17, while a year later he went to \"learn all things data\" from former US President Barack Obama's national director of targeting.","By 19 he had taught himself to code, and then, at 20, he moved to the UK to study law at the London School of Economics.","Channel 4 News/YouTube","During his studies, Wylie worked on the side for British political party the Liberal Democrats, helping \"upgrade their databases and voter targeting,\" he said.","It was through his Lib Dem connections in 2013 that he was introduced to SCL Group, a subsidiary of which eventually went on to launch Cambridge Analytica.","It was while working for the Lib Dems that Wylie began to think about how \"personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour\" and Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix offered him a job and the chance to \"test out all your crazy ideas.\"","Wylie stepped into a world in which SCL Group was operating for the US's and UK's defence departments at the frontline of information warfare. It had also deployed psychological-operations tools during elections worldwide.","The Bannon connection","Steve Bannon, then the editor of Breitbart News who went on to lead Trump's election campaign, was told about SCL Group's election work while sitting next to a cyberwarfare expert on a plane, according to Wylie.","Bannon took the idea to hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who, after meeting Wylie and Nix, helped bankroll Cambridge Analytica.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" Wylie said.","Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014 and made Facebook aware of the data breach in 2016. \"All I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,\" Wylie said about the letter he received from the company's lawyers. \"Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.\"","In a lengthy statement Friday, Facebook said: \"Protecting people's information is at the heart of what we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook.\" Cambridge Analytica said the company \"fully complies with Facebook's terms of service\" and said it is working with Facebook to resolve the matter.","It remains to be seen if he is the millennials' first great whistleblower, but it was apt that his work was recognised by another famous whistleblower.

(Image: Sinclair Broadcast Group)","WASHINGTON (SBG) —","A number of Facebook users are changing their status with the social media giant from \"It's Complicated\" to \"Separated\" after learning the company mishandled user data and shared it with third-party developers.","For any public company, trust is its currency. The latest revelations of a massive user privacy breach at Facebook have raised new questions about whether the company can and should be trusted to responsibly manage the personal data of its more than 2.1 billion users.","#DeleteFacebook began trending last week after reports that Facebook allowed the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access the personal data of as many as 50 million users. According to admissions by Cambridge Analytica, the data was used to develop psychographic profiles to help political campaigns target voters.","In the aftermath of these revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a charm offensive, speaking with reporters, apologizing for mishandling user data and promising to do better in the future.","On Sunday, Zuckerberg took out a full-page ad in multiple U.S. newspapers that read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't we don't deserve it.\"","The ad referred to the Cambridge Analytica operation and the actions of a \"university researcher,\" Aleksandr Kogan, who developed a quiz app in 2014 on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Under Facebook's policy at the time, Kogan was able to pay for a feature called \"friends permission.\" That allowed him to harvest the data of 270,000 quiz-takers, who gave explicit consent to use their data, as well as the data that could be gleaned from their friend networks.","In his ad, Zuckerberg admitted that Kogan's app was not the only one that trawled large amounts of user information. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" Zuckerberg said. He concluded, \"Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\"","Some have taken note of the CEO's apology and applauded the company for taking steps to make its data-sharing policies more transparent. Zuckerberg and other executives at Facebook have published notices explaining steps they're taking to crack down on platform abuses as well as their efforts to make privacy settings more user-friendly.","Others have pointed to the fact that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user data.","\"Facebook says we don't sell your data, but they certainly provide access to it,\" observed Michelle De Mooy, director of the privacy and data project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.","Moreover, Facebook acknowledged that it knew about Cambridge Analytica's questionable contract with Kogan in 2015. At that time, they suspended Kogan and asked him to confirm that he had deleted the user data. According to reports, that user data remained accessible to Cambridge Analytica for years.","\"Facebook has been dragged, seemingly kicking and screaming into being more transparent,\" said Dave Levine, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \"Facebook has not done nearly as much as it could, simply by way of explanation to the public about its behaviors, about how your information or posts are curated, about what kind of data it collects and how it shares it.\"","The Cambridge Analytica breach is only the latest example of the company's opacity and delayed response to public outcry. Facebook has been at the center of the fake news controversy and spreading misinformation during the 2016 election. The company has been called before Congress over their role in facilitating Russian election interference and online terrorist recruitment. And the company finally acknowledged and changed their newsfeed policy after being caught suppressing conservative content.","Each scandal has temporarily hurt Facebook, but the latest scandal over violating users' privacy could be the one that tips the scales and imposes real costs and consequences on the social media giant.","\"Ultimately the problem here is one of trust,\" explained Julian Sanchez, privacy and technology fellow at the Cato Institute. If users no longer believe the company is responsibly handling their information or feel they cannot understand the company's policies for sharing their data, Zuckerberg's apologies will be \"too little, too late,\" Sanchez noted.","\"Once that's burned, once people don't have a sense of trust, I don't know if the specific policy changes will help much,\" he continued. \"Even if they really are making genuine improvements, as it appears they are, once that trust is gone, it's hard to get back.\"","In a new poll conducted in the days after the data sharing scandal erupted, Reuters/Ipsos found that the majority of respondents do not trust Facebook to handle their data.","Facebook was deemed the least trustworthy when it came to obeying laws that protect American's personal information when compared to other companies that gather user data like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo.","\"Maybe the poll is new, but the sentiment is not,\" De Mooy explained. The reason, she said, is that social media platforms \"are designed for opacity,\" intentionally making it harder for users to understand and make informed decisions about their data.","Facebook and other companies that rely on selling access to user data have had to walk a thin line between protecting their users' data and monetizing it. Consistently over recent years, polls have shown that even as users sign up and sign away some of the rights to their data, they are wary of how that information is being used.","Periodically, this concern has translated into relatively short-lived calls for people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, but it is not clear that those efforts have caused the company to fundamentally change how it operates.","\"If a few hundred-thousand people delete their Facebook accounts that will have a marginal impact on their bottom line,\" Levine noted. \"However if there is a reputational hit at the trust level, which is what Facebook needs to maintain in order to be a viable business, that cumulatively could create problems.\"","In recent weeks, Facebook has taken a significant hit with the markets valuing the breach of privacy and trust in the tens of billions. Since the story broke earlier this month, Facebook's stock has plunged more than 15 percent in a selling spree that has cost the company over $75 billion in market value.","Facebook could also be facing even more costs as the consumer protection watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy and data use policies based on the reports about the company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","The FTC already brought charges against Facebook in 2011 for what it termed \"deceptive privacy claims.\" At the time, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC and signed a consent decree which, among other things, required the company to obtain a user's explicit consent before allowing third parties to access their data. Moreover, the agreement required Facebook to inform users if they discovered they were unable to protect their data.","\"Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here,\" former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Jessica Rich told the Washington Post last week. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties.\"","If the FTC finds Facebook in violation of the consent decree, the company could face a $40,000 fine per violation. It is not clear whether that fine would apply to the alleged 50 million users whose data was shared inappropriately with Cambridge Analytica. In a statement to the Post, a Facebook spokesperson said the company rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","De Mooy said she is encouraged by the FTC investigation, emphasizing that \"the consent decrees need to be meaningful.\" However, she worries that regulators simply lack the enforcement authority when it comes to protecting consumer data.","In the United States, consumer data is largely governed by contracts and terms of use agreements between the consumer and the company. This approach is vastly different from the European Union, which will be implementing a new regime of privacy protections, the General Data Protection Regulation, beginning in May.","The new privacy regime will directly impact U.S. tech companies that will be required to be more transparent in informing consumers about their sharing practices in order to get consent. Companies that fail to protect user data can also expect to see millions of dollars in fines.","It is yet to be seen whether U.S. lawmakers, who have traditionally taken a lax approach to regulating internet companies, will take steps to strengthen data privacy protections."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement.","In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.","Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections","illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with Mark Zuckerberg’s secret police.”","Mr. Evans claimed that his encounter with Facebook’s investigation team led him to believe that chats he had with a journalist prior to his employment were accessed for an interrogation.","“When you first get to Facebook you are shocked at the level of transparency. You are trusted with a lot of stuff you don’t need access to,” he added. “The counterbalance to giving you this huge trusting environment is if anyone steps out of line, they’ll squash you like a bug.”","“Companies routinely use business records in workplace investigations, and we are no exception,” she told the newspaper.","The Guardian countered with testimony by a European Facebook content moderator. His contract allegedly gave the company “the right to monitor and record his social media activities, including his personal Facebook account, as well as emails, phone calls and internet use.”","The individual was also prepared to receive “random personal searches of his belongings including bags, briefcases and car while on company premises.”","Another former employee said USB keys were left around as “mouse traps” to test honesty and integrity.","“If you find a USB or something you’d have to give it in straight away,” the source said. “If you plugged it into a computer it would throw up a flare and you’d be instantly escorted out of the building. Everyone was paranoid. When we texted each other we’d use code if we needed to talk about work and meet up in person to talk about it in private.”","Ms. Thomson again said that Facebook acts within its legal purview.","“We do not use cellphones to track employee locations, nor do we track locations of people who do not work at Facebook, including reporters,” she said.","The newspaper concluded by mentioning Facebook’s decision to hire outside contractors like Pinkerton.","One service provided by the company includes sending “investigators to coffee shops or restaurants near a company’s campus to eavesdrop” on conversations.","“These tools are common, widespread, intrusive and legal,” said Al Gidari, consulting director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, the newspaper reported."],"isopubdate":""}

Obama was serving his first term as president. Google+ hadn’t arrived, let alone vanished again. Steve Jobs was still alive, as was Kim Jong Il. Facebook’s IPO hadn’t yet taken place, and its service was still fun to use—although it was littered with requests and demands from social games, like FarmVille and Pet Society.","I’d had enough of it—the click-farming games, for one, but also Facebook itself. Already in 2010, it felt like a malicious attention market where people treated friends as latent resources to be optimized. Compulsion rather than choice devoured people’s time. Apps like FarmVille sold relief for the artificial inconveniences they themselves had imposed.","In response, I made a satirical social game called Cow Clicker. Players clicked a cute cow, which mooed and scored a “click.” Six hours later, they could do so again. They could also invite friends’ cows to their pasture, buy virtual cows with real money, compete for status, click to send a real cow to the developing world from Oxfam, outsource clicks to their toddlers with a mobile app, and much more. It became strangely popular, until eventually, I shut the whole thing down in a bovine rapture—the “cowpocalypse.” It’s kind of a complicated story.","But one worth revisiting today, in the context of the scandal over Facebook’s sanctioning of user-data exfiltration via its application platform. It’s not just that abusing the Facebook platform for deliberately nefarious ends was easy to do (it was). But worse, in those days, it was hard to avoid extracting private data, for years even, without even trying. I did it with a silly cow game.","* * *","Cow Clicker is not an impressive work of software. After all, it was a game whose sole activity was clicking on cows. I wrote the principal code in three days, much of it hunched on a friend’s couch in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I had no idea anyone would play it, although over 180,000 people did, eventually. I made a little money from the whole affair, but I never optimized it for revenue generation. I certainly never pondered using the app as a lure for a data-extraction con. I was just a strange man making a strange game on a lark.","And yet, if you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior. I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood, before my caprice raptured them into the digital void.","The authorization dialog for the game Candy Crush. (King / Facebook)","To understand why withdrawing data was the default behavior in Facebook apps, you have to know something about how apps get made and published on Facebook. In 2007, the company turned its social-network service into an application platform. The idea was that Facebook could grow its number of users and the time they spent engaged by allowing people and organizations to build services overtop of it. And those people and organizations would benefit by plugging into a large network of users, whose network of friends could easily be made a part of the service, both for social interaction and viral spread.","When you access an app on Facebook’s website, be it a personality-quiz, a game, a horoscope, or a sports community, the service presents you with an authorization dialog, where the specific data an app says it needs is displayed for the user’s consideration. That could be anything from your name, friend list, and email address, to your photos, likes, direct messages and more.","The information shared with an app by default has changed over time, and even a savvy user might never have known what comprised it. When I launched Cow Clicker in 2010, it was easier to acquire both “basic” information (name, gender, networks, and profile picture) and “extended” user information (location, relationship status, likes, posts, and more). In 2014, Facebook began an app review process for information beyond that which a user shared publicly, but for years before that, the decision was left to the user alone. This is consistent with Facebook’s longstanding, official policy on privacy, which revolves around user control rather than procedural verification.","App authorizations are not exceptionally clear. For one thing, the user must accept the app’s request to share data with it as soon as they open it for the first time, even before knowing what the app does or why. For another, the authorization is presented by Facebook, not by the third party, making it seem official, safe, and even endorsed.","Cow Clicker on Facebook, 2010. The game appears to live natively inside the Facebook interface, but it runs—and stores its data—on a separate server. (Cow Clicker / Ian Bogost / The Atlantic)","The part of the Facebook website where apps appear, under the blue top navigation (as seen above), introduces further confusion. To the average web user, especially a decade ago, it looked like the game or app was just a part of Facebook itself. The page is seamless, with no boundary between the site’s navigational chrome and the third-party app. If you look at the browser address bar while using a Facebook app on the website, the URL begins with “apps.facebook.com,” further cementing the impression that the user was safely ensconced in the comforting, blue cradle of Facebook’s care.","That’s not what really takes place. When a user loads an app, Facebook’s servers pass those requests to a remote computer, where the individual or company that made the app hosts their services. The app sends its responses to Facebook, which formats and presents them to the user, as if they were inside of Facebook itself.","The authorization process happens once, the first time the app is accessed for a specific user. After that, every time the user loads the app, Facebook sends it a payload of basic user data to facilitate the app’s operation (additional data can be requested separately when needed). For years, these transmissions were even conducted unencrypted, until Facebook required apps to communicate with its service over a secure connection.","Beyond its own terms of service for applications, which many developers probably didn’t read or feel compelled to heed, Facebook “secured” user data shared with third-parties by requiring every app to publish a privacy policy. Because data sharing was seen as a form of user-control, not corporate policy, Facebook doesn’t appear to review platform-developer privacy policies. As far as I can tell, all the platform did was to insure that accessing the URL for an app’s privacy policy didn’t result in a page-not-found error. Facebook was checking that privacy policies existed as reachable web pages, not that they existed as privacy policies, let alone policies that provided any specific protections. And besides, users probably never read the policies, which were linked unassumingly from the application-permissions interface. They might easily, and reasonably, have assumed that Facebook was simply reiterating its own privacy policy when presenting new access to an app. They would have been wrong.","In essence, Facebook was presenting apps as quasi-endorsed extensions of its core service to users who couldn’t have been expected to know better. That might explain why so many people feel violated by Facebook this week—they might never have realized that they were even using foreign, non-Facebook applications in the first place, let alone ones that were siphoning off and selling their data. The website always just looked like Facebook.","In the case of Cow Clicker, which only ever aimed to let people click on pictures of cows, I was able to access two potentially sensitive pieces of data without even trying.","The first is a player’s Facebook ID. This is a numeric, unique identifier attached to every Facebook account. Once I have your Facebook ID, I can look up your profile programmatically, or I can just load it in the public website by appending it to “facebook.com”—Mark Zuckerberg’s is 4.","These days, Facebook generates a unique, app-specific ID for each user, in order to prevent an app from connecting someone directly to Facebook profiles. But back in Cow Clicker’s heyday of 2010, Facebook didn’t do this, and every app got your actual ID. Those data could be correlated against other information—data collected from Facebook, fashioned by the app, or acquired elsewhere. Because I collected and stored my users’ true Facebook IDs to be able to count their clicks and build their pastures and the like, I still have them, and, in theory, I could use them nefariously. A 2014 terms-of-service update prohibits some of that activity, but not everyone cares about violating the Facebook terms of service.","The second type of information is a piece of profile data Cow Clicker received without asking for it. Back in 2010, Facebook still allowed users to join “networks”—affiliations like schools, workplaces, and organizations. In some cases, those affiliations required authorization, for example having an email address at a domain that corresponds with a university. Over time, verification became less important to Facebook, and now users can affiliate with schools or workplaces arbitrarily. The less friction, the more data.","In 2010, on my friend’s couch in Brooklyn, I noticed that Facebook was shipping user affiliation data over the wire to me, so I decided to store it. Facebook allowed apps to store data for which user permission was granted, but urged developers not to request or store more than it needed to operate. Putting affiliation data in the Cow Clicker database allowed me to provide leaderboard rankings by network, allowing my players to compete for clicks with their work colleagues or classmates.","That’s neither a terribly interesting feature nor a particularly wicked one. But because I stored the numerical identifiers for user affiliations, I still have them. Until 2016, I could use a database-query tool called FQL, Facebook Query Language, to retrieve the details of those networks, and correlate them back to my users. Had I wanted to, I could have recombined that information with other data and used it for retargeting.","Cow Clicker’s example is so modest, it might not even seem like a problem. What does it matter if a simple diversion has your Facebook ID, education, and work affiliations? Especially since its solo creator (that’s me) was too dumb or too lazy to exploit that data toward pernicious ends. But even if I hadn’t thought about it at the time, I could have done so years later, long after the cows vanished, and once Cow Clicker players forgot that they’d ever installed my app.","This is also why Zuckerberg’s response to the present controversy feels so toothless. Facebook has vowed to audit companies that have collected, shared, or sold large volumes of data in violation of its policy, but the company cannot close the Pandora’s box it opened a decade ago, when it first allowed external apps to collect Facebook user data. That information is now in the hands of thousands, maybe millions of people.","To be honest, I’m not even sure I know what the Facebook platform’s terms of service dictated that I do with user data acquired from Facebook. Technically, users could revoke certain app permissions later, and apps were supposed to remove any impacted data that they had stored. I doubt most apps did that, and I suspect users never knew—and still don’t know—that revoking access to an app they used eight years ago doesn’t do anything to reverse transmissions that took place years ago.","As Jason Koebler put it at Motherboard, it’s too late. “If your data has already been taken, Facebook has no mechanism and no power to make people delete it. If your data was taken, it has very likely been sold, laundered, and put back into Facebook.” Indeed, all the publicity around Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica crisis might be sending lots of old app developers, like me, back to old code and dusty databases, wondering what they’ve even got stored and what it might yet be worth.","Facebook’s laissez-faire openness surely contributed to the data-extraction free-for-all that’s playing itself out now via the example of Cambridge Analytica. But so did its move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development. The Facebook platform was truly a nightmare to use and to maintain. It was built like no other software system then extant, and it changed constantly—regular updates rolled out weekly. Old code broke, seemingly for no good reason. Some Facebook app developers were dishonest from the start, and others couldn’t help themselves once they saw the enormous volume of data they could slurp from millions or tens of millions of Facebook users. But many more were just struggling to eke out a part of their living in an ecosystem where people might discover them.","Millions of apps had been created by 2012, when I hung up my cowboy hat. Not only apps apparently designed with duplicity in mind, like Aleksandr Kogan’s personality-quiz, which extracted data that was then sold to Cambridge Analytica. But hundreds of thousands of creators of dumb toys, quizzes, games, and communities that might never have intended to dupe or violate users surely did so anyway, because Facebook rammed their data down our throats. On the whole, none of us asked for your data. But we have it anyway, and forever.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

With almost 2 billion users, Facebook customizes the audience for its millions of advertisers based on its vast trove of personalized user data. After being warned repeatedly about its discriminatory advertising practices, Facebook continues to use this data to deny people access to rental housing and real estate sales ads because of their sex and family status.","In addition to NFHA, the Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are the New York City-based Fair Housing Justice Center (“FHJC”); Housing Opportunities Project for Excellence, Inc. (“HOPE”) in Miami, Florida; and the Fair Housing Council of Greater San Antonio (“FHCGSA”). All four Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations with the common mission of eliminating housing discrimination and promoting residential integration. Plaintiffs are represented by Diane L. Houk, Katherine Rosenfeld, and David Berman of the New York City-based civil rights law firm of Emery Celli Brinkerhoff & Abady LLP (“ECBA”).","The lawsuit alleges that Facebook has created pre-populated lists that make it possible for its housing advertisers to “exclude” (in Facebook terminology) home seekers from viewing or receiving rental or sales ads because of protected characteristics, including family status and sex. Plaintiffs conducted investigations in each of their respective housing markets that confirmed Facebook’s discriminatory practices.","Plaintiffs created a non-existent realty firm and then prepared dozens of housing advertisements that they submitted to Facebook for review. Facebook provided Plaintiffs with specific lists of groups they could exclude from receiving the ads, including families with children, moms with children of certain ages, women or men, and other categories based on sex or family status. The investigations also revealed that Facebook provides housing advertisers with the ability to exclude certain “interest” categories from receiving ads that are disability-based (e.g., people who are interested in disabled veterans or disabled parking permits) or national origin-based (e.g., people who are interested in English as a second language). Starting in 2016, an investigation by the news organization ProPublica found that Facebook’s ad platform permitted advertisers for a variety of goods and services, including housing, to exclude African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans from receiving ads. As the Complaint explains, while Facebook has recently removed some of these options, it continues to violate fair housing laws that prohibit discrimination in other ways.","“Amid growing public concern in the past weeks that Facebook has mishandled users’ data, our investigation shows that Facebook also allows and even encourages its paid advertisers to discriminate using its vast trove of personal data,” said Lisa Rice, NFHA’s President and CEO. “Facebook’s use and abuse of user data for discriminatory purposes needs to stop. It is already a challenge for women, families with children, people with disabilities and other under-served groups to find housing. Facebook’s platform that excludes these consumers from ever seeing certain ads to rent or buy housing must be changed immediately. Facebook ought to be opening doors to housing opportunities instead of closing them,” Rice added.","FHJC’s Executive Director Fred Freiberg stated, “Facebook enables a real estate company or landlord to discriminate by selectively targeting housing advertisements to exclude specific populations.” Freiberg added, “Facebook’s platform is the virtual equivalent of posting a for-rent sign that says No Families with Young Kids or No Women, but it does so in an insidious and stealth manner so that people have no clue they have been excluded on the basis of family status or sex.”","“The illegal exclusion of women and children from housing opportunities should never be an option,” said Keenya Robertson, President and CEO of HOPE, Inc. “Such an option should not only trigger one’s sense of right and wrong, but simply offend one’s common sense.”","“This year is the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, the final great legislative achievement of the civil rights era,” said Sandra Tamez, FHCGSA’s Executive Director. “We are still fighting to increase housing opportunities for historically excluded groups such as women with children and persons of color, and to end the discrimination in advertising that persists today, albeit in new forms on Facebook and other online platforms.”","“Facebook has known for years that its advertising platform violates civil rights laws, but it has refused to change its ways on a voluntary basis,” said Diane L. Houk, one of Plaintiffs’ attorneys. “Facebook is not above the law and must answer these civil rights claims in court.”","“Facebook announced this year that its new mission is to bring the world closer together, but this remains empty corporate jargon as long as Facebook discriminates in its ad platform,” said Katherine Rosenfeld, another of Plaintiffs’ attorneys. “If Facebook truly wants to bring the world closer together, it could start tomorrow by giving female-headed families with children equal access to Facebook advertisements for apartment rentals.”","Declare that the practice of excluding Facebook users from receiving housing ads on the basis of sex, family status, and any other legally protected categories violates the Fair Housing Act and the New York City Human Rights Law;","Issue an injunction barring Facebook from continuing to engage in discriminatory housing advertising; and","Require Facebook to change its advertising platform and its practices to comply with fair housing laws, including by eliminating checkboxes, selection categories, and other content that enable advertisers to restrict access to housing advertisements.","– ### –","Founded in 1988, the National Fair Housing Alliance is a consortium of more than 220 private, non-profit fair housing organizations, state and local civil rights agencies, and individuals from throughout the United States.

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","On March 17, reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London suggested Trump-campaign linked UK-based political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had been able to buy data on 50 million Facebook users in 2015 to use for microtarging political advertising.","The data had been gathered via a third party survey app running on Facebook’s platform and using its API to pull data on the friends of the 270,000 respondents who answered the survey.","At the weekend Facebook took out full page newspaper ads in the US and UK apologizing for failing to protect users’ information.","Billions have been wiped off the company’s share price since the scandal broke.","The company’s share price also fell more than 5% today, on the news of the FTC announcement.","The consumer watchdog previously investigated Facebook over deceptive privacy claims, back in 2011.","And in 2012, as part of an FTC settlement, Facebook promised it would give users “clear and prominent notice” and get their consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.","It also agree to two decades of biennial audits.","Facebook avoided a financial penalty at the time, though if the FTC goes on to decide the company violated that earlier initial agreement it could certainly be on the hook for fines — fines which the Washington Post has suggested could scale to trillions of dollars if the FTC’s $40,000 per privacy violation is multiplied by the 50M Facebook users whose data was passed to Cambridge Analytica.","Whatever any eventual financial penalty might be, the reputational damage Facebook is suffering as a result of this snowballing data handling scandal is bad enough, adding to calls for policymakers to regulate social media platforms.","We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the FTC’s announcement — at the time of writing the company had not responded.","I am a self‐learned digital executive, leader, strategist and trainer by profession and experience.

Each topic-based CommunityVoice™ is produced and managed by the group.","Opinions expressed within Forbes CommunityVoice™ are those of the participating individuals.","Mar 27, 2018, 09:00am","What Does EU's General Data Protection Regulation Mean For American Brands?","After years of negotiation and legal challenges, on May 25, 2018, the European Union will officially impose the complete requirements of its sweeping online privacy legislation known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Designed to protect the digital security of citizens within the EU, it’s a radical policy that limits how online brands collect personal data about their consumers.","Coming at a time when brands spend billions of dollars per year leveraging user data to segment and personalize online ads and campaigns, GDPR easily qualifies as one of the most impactful policies in the constantly evolving history of digital marketing. The reason is it doesn’t just apply to European businesses; this pertains to virtually any business that markets to international audiences.","The fact of the matter is if you thought your company was exempt because it’s based in the U.S., think again. If, as an agency, publisher or brand, any aspect of your marketing targets citizens of the EU, failure to comply with strict privacy regulations can result in hefty fines and severe penalties.","As the head of a digital agency working primarily with luxury hotels — and whose target audiences often reside within the EU — GDPR has naturally been a hot topic within my client circle in recent months. However the regulation may impact you, here’s a cheat sheet for staying on the right side of new laws set to take effect in late May.","What is it?","The product of a 2012 European Commission initiative to place increasing protections on personal data, GDPR is meant to shift online laws and regulations in favor of individuals, not businesses. Any company that touches the personal data of European consumers must not only handle it with extreme care but also offer consumers the option to control and eliminate any information pertaining to them. It satisfies the fundamental “right to be forgotten,” based on the notion that “the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right.”","In order to do so, GDPR requires public authorities and companies tracking online behavior (for marketing purposes) to appoint a data protection officer (DPO). Dedicated specifically to GDPR compliance, these employees are hired to manage the company’s data protection processes, train other employees in data protection, conduct internal audits, report to the company’s top executives and serve as the first point of contact for regulatory agencies.","GDPR also requires a complete optimization of a company’s data collection process. A big component of this is transparency, obligating companies to report, identify and investigate data breaches, as well as communicate privacy information to the consumers themselves (essentially proving their lawful means for obtaining user data). Company data policies must also cover individual rights (allowing users to change, edit or delete collected data) and provide timely access when consumers request to view their stored data profiles. Additionally, all brands must provide special protection for children’s data, including age verification and parent/guardian consent.","How does it affect American brands?","Whether you’re a hotel, airline or technology company, U.S. businesses that want to continue tracking online data for European consumers really have no choice but to comply. Not adhering to a strict set of regulations set forth by the GDPR runs the risk of up to €20 million in fines or 4% of the company’s total global revenue.","To avoid these fines, U.S. companies are prepared to invest heavily in GDPR stipulations. A study by PwC concluded that 77% of executives at companies with over 500 employees plan to invest $1 million or more to ensure compliance. Unfortunately, another study by Solix Technologies shows that, as of December 2017, 22% of American companies surveyed are still unaware that they must comply. Worse yet, it is estimated that roughly half of all U.S. companies that should be compliant will not have taken the necessary protections by the May 25 deadline.","What can a business do to prepare?","Besides bringing on a data protection officer, GDPR calls on businesses to do a thorough audit of their internal data collection procedures. The best way to do this is to contract with a credible cybersecurity firm with significant experience in GDPR compliance. They can help you not only identify recommended areas of improvement but guide you through the implementation process.","Another important component of GDPR preparation is internal company communication. Throughout the compliance process, your IT staff should be in close collaboration with each department of the company to ensure everyone understands GDPR regulations and how they impact company policy.","Last but not least, don’t forget to update your privacy policy to reflect any changes implemented for GDPR compliance. This will not only cover your bases with client opt-in controls but also prepare your company for the inevitable GDPR assessments on tap in coming months and years.","While the repercussions of GDPR are clear when it comes to noncompliance fines, penalties and sanctions, companies will also need to consider its effect on branded marketing strategy. GDPR won’t completely eliminate American companies’ ability to run data-driven campaigns — like retargeting and acquisition ads — in Europe, but it will certainly complicate things. Much like the compliance process itself, the key with ad campaigns will be to provide crystal-clear communication about privacy policies, allow users to gain full control of their data information and, ultimately, become more creative in marketing and advertising strategy.","The reality is failure to properly address GDPR can result in the ultimate double whammy: fines gained and marketing revenue lost."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

These companies have gotten to big to fail, have their fingers in to many pots and hold way to much influence. At a certain point a company stops being a corporation and starts being a quasi-institution.","This recalls to me some of the same elements Michel Foucault uses in his characterization of the Panopticon: The power to make people behave in certain ways not because they are being forced to do so, not because they are being watched all the time, but because they believe that they are being watched, and act accordingly. Social Media, then (or as I also heard, YouTwitFace) is our current society's Panopticon.","It also matches up pretty neatly with the Prof. Quentin Skinner lecture that was posted here about a month ago regarding the history of the word \"liberty\" and the conceptualization of privacy as a fundamental component of liberty. Similar ideas are touched on in the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in the 1960s and 70s when it was considering whether or not a constitutional right to privacy existed in the \"penumbra\" of the enumerated rights.","If we accept that \"freedom from coercive interference\" is something that ought to be protected, how far should that extend? \"Coercive interference\" would certainly cover any form of advertising, data-driven or otherwise, and I'd say would also apply to forms of propaganda such as those perpetuated by the public and private public relations industries. It's virtually limitless when you think about all the ways that someone or some thing is trying to \"coerce\" you every day. Personally, I don't think that \"freedom from coercive interference\" is something that could be consistently defended in a coherent way.","I too have realized this problem with google. If you Google a topic or a social issue, it will almost assuredly give you search results that support a view that Google wants, usually a democratic point of view.","I find it terribly ironic that between Clinton/Trump campaigns they spent almost TWO BILLLION dollars (Clinton ~1.2B / Trump ~650MM) and we're worried about Facebook.","I am more concerned about the horrific amounts of money spent and the ugly, dishonorable campaigns the news organizations were endlessly fighting over like a pack of wild dogs because they not only got a lot of that money, but made even more when they helped keep the tempo of the fights because it was advertising revenue gold between \"expert\" panels of highly paid, blowhard scumbags arguing over meaningless bone and sinew* because it meant that they would be invited back for more ratings glory.","TWO BILLION dollars and this is what we get? Seriously.","I am not worried about Facebook. I am worried about how people consume the information. I used to think we were smarter than that. Obviously not.","Coercion /koʊˈɜːrʃən/ is the practice of forcing another party to act in an involuntary manner by use of threats or force.[1] It involves a set of various types of forceful actions that violate the free will of an individual to induce a desired response. (Wikipedia). The only thing you described is sheep. Don't be one.","I deleted my facebook after highschool or at least deleted it from my memory all social media is cancer everyone should delete that shit. The entire internet is toxic look at any comment section on any platform. Social media has been proven to cause depression, anxiety, sleep problems, eating issues, and increased suicide risk. Everyone should fuck over our internet overlords. We have all the power imagine everyone just stopped going to facebook. Everyone cries they stole our info and sold it argg so angry quoted right off facebook hello i don't get it. Consumers have all the power in the world yet we let companies rule our lives. why just ignore them watch them go bankrupt.","I fail to see the difference between Facebook and Fox News/CNN. If you choose to watch news that are clearly politically biased, that’s your choice/fault. You already live in a bubble by your own choice.","Facebook showing you only news that you are likely to already agree with is no different. It just makes it more convenient. People truly affected by this would have scrolled past news they disagree with anyway and regarded them as fake/inaccurate.","And to an extent, that’s not too different from what google does. Where the top results are what you are likely to click on, based on the profile google has built with your data.","The only way around this is to actively seek news from all over and using tools that don’t track your data.","The problem, in my view, is that Facebook is now something more sinister than in the beginning. Everyone originally joined Facebook as a way of communicating with friends. Remember back in the day when it was just status updates from your friends*? Then your parents started joining and your grandparents. Then we could post websites and videos (and so did your racist uncle). Then there was money to be made by posting that crap. Then there’s political advantage for posting lies.","Then we'd also be free from the stuff commercials pay for. I don't know about you, but a lot of people would be upset if YouTube, Google, and Facebook were subscription services that had to be paid for upfront.","Maybe the difference, and I'm just spitballing here, is that any old traditional advertising tries to manipulate us by known rather low-grade common denominators. Which is at best abstract and removed from the individual. But with more and more data and especially data that is gathered without consent (well, arguably naive, not very informed consent) to target specific individuals, the equation changes? Exacerbated perhaps by the surprise (again naive) that \"advances\" in advertising aren't limited to the commerical sphere.","The value of personal information now that advertising has evolved with technology is here to stay. The \"Big Brother\" the author warns of is really just anyone seeking profit. People have volunteered their \"freedom\" (I disagree with the term's use in the title and article) in exchange for not having to pay for a service that seems nearly vital to them.","Social media is not going anywhere, no matter how many scandals there are or litigation. In the 24 hour news cycle people tend to have the attention span of a goldfish, and frankly it's difficult not to.","The big question is going to be what the evolved business model for social networking is going to look like. Facebook and Google can't exist in their current form/capacity without targeted ads unless users want to pay for the service directly. Humans love free shit, especially if they can ignore it's actual cost 99% of the time, then be outraged at the 1% of the time a scandal hits the news.","This article seems to dig very deep despite a very visible issue. Massive social media platforms are very expensive. Even actual successes like Twitter are for the most part unprofitable (I believe something like >95% of their quarterly reports are losses). Consumers (who are currently products) need to decide if they will pay for these services as they are by trading their information for use, or if they will pay directly via some sort of a subscription model.","The option to surrender personal information in an almost subconscious manner is completely voluntary. I fail to agree that it compromises our freedom both in the definition of freedom but more-so in the public's willingness to give up this information in exchange for use of the platform. The option to simply not use it, or at the least only use it for basic things is completely feasible.","When treating adults as adults, with the chance to opt-out with no cost at any point in time ever, is considered \"unconscionable\", I feel like even discussing ethics is moot. Ethics afterall is based on decisions. If people are too stupid to make their own decisions ethics boils down to who should be our dictator.","You're right about Facebook not being obligatory. Everyone is obviously at liberty to stop using it at any time.","That said, the fact that Facebook is optional does not suddenly mean it is permissible for them to put anything they want into their TOS. It would be unconscionable for them to e.g. require every user to give them rights to sell their likeness to be used as involuntary pornography. It would be unconscionable for Facebook to sell or share information about political exiles with the death squads that hunt them. Despite the fact that Facebook is a trivial diversion, there are still legal and moral limits to the kinds of relationships that Facebook can even attempt to engage in with its users. This is a fact.","Americans like to make a real fetish out of the sanctity of the contract, as though nobody has ever had a gun held to their head, as though coercion and duress are fictions.","As a facebook user, I don't mind. Mark Z. If you are reading this, I really honestly don't mind you taking that information. It's valuable to you but to me it's not valuable so please don't sweat it. This whole Facebook drama will blow over.","Knowing I am constantly surveilled by government and industry is oppressive and stifling. I wanted to buy a pressure cooker online right after the Boston marathon bombing. I waited for weeks in hopes to not attract anyone who might think I was going to be a copycat bomber. I just purchased online materials to make fertilizer wondering if I would be questioned as to my intention for these items. I expressed my opinion on the politics sub with a metaphor the moderators could not comprehend and was banned due to their ignorance. I came of age long before social media and felt much more free when it was only financial and legal oppression I suffered under. Now I feel like I live in an absolute police state. Knowing I am spied on all the time makes me feel like I am going to be fleeced, chastised or punished at any moment. I am convinced this has deeply negative effects on social interaction, commerce and politics. This constant pressure and annoyance is making people crack and disengage. A perfect vehicle for absolute corruption for those in power. I hope the population gets wise before ignorance is prevalent.","Exactly, everything on my Facebook (and all social media for that matter) advised that Trump was a racist monster I vote against. I’m an extreme conservative so it should follow that Facebook only shows me what I agree with, but I rarely saw news praising conservative movements, and the ones I did find were rubbish garbage.","I agree. They should be required to make a friendly videos with nice music about what they do with our information like they do when they want to teach you about a new site feature. Like a \"this is how it works, how we make our money\" series.","What reason does facebook have to be this scrupulous provider of social interaction that you expect it to be? People willingly give their data to a company. Nobody is required to do this in any form. I dont understand where is the \"abuse\". Its like writing down your phone number in public toilets and then being outraged about weirdos calling you at night.","I agree with you Travis, I do not understand why people cannot wrap their minds around the fact Facebook is nothing more than a company with shareholders. Perhaps someone could explain why people believe it's some sort of core human endeavor ment to benefit the whole of society by making it easy to share family photos.","You can't say that our internet isn't under attack by companies wanting to sell our data for big bucks, and the recent cloud law that was passed allows the U.S. Government (and other countries) to use all of it while providing the companies with gag orders about the data being used, completely with no oversight.","All you're saying is that it's our own fault for being scammed because no one bothered to read \"the small print\" (which is only included to keep their ass from being sued), and that's straight victim-blaming.","The FTC is talking about fining Facebook $60k per each of fifty million infractions. Facebook has a lot of money, but it doesn't have that much money, especially after it's shares took a twenty percent hit. And then the EU is rolling out a new social media policy in the next couple months with draconian penalties. Now is not a good time for Zuckerberg to go on vacation. If he does, there might not be a Facebook when he gets back.","Which EU policy are you talking about? Yeah FTC is talking about but lets wait and see. Pretty sure they won't shoot at an US company that important because of the data they have. I bet there won't be any serious consequences in the USA.

Regulators in the U.S. and U.K. have criticized the company for allowing Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that helped the Trump campaign, to access data on users without their express permission and hold that data for years despite saying that it had destroyed those records.","The stock plunged 6.8% in midday trading Monday. That would be the biggest one-day percentage decline since it tumbled 6.9% on march 26, 2014. The price decline of $12.53 would be the biggest since Facebook went public in May 2012.","Many analysts acknowledged that the latest episode represents a public relations and regulatory risk to Facebook, though they were divided on the company’s ability to weather such challenges.","“It appears that data access by the original app developer was properly permissioned (i.e., this was not a ‘breach’ per se) and we note that Facebook has since upgraded its user privacy functionality and app review process to prevent similar abuse,” wrote Wells Fargo analysts led by Peter Stabler. “Nonetheless, this episode appears likely to create another and potentially more serious public relations ‘black eye’ for the company and could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny.”","GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives commented that this new wave of scrutiny could prompt Facebook to make additional tweaks to its news feed and broader platform. “It’s clear with more ‘heat in the kitchen from the Beltway’ that further modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” he wrote.","Facebook announced at the start of the year that it would begin to prioritize content from friends and family members over content from publishers, and the company said on its latest earnings call that changes intended to de-emphasize viral videos had resulted in users spending 50 million fewer hours per day on the platform. Facebook has been able to overcome such issues so far, posting strong growth despite significant increases in ad prices.","Ives believes that Facebook “can keep regulators at bay” through investments in security, screening, and artificial intelligence but thinks that the next few weeks will require Facebook to “hand hold and assure its users and regulators around tighter content standards and platform security.” Ives rates Facebook stock “highly attractive” and has a $225 price target.","Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser, one of just two analysts with a sell rating on the stock, said he does not expect the latest revelations to pose a near-term risk for Facebook.","“This episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook, although the company’s business won’t likely be meaningfully impacted for now because we don’t think advertisers will suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform,” Wieser wrote. The company may face “enhanced” risk now, from a regulatory perspective and in terms of what it allows third-parties to measure, according to Wieser. He thinks advertisers may grow frustrated if Facebook begins restricting various types of measurements.","Stifel analyst Scott Devitt said Facebook hasn’t moved swiftly enough to address security concerns about its platform and that the company has been too quick to brush off concerns from critics. He believes the changes Facebook needs to make to restore user trust and tackle these security issues could “ultimately lead to lower engagement and negative monetization implications.” Devitt rates the stock at hold with a $195 target.","Intraday Data provided by SIX Financial Information and subject to terms of use.

Perhaps.","Here’s a segment from a great post by Doc Searls:","Let’s start with Facebook’s Surveillance Machine, by Zeynep Tufekci in last Monday’s New York Times. Among other things (all correct), Zeynep explains that “Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please.” Irony Alert: the same is true for the Times, along with every other publication that lives off adtech: tracking-based advertising. These pubs don’t just open the kimonos of their readers. They bring people’s bare digital necks bared to vampires ravenous for the blood of personal data, all for the purpose of “interest-based” advertising.","I have no problem admitting that I’m a fanboy of Doc Searls.

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn't authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook's unusual public explanation of the move wasn't clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company. For the \"avoidance of doubt,\" the spokesman said, none of Kogan's data was used in Cambridge Analytica's 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign.","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign.

It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","(Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”)","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","\"I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the \"maximum exposure\" could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more - likely in the tens of millions - because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user's list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend's demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","\"They say 'trust us,' but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement.","Rep. Adam Schiff, Calif., the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","\"I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,\" Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. \"There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms.\"","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union's justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","\"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,\" Collins said Sunday. \"It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.\"","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","\"We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,\" Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, said in the statement. \"That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.\"","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a \"breach\" of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook's request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor's role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook's privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica's app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ecree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, \"We've heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.\" That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend's data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday, \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, \"bespeaks the same recklessness with its users' data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.\"","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","\"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,\" Rich said. \"They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.\"","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users' sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users' friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users' explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers' consent before \"enacting changes that override their privacy practices,\" the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","\"This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can't do the job.\"","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., also criticized Facebook on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"","\"Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they're above the rules that apply to everybody else,\" Rubio said."],"isopubdate":""}

Nevada holds a special place in Obama-wonk lore as the place where his monthslong strategy of defeating Hillary Clinton by slowly and surely amassing delegates emerged. But the operatives were not there in March for any political reason. They were there to make money — specifically to land what they hoped would be the first corporate client for their new advertising business, Analytics Media Group (A.M.G.). Its bland name obscures its relatively grand promise: to deliver to commercial advertisers some of the Obama campaign’s secret, technologically advanced formulas for reaching voters.","The potential client was Caesars. The casino chain was looking for ways to induce semiregular visitors to show up more routinely at its other casinos around the country and to keep regulars from defecting to new competitors. A.M.G. was making the pitch that keeping gamblers loyal to Caesars was not all that different from keeping onetime Obama voters from straying to Mitt Romney. It was all a matter of figuring out how to get their message in front of the right customers at the right time. It was not lost on the Obama strategists that the “change” they were talking about was not the kind “you can believe in” but rather the kind you can put in a slot machine. “I kind of felt like the Devil’s advocate,” Chauncey McLean, 31, the Democratic Party’s director of media tracking during the campaign and now A.M.G.’s chief operating officer, wryly told me.","A.M.G. was founded in late December by a splinter group of longtime Obama advisers: Larry Grisolano, who oversaw how the campaign spent its advertising dollars; Grisolano’s direct-mail partners Terry Walsh and Pete Giangreco; Jeff Link, a seasoned Iowa veteran who was an outside adviser in 2012; and Erik Smith, an advertising consultant for the 2012 campaign, whose work running one of the biggest 2004 pro-Kerry outside groups gave him an inside track with party donors from the corporate world.","McLean was their first hire. During the campaign he proved himself to be particularly deft at translating between the old hands of the political world, who talk about “message” and “narrative,” and the quants in their 20s, who speak of “code” and “algorithms.”","McLean was so moved by Obama’s 2004 convention speech — the one that called for an end to a red-state America and a blue-state America — that when Obama decided to run in 2008, he took a leave from law school and joined the campaign. He had just spent the last 18 months of the 2012 presidential race bouncing between a couch in Washington and a small, shared apartment in Chicago where a colleague slept in the dining room. So he was experiencing considerable culture shock in the high life of Vegas.","Arriving at Caesars Palace after a first-class flight (only the second of his life), he was shown to his room. “I open the door and there’s just this huge, like, double, wall-to-wall window with a view of the strip and a huge king bed,” he said. Over room service, he met with his deputy, Chris Frommann, now 26, and made some last-minute revisions to their proposal. McLean took an iPhone picture of his kung pao chicken and sent it to his wife back in Brooklyn, “to show her that I’d made it,” he joked.","The next morning McLean, Frommann, Grisolano, Smith and a couple of others were escorted through a maze of doors that led them to the casino’s marble-and-glass executive offices, where their meeting went well enough that they scheduled another, to discuss a deal. Later that night they celebrated with a red-meat-and-red-wine dinner at Old Homestead, Caesars’ upscale steakhouse.","Recalling that Vegas trip while sitting at a MacBook Pro-dotted coffee shop in Brooklyn in March, McLean treated his shift from selling Obama to selling Caesars as a small discomfort that was necessary if he wanted to keep working on the technological advancements he and his colleagues developed on the campaign. In a nonpresidential year, no political effort would have the money to finance what he described as the “huge R.& D. project” that the Obama campaign effectively became. The resources for that kind of project could now be found only in corporate America. If companies with big budgets wanted members of Obama’s team to do for them whatever it was that they did for the president, McLean couldn’t see why they shouldn’t answer the call.","Political marketing has usually lagged behind commercial marketing. Companies that spend billions of dollars a year developing ways to make many more billions of dollars a year tend to have little to learn from presidential campaigns, which are generally start-ups aimed at a one-day sale. But the (re)selling of the president, 2012, was an entirely different matter. The campaign recruited the best young minds in the booming fields of analytics and behavioral science and placed them in a room they called “the cave” for up to 16 hours a day over the course of roughly 16 months. After the election, when the technology wizards finally came out, they had not only helped produce a victory that defied a couple of historical predictors; they also developed a host of highly effective marketing techniques that were either entirely new or had never been tried on such a grand scale.","Grisolano and McLean and the others were part of a singular breakthrough in the field of television-ad buying, where about 50 percent of the campaign’s budget was spent, or more than $400 million. Previous campaigns would make decisions about how to direct their television-advertising budgets largely based on hunches and deductions about what channels the voters they wanted to reach were watching. Their choices were informed by the broad viewership ratings of Nielsen and other survey data, which typically led to buying relatively expensive ads during evening-news and prime-time viewing hours. The 2012 campaign took advantage of advanced set-top-box monitoring technology to figure out what shows the voters they wanted to reach were watching and when, resulting in a smarter and cheaper — if potentially more invasive — way to beam commercials into their homes. The system gave Obama a significant advantage over Mitt Romney, according to Democrats and many Republicans (at least those who were not on Romney’s media team). Now A.M.G.’s founders say the company is at the forefront of a move to turn upside down the way the $60-billion-a-year television-ad market has functioned since its start. And they hope to get very rich in the process.","That is essentially the pitch Grisolano began making just before Christmas to the tech whizzes he needed to hire to rebuild the system they used during the campaign. He also offered profit sharing and salaries often commensurate with those being offered by Facebook or Google, who were also recruiting from the Obama campaign.","“You’re sort of involved in this cutting edge of something and see this whole thing on the horizon changing,” Grisolano recounted telling them. “I think that’s exciting.”","McLean, for one, was primed to hear his message. When the election was won last fall, he asked Jim Messina, Obama’s innovative campaign manager — and ardent tech advocate — what he should do with his life. As McLean tells it, and Messina affirms, Messina said, “I’d either go out into the country and run a campaign or I’d go make a load of money.”","A couple of weeks before Election Day, over drinks at the Pump Room in Chicago’s Gold Coast, a safe distance away from the re-election headquarters and its press minders, Grisolano and Erik Smith first let on that there was far more happening in the Chicago campaign office than any of us covering it truly understood. Grisolano told me that the campaign literally knew every single wavering voter in the country that it needed to persuade to vote for Obama, by name, address, race, sex and income. What’s more, he hinted, the campaign had figured out how to get its television advertisements in front of them with a previously inconceivable level of knowledge and accuracy.","Grisolano, a gruff and stocky Iowan, spent years in the shadow of his mentor, Obama’s founding strategist, David Axelrod, happily so, but he now seemed eager for his own recognition. There was also no mistaking that he believed he had figured something out that would be worth a lot of money after the election. He wouldn’t say more, at least not then. But after the election, in February, he began to describe his new business venture to me in detail.","To understand how it works, you must first understand the vast technological engine that powered the campaign but remained largely out of view of the public and the press. Messina, the campaign manager, often boasted about how the Obama 2012 effort would be “the most data-driven campaign ever.” But what that truly meant — the extent to which the campaign used the newest tech tools to look into people’s lives and the sheer amount of personal data its vast servers were crunching — remained largely shrouded. The secrecy around the operation was partly because the president’s strategists wanted to maintain their competitive edge. But it was also no doubt because they worried that practices like “data mining” and “analytics” could make voters uncomfortable.","Using data wasn’t new for the Obama strategists. The 2008 campaign developed the most sophisticated system to date to identify tens of millions of voters and place them into useful categories: those most likely to vote Republican, who would be ignored; those supporting Obama — and how likely they were to vote. That system — based on a complicated scoring method that relied on the processing of reams of data — was first devised by an outside consultant, Ken Strasma. But it was partly managed inside the campaign by an economics forecaster, Dan Wagner, who, at 24, helped perfect it for the campaign’s use. Wagner, who was recruited by A.M.G. but decided to start his own venture instead, seems to exist in two realms. One is digital, where he operates like a Dungeons and Dragons dungeon master, trying to shape the rules to the reality he is creating (“I was a Level 14 wizard or something,” he jokes of the fantasy role-playing game). The other is corporeal, where he is self-deprecating about things like his romantic life. (“Hey, I do ‘Big Data,’ ” he says.) His work on the 2008 campaign has been portrayed in a book, “The Victory Lab,” by Sasha Issenberg. “Here’s where I am in the ‘Victory Lab’ — blah, blah, blah,” he said dryly while turning to his chapter in the copy I was carrying when we met for breakfast at the Ace Hotel in Manhattan one day in May.","Wagner dismisses the notion of “romantic war rooms” operating on political gut instinct as outdated and misguided. His is a hard-data system that rejects anything that is not definitively quantifiable. In the Bush era, strategists boasted about how they could predict voter behavior based upon car and sport preferences, a well-publicized bit of political magic that captured the imaginations of politicians and journalists alike. Wagner’s approach, part of a broader move in politics, cut all of that out; why engage in such divination when you have the time and money to just call voters and ask them about their leanings directly? “We’re trying to predict political preference; we’re not trying to predict whether you buy a car,” Wagner says dismissively.","Photo","Left to right: Gaurav Shirole, Chris Frommann, Chauncey McLean, Will St. Clair.Credit\nAndrew Hetherington for The New York Times","The campaign couldn’t call the more than 150 million registered voters, obviously. But they could call enough of them in swing states (up to 11,000 a night) to figure out how they — and other people who lived near them, looked like them and earned like them — were likely to vote with an increasing degree of accuracy. In 2008, Wagner and his small team combined information from those calls with any other data they could find — census data, state voter lists and the like — and fed it into algorithms that produced support scores. One ranked how likely swing-state voters were to support Obama on a scale of 0 to 100, and another ranked how likely they were to show up at voting booths. Those scores helped the campaign direct resources toward the right voters, and Obama beat John McCain by 7 percentage points.","But even before the president took office, as the economy was in meltdown, his strategists, looking ahead four years, assumed that his re-election would not be easy. Wagner was assigned to the Democratic National Committee headquarters, where he set out to develop a far more sophisticated version of his analytics system, using bigger computer servers, better data on the nation’s voting-age population and more precise algorithms.","If there was any doubt about the system, it was dispelled after the 2010 special election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Edward M. Kennedy’s death. For much of the campaign, pollsters for the Democratic candidate, Martha Coakley, showed her ahead. Wagner and his group had their own numbers indicating that Coakley’s support was soft and dropping. His warnings went up the chain to the president, but some strategists dismissed him as if he were a “ ‘dumb kid,’ ” Wagner told me.","After Coakley lost and Wagner’s methods were validated, the Democratic Party poured money into Wagner’s department, which grew from 2 people to 15. Later that year, Wagner’s team developed the prototype for what Messina says he considers “an evolutionary jump”: a newly robust and reliable “persuasion score” that identified how easily individual undecided voters could be persuaded to vote for or against the Democrat in a race, based on how likely they were to show shifts in their preferences in telephone interviews conducted over time.","When Messina started up the Obama re-election campaign in 2011, he gave Wagner the go-ahead to nearly quadruple his team, which was moved to the cavernous office space at the Prudential Center in Chicago. This immediately made his analytics department one of the biggest of its kind in the country.","Obama supported the idea, aides said. But he warned in one early meeting against getting too deep into the data and “slicing the salami too thin,” as his communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, put it to me.","Soon after the office opened, Wagner’s group moved into a separate, windowless room, the cave. Messina said he wanted them to lose all sense of time and to focus. Wagner also cited the secret nature of the work. I once unknowingly wandered near the cave, looking for a bathroom, and a young press aide chased me down and escorted me away. (Because it was also near the kitchen, at the time I thought the aide was concerned I might try to force a metaphor out of an exposed piece of rotting fruit.)","“Anybody who had a computer and a basement as a kid saw the cave as a real opportunity,” Wagner told me. It was packed with about 40 desks, a number that was determined through a contest Wagner held among his staff to figure out how to “best utilize the floor plan.” The result came from “the best combination of square footage per person, subject to constraints: You couldn’t move your arms more than six inches without hitting somebody,” he said. On the back of the door his team would affix pieces of paper with snippets of conversation they heard from people who walked by: “Those people are weird, don’t go in there” or “That’s the secret sauce.” Across one wall there was a large printout of the surface of Mars, a mocking reference to a column in The Wall Street Journal in which Peggy Noonan described a job posting of Wagner’s as “politics as done by Martians.”","In fact, through his postings, Wagner assembled a team that included a biophysicist, who worked at the Stem Cell Initiative at Harvard and three professional poker players. The cave dwellers would take breaks at the Ping-Pong table out in the main offices with their peers; Gaurav Shirole, a 23-year-old data analyst and graduate of the business school at the University of California, Berkeley, who also joined A.M.G., became so good that when the president visited the campaign office during the summer, the staff volunteered Shirole to compete against Obama. (Shirole won, but got in trouble with his mother when she saw the photo of him playing in flip-flops and a T-shirt.)","Yet in truth, their task was daunting. Shortly after Messina opened the Chicago offices, Joel Benenson, the president’s national pollster, conducted a “benchmark” poll that had some sobering results. Roughly a fifth of Obama’s 2008 vote had shifted into the undecided column. “We knew we weren’t going to get all of them,” Benenson said. But the campaign needed to get back many millions of them. And it fell to Wagner’s team to figure out exactly who they were, to a man and to a woman, and then rank them according to a 0 to 10 persuasion score.","As the denizens of the cave were setting out to do that, the digital-analytics team, led by Rayid Ghani, a 35-year-old research scientist from Accenture Labs, developed an idea: Why not try sifting through self-described supporters’ Facebook pages in search of friends who might be on the campaign’s list of the most persuadable voters? Then the campaign could ask the self-identified supporters to bring their undecided friends along. The technique, as they saw it, could also get supporters to urge friends to register to vote, to vote early or to volunteer and donate.","Identifying persuadable friends became a significant undertaking. “We ended up building it from scratch because nothing like that existed,” Ghani told me. The computer code alone was thousands of lines, said Will St. Clair, 25, who helped write it and who also now works with McLean at A.M.G.","The campaign didn’t go into much detail, at the time, about exactly how it used Facebook. But St. Clair put it in fairly stark terms when I talked to him at A.M.G.’s temporary offices in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in April. They started with a list that grew to a million people who had signed into the campaign Web site through Facebook. When people opted to do so, they were met with a prompt asking to grant the campaign permission to scan their Facebook friends lists, their photos and other personal information. In another prompt, the campaign asked for access to the users’ Facebook news feeds, which 25 percent declined, St. Clair said.","Once permission was granted, the campaign had access to millions of names and faces they could match against their lists of persuadable voters, potential donors, unregistered voters and so on. “It would take us 5 to 10 seconds to get a friends list and match it against the voter list,” St. Clair said. They found matches about 50 percent of the time, he said. But the campaign’s ultimate goal was to deputize the closest Obama-supporting friends of voters who were wavering in their affections for the president. “We would grab the top 50 you were most active with and then crawl their wall” to figure out who were most likely to be their real-life friends, not just casual Facebook acquaintances. St. Clair, a former high-school marching-band member who now wears a leather Diesel jacket, explained: “We asked to see photos but really we were looking for who were tagged in photos with you, which was a really great way to dredge up old college friends — and ex-girlfriends,” he said.","The campaign’s exhaustive use of Facebook triggered the site’s internal safeguards. “It was more like we blew through an alarm that their engineers hadn’t planned for or knew about,” said St. Clair, who had been working at a small firm in Chicago and joined the campaign at the suggestion of a friend. “They’d sigh and say, ‘You can do this as long as you stop doing it on Nov. 7.’ ” (Facebook officials say warning bells go off when the site sees large amounts of unusual activity, but in each case the company was satisfied the campaign was not violating its privacy and data standards.)","By March 2012, Wagner’s team had a workable list of what it deemed to be the most persuadable voters — in total, roughly 15 million of them in the swing states. Messina ordered the campaign to direct a majority of its efforts toward winning them back, one by one if necessary. They could reach many through their Facebook friends and others through more conventional means like e-mail and knocking on doors. But how could the Obama campaign be as targeted and tech-savvy on TV?","The Internet, and specifically social media, may have fundamentally changed politics, but there is still nothing with the power to enrage or inspire like a well-produced television ad (see “47 percent, Romney”). This is in part because of the evocative nature of video, which can be transmitted over the Internet as well. But it’s also because that imagery is typically put in front of people when they are at their most receptive, zoning out on the couch, relaxing, their defenses down.","TV advertising has also historically been the most expensive and least efficient way to reach voters. Commercial TV time is still valued and sold in pretty much the same way as it was when people gathered every night to watch Walter Cronkite. Most advertising is based on audience ratings kept by Nielsen Media Research, which derives its information from a national survey of 22,000 households and smaller surveys in local markets, selected to perfectly represent the American television-viewing population, Nielsen says. Through “people meters” that monitor what specific members of these households are watching in real time and, in some cases, written diaries of its participating families, Nielsen does a reasonably good job of telling advertisers which demographic groups are watching which shows. Nielsen’s ratings categories are still dominated by the broad audience segment known as “adults 18 to 49,” but they can also include smaller groups like “women 18-plus” and “Hispanics.” If Revlon wants to sell its newest shade of lipstick, for example, it knows it can reach lots of women through a show like “Grey’s Anatomy.” If Miller Lite wants to get its shiny blue cans in front of young men in their beer-drinking prime, it knows it can do so through spots on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”","Political campaigns have typically shown most of their ads during news programs, where they can reach older viewers who are engaged in the topics of the day and, it stands to reason, are most likely to vote. If a pollster identified other broad groups that a candidate wanted to reach, like women or young men, then the campaign could venture out into other shows. Traditionally, “these are the tools that you have,” Grisolano told me one day at his office in Chicago, the L train screeching along the rails outside. “You have programming that overdelivers or underdelivers in broad, sweeping groups.”","The better that campaigns — and all major marketers — have become at identifying precisely whom they want to talk to, the more inefficient the old model can seem. For instance, a campaign may need to win over those 5 percent of independent, female, likely voters who are still undecided, but there is no separate ratings category for them, no precise way to know which shows they are watching. It’s very likely a campaign can speak to some of them through commercials on “Grey’s Anatomy,” but by buying time there, the campaign is spending a lot of money on an audience that is mostly made up of people the candidate actually does not need to speak to.","The 2012 Obama campaign knew it had to be especially efficient in buying television time because it expected to be outspent by the combined forces of the Romney campaign and super PACs, including the American Crossroads organization, co-founded by Karl Rove.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","“If we had to withstand being outspent — and nobody wanted to withstand it — but if we had to, we could tolerate being outspent with the people who have basically already made up their mind for us or the people who made up their mind against us,” Grisolano said. “But we were going to make sure that we put the full power of our buy with the people who were swing voters, who were on the edge. So, my task became, how do you create the tools you need to make that a reality?”","Grisolano was going to have one thing at his disposal that no presidential adviser had before him: Wagner’s list of roughly 15 million persuadable voters. But he had no way of knowing if he would be able to reach them with any real precision on TV. He turned to Amy Gershkoff, a young political scientist he met a couple of years before who was making a name for herself grappling with just these sorts of challenges. Gershkoff was 30 years old, had a Ph.D. from Princeton and had developed software that was making political ad buying more efficient. Gershkoff was digging more deeply into the Nielsen data and matching it against information in party-voter lists to get a better read on what shows key voting blocs — not generic television audiences — were watching. She was finding that a campaign could reach many of them in greater concentrations and for less money on cable channels like Lifetime than on more expensive shows with bigger audiences like “The Office.”","Grisolano recommended that Messina speak with her, and Messina hired her to be director of media planning, reporting directly to him. Messina wanted Gershkoff to build a master program that would allow him, as the campaign manager, to decide how to spend the campaign’s advertising budget across all mediums — not just television, but the Internet, radio, print ads and the mail — at optimum cost using real-time polling data to measure how the ads were moving or not moving opinion. (A version of this project would be built by McLean, whom Gershkoff brought with her, and Frommann, his deputy.)","But it soon became clear that such a system could eliminate the role of Obama’s longtime television-ad-buying firm, GMMB, run by the senior Obama strategist Jim Margolis, which stood to potentially lose millions in buying commissions. Colleagues described Margolis as furious. He called it “dumbfounded.” Grisolano and Axelrod backed him up in his argument that any savings on commissions would be wiped out in the chaos of recreating a system that already existed (and forgoing the expertise and relationships that Margolis’s 30-person buying team had in the television world).","Messina relented, but said that GMMB would take guidance from Gershkoff’s department. As Gershkoff put it to me gingerly when we spoke in May: “Fundamentally I was brought in to create tools that would help Jim spend nine digits’ worth of the campaign’s budget. Any time you’re moving that kind of money around, people can be resistant to the idea.”","There were other turf battles. Gershkoff was given her own analytics department to analyze media, but Wagner believed all analytics should be handled uniformly through his department, several former campaign officials said. (He wouldn’t discuss it with me when I asked about it.) The two had differences in other areas as well. Gershkoff insisted that her staff members wear business attire; Wagner, who often wore flip-flops, had only one requirement of his staff in the cave: “You have to wear clothes.”","But Gershkoff had come upon a cache of data that all the strategists would come to appreciate. She had contracted with a relatively new firm called Rentrak that was competing with Nielsen and was buying up real-time, raw viewing data directly from cable and satellite companies that had nearly 20 million set-top boxes in eight million homes. When Gershkoff told Grisolano, he was thrilled. Rentrak’s huge new trove of data, he surmised, could help him find out with relative certainty what shows were being delivered to the homes of the roughly 15 million persuadable voters Wagner’s department had identified.","The concept for the “optimizer,” as it was known in the campaign, was born: a system that could determine with more precision than ever what swing voters were watching in the greatest concentrations and how to get commercials in front of them in the cheapest advertising time slots possible. But making that idea a reality was going to be very difficult. “My first idea was, O.K., I’ve got a list of people who I know are targets here,” Grisolano said. “I’ve got a list of viewers and what they watch over here. Just match them up and spit out what TV shows my targets are watching.” He acknowledged that “what I didn’t necessarily fully grasp in my enthusiastic naïveté was that the size and magnitude of these data sets are apparently extraordinary, and the engineering feat of doing what I wanted to do was a lot more complicated than I envisioned it.”","That task would not ultimately be overseen by Gershkoff. By the end of 2011, she left the campaign, her tenure cut short by a family emergency, she said. When she re-emerged that spring, it was as the director of global analytics at the public relations and advertising firm Burson-Marsteller.","Responsibility for building the optimizer was handed off to Wagner. “We took over in January and then had to build it from scratch, completely from scratch,” he said. Fortunately, there happened to be a rare expert in set-top-box data, named Carol Davidsen, working in the cave. Davidsen looks younger than her 37 years — “no kids,” she says — and she speaks in a rapid, elliptical manner, as if her thoughts are running too fast for her sentences to keep pace. Before joining the campaign, she had a successful career as a forward-thinking data engineer. But she had become fed up with corporate life by the time she received an unsolicited e-mail from Wagner’s analytics department, which recruited employees by searching the 2008 online-donor list for those who listed themselves as programmers. “I’m a huge supporter of Barack Obama,” she said a few weeks ago at Think Coffee in Greenwich Village. “But I also was kind of at a time in my life where I needed to be part of a perfect team, and I knew that was possible in a world where people weren’t worried about getting a raise or people weren’t worried about getting a promotion.”","Her previous employer, Navic Networks, was a very early pioneer in the field of set-top-box data collection. And she was one of the early programmers to figure out how to make a television, designed as a one-way path for sending programming into American homes, relay information back about what exactly a viewer was watching.","Davidsen determined that Rentrak could roughly do what Grisolano wanted it to do: produce data that could be checked against Wagner’s list of most-persuadable voters to find matches. Rentrak had access to the set-top boxes in the homes of thousands of the targeted voters in every competitive market of every swing state. (For instance, Rentrak had 100,000 people in its Denver sample, some 20,000 of whom were on the Obama list; Nielsen had a total of 600 people in Denver.)","But there was the potentially politically explosive matter of privacy. Unlike Facebook, where users were at least giving the campaign explicit permission to collect personal data even if they had not read the fine print, television watchers were making no such agreement. To address this, the campaign and Rentrak hired a third party to “anonymize” the data so that they would only know that the information was coming from a set-top box of somebody on the persuadable list; identifying information would be stripped away.","The optimizer software would then comb advertising price and viewership data to figure out the top-rated time slots among those on the Obama persuadable list — which could vary from market to market — and then rank them based on which produced the highest concentration of the Obama swing voters at the best rates. The results were striking. The campaign determined that two of the top shows to buy were 1 a.m. repeats of “The Insider” and afternoon episodes of “Judge Joe Brown” — shows that were far cheaper than the evening news or anything being shown on the networks in prime time. “When you’re talking about ‘The Insider,’ that might be shift workers in a state like Ohio, folks who are working class and aren’t getting home until midnight,” said Daniel Jester, the head GMMB buyer, who was aggressively locking in low rates early. “The person watching ‘Judge Joe Brown’ in the afternoon also may be the same viewer watching ‘The Insider’ at 1 a.m.”","The Romney campaign was not pursuing these same voters the same way. If they had been, Davidsen told me, the market would have become competitive, prices would have spiked and the system would have lost some of its advantage. As far as the Obama team was concerned, the optimizer helped it do what most strategists deemed impossible in a campaign between two well-financed opponents — talk to undecided voters through television advertisements on shows on which the opposition was not running a countermessage.","By Election Day, the Obama campaign had done far more to utilize cable and to run ads at odd times of day — who watches “Area 51” on Syfy at 2:30 a.m.? — than Romney had. In all, Obama ran nearly twice as many cable ads as Romney did, 588,006, on more than twice as many channels, 100, according to analysis by NCC Media, which helped both campaigns place spots.","It is not that the Romney campaign was unaware such technology could be developed. Rentrak, a nonpartisan vendor, reached out to offer its services in the spring of 2012 but found no takers. The former Bush strategist Sara Fagen worked with the Romney consulting firm TargetPoint to develop a competing optimizing service, but, she said, the media team “chose not to use it.” (She is now working with some TargetPoint colleagues to develop one for a new company they are forming, Deep Root Analytics.)","Stuart Stevens, Romney’s chief strategist, said the campaign used plenty of data to inform its television buying. But as far as he was concerned, Fagen was one of many offering some new service. The Romney campaign, he said, had a different mission than Obama’s. “We still were trying to inform likely voters who Mitt Romney was,” he said, “and until you get those voters, you’re insane to go off and say, ‘We’re going to try to win this with left-handed Lithuanians.’ ”","In the end, an analysis by the Republican ad-buying firm National Media found that Obama paid roughly 35 percent less per broadcast commercial than Romney did. Kantar Media CMAG, an ad-monitoring firm, showed that Obama and his supporting super PAC got nearly 40,000 more spots on the air than Romney and his super PACs did despite spending roughly $90 million less.","The day after Obama won 51 percent of the vote, he visited his Chicago staff, including those on the analytics team. Davidsen said Obama hugged her and signed a favorite piece of cave paraphernalia, a replica of a narwhal tusk. “An honor,” she said.","When the campaign ended, Obama’s team of tech experts did not exactly knock down the door of the White House personnel office looking to put their newfound tools into the service of the new presidential agenda. They were heading East and West — to Silicon Valley, Wall Street and, in the case of A.M.G., Las Vegas — in search of venture capital and clients.","There is, of course, a tradition of political operatives leaving presidential campaigns to cash in on the corporate side. This has often been to join the public-policy campaigns of a given industry or company between political bouts, or perhaps to help with some brand and image management.","But there is just as much of a tradition in Democratic politics, especially among the young, to keep the fight alive after a campaign’s end. The young staff members of the McGovern campaign left that particularly demoralizing endeavor to re-engage with their causes and their party; the Web-pioneering Deaniacs went on to feed the ranks of MoveOn and the 2008 Obama campaign.","The Obama political movement had tended to hold itself apart from the corporate world, its members galvanized by what they saw as an opportunity to change the country. But after Election Day in November, huge political success met financial opportunity. The people in their 20s and 30s from the Obama tech team had seen others just like them get incredibly rich on innovations (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) that were as transformational as anything they could hope to achieve in government. Now they started to think about what innovations they could bring to the market.","A.M.G. may be the most baldly commercial of the new crop of companies coming out of the cave, but they are all trying to translate what they learned there into future success. A few weeks ago, Wagner announced he was starting a new firm called Civis Analytics with an investment from Eric Schmidt, the Google executive chairman, who was a technology adviser during the campaign. As Wagner described it to me, he would use analytics to help nonprofit and for-profit companies reach out to segments of the population they were struggling to connect with. One of his first clients is the College Board, which runs the national SAT test. Civis will identify “kids who are low-income, high-achieving but not meeting their college potential.” The “commercial applicability is wide,” he said, so the company will not be averse to working with big, for-profit companies of all kinds.","Carol Davidsen was also recruited by A.M.G., but she decided to take the lessons of the Obama campaign in a different direction. If anything, her approach is almost anticorporate, even though she said she was not against getting rich if she could. Her company, called Cir.cl, which she founded with a campaign programmer, Joshua Thayer, endeavors to find people with complementary interests who may have reason to do business with each other, like parents with baby equipment to dispose of and parents-to-be in the market for that equipment. She calls it “recommerce.”","“I have a lot of friends with kids,” she said one recent Friday at her new office, a bouncy-ball and Mac-strewn onetime closet space in an industrial building in Downtown Brooklyn. “There’s this little plastic play house. Does every single one of those need to go into a garbage dump? Why did we give up on doing business with each other? Why is it always to big corporations? It doesn’t have to be.” Explaining her choice to me, she said, “I don’t want to spend my time optimizing for Coke.”","When I talked to Chauncey McLean in Brooklyn in April, he walked me through how the campaign’s technological achievements could translate into services provided to private businesses, like Caesars. The casino had gobs of data on its customers. “We have a giant list of people, and we need to make a model of likely customers,” he said. A.M.G. would break them down along a range of Caesars Scores, à la Wagner’s persuadable scores. Then A.M.G. could work through it and direct advertising toward those whose visits had fallen off: find what they watch via Rentrak in the greatest concentrations and then ply them with TV advertising.","Over several meetings with McLean and his young A.M.G. staff members, I asked them to talk about the switch in mission from getting Obama elected to helping Fortune 500 companies sell stuff. Will St. Clair, who helped write the campaign’s Facebook program, said he saw himself as a programmer first and foremost and only joined A.M.G. after deciding that he didn’t want “to play the Internet start-up billionaire game, which is a lot less fun than it looks on paper.” Gaurav Shirole said he was considering a job in the Treasury Department when McLean approached him. “I’m a Silicon Valley kid, so the start-up bug has been there forever.”","Frommann acknowledged having ventured into politics with a certain idealism. “We’ve all watched ‘The West Wing,’ like, four times, and we want to do our small part to change the world,” he said. Politics, he said, was emotionally satisfying. Corporate clients meant new data sets, “stuff I haven’t worked with before, intellectually that’s interesting to me.”","Still, it was hard not to detect some deeper disappointment about what was possible in politics. Frommann told me that in 2010, shortly after college, he joined the Social Security Administration. Within a year, he had helped develop a new system that, he said, would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year. Just as his idea was gaining traction, his entire unit was disbanded, the ostensible result of budget cuts but also, he surmised, bureaucratic infighting. Sometimes, he said, it seems as if political life can be as much like “The West Wing” as it is like “House of Cards,” the Netflix show about a conniving member of Congress living in a kill-or-be-killed Washington.","McLean says Grisolano wooed him by awarding him with the title of chief operating officer and wide latitude to hire whomever he needed. He was also drawn to Grisolano’s sales pitch that the optimizer approach could prove a disruptive force in a $60 billion commercial-advertising industry. It spoke to the same desire to be part of something big that led him to join the first Obama campaign. “This is going to be a huge deal, right?” he said “It’s a multibillion-dollar industry, and we’re going to change the way that it works.”","He said his work at A.M.G. would also help provide the Democratic Party with even better tools three years from now, when he and his colleagues say they want to be involved in 2016. “We’re going to bring it home,” McLean said.","But for now, he does not seem to miss Washington. “I respect everybody who’s working for the president — right? They’re incredible kids — incredible people — but you have a limited movement, because you’re hamstrung; the House is the House,” he said. “When you go where the money is and you go where people get reached, you have a transformational effect. Money creates change.”","Jim Rutenberg is a national political correspondent for The New York Times."],"isopubdate":"2013-06-20"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

In 2011, Facebook agreed to settle charges—though admitted no actual fault—that it \"deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\" among other overreaches.","The settlement barred Facebook from making further deceptive privacy claims, required it obtain a user's explicit approval before changing the way it handles their data, and mandated that Facebook receive periodic assessments of its privacy practices by third-party auditors for the next 20 years. It didn't carry, however, any financial penalties.","'The Federal Trade must bring an enforcement action against Facebook.'","Marc Rotenberg, EPIC","The 2011 consent decree also required that users be notified explicitly if their data is shared beyond the privacy settings they have configured. Specifically, the FTC accused Facebook of telling users that they could limit their data to \"Friends Only,\" whereas in fact this setting did not prevent their information from being shared with third-party applications their friends used. Facebook finally did change this setting in 2014, but it was too late. Facebook may have violated that portion of the settlement by allowing Aleksandr Kogan, an academic at Cambridge University, to obtain data belonging not only to people who downloaded an app he created, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" but also those individuals' friends. The data collected from the app was later passed on to Cambridge Analytica, which reportedly retained it even after telling Facebook it had been deleted.","\"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" Pahl said in the statement Monday announcing the probe. \"Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Facebook says it is willing to answer the FTC's questions. \"We remain committed to protecting people's information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have,\" Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said in a statement.","For privacy advocates, the investigation is a long time coming, but also underscores the FTC's inability to regulate big platforms. \"The confirmation of the investigation is good news. The Federal Trade must bring an enforcement action against Facebook for the violation of the 2011 Consent order,\" Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said in a statement. EPIC has pushed for the FTC to take greater measures to regulate Facebook's data practices for years.","\"Almost everything [the FTC] does is not public, that is a huge drawback to that enforcement approach,\" says Michelle De Mooy, the director of the Privacy & Data Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology. She says that even if the FTC finds that Facebook violated its consent decree, the process by which it came to that conclusion likely won't be made public. The agency's secrecy makes it difficult to know how its enforcement methods may have failed to prevent Facebook and other online platforms from repeatedly engaging in deceptive privacy practices. \"From our perspective it highlights the need for a national privacy law,\" De Mooy says. \"It would ideally give more enforcement powers either to the FTC or to a new agency.\"","If the FTC finds that Facebook failed to comply with the consent decree it agreed to in 2011, it could be liable for trillions of dollars in fines, according to experts who spoke to The Washington Post. Violations of the agreement could carry a financial penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if the social network mishandled 50 million Americans' data, it could face fines up to $2 trillion. It's not clear though that the FTC would necessarily seek the maximum penalty—but even a fraction of that could put a strain even on as large a company as Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

This thinking is popularised in much bandied about expressions like,","“You are the product [Facebook sell to advertisers] not the customer [of Facebook]”","Which sounds clever but doesn’t actually describe the cause of this scandal- Cambridge Analytica got access to the data of these “50 million” consumers when Facebook was (trying to be) something quite different from Facebook of today.","The Zuck in different times.","To reiterate, Facebook being an ad platform is not the problem, them not being one during the early 2010s was what led to the current scandal and consumer outrage.","On their Exponent podcast Ben and James go into more detail on this history. In the 2010s Facebook wanted to be the platform that powered a new web — where every business would build its customer database atop it and every transaction would came through Facebook’s commerce offering etc — no matter where on the web, or what app, a consumer was using.","At this point Facebook were asking consumers for more and more information in order to to give away access to it (via those much demonised APIs) in hope businesses would get addicted to their data-crack. Making Facebook central to a web 3.0.","This never happened. For many reasons — a key one being the rapid shift to mobile devices, on whose simpler interfaces these kind of web experiences didn’t flourish.","So Facebook pivoted. They took the crack pipe out of the hands of developers and repurposed customer’s data into their advertising platform. Largely removing the ability for businesses to suck up individual user’s data and replacing it with an ability to target granular groups of customers — without ever knowing, beyond that targeting, who they were talking to.","Which has turned into a very healthy business. Today businesses pay them handsomely to send communications to their own customers. Businesses must then redirect them to their own platforms to engage, transact and all that money making stuff.","Both brands and consumers can certainly find things to criticise them for in their present state. But Facebook are not the business who were literally pumping out information about consumers, and those consumers friends, to brands a few years ago. Now they jealously guard that information and force brands to pay them to talk to these users.","Let’s criticise them for who they are now, not who they were.

The social network maintains that Cambridge Analytica violated Facebook’s rules, but all of that collected personal data did not come from a hack.","How Cambridge Analytica got the Facebook data","Until the middle of 2014, Facebook allowed apps to abuse a loophole to collect personal data on a user’s entire friend network. In this case, an app not only harvested data from the person using the personality quiz app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" created by U.K. academic Aleksandr Kogan, but also delved into that person’s friends network and harvested all of their Facebook profile data, as well. Facebook claimed only 270,000 people downloaded that app, but Kogan managed to obtain data from 50 million accounts without their consent. Of those, enough data had been harvested from 30 million for Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles on them.","Facebook removed Kogan’s “research” app in 2015 and demanded users’ collected data to be destroyed. Yet several sources have confirmed that the data was not destroyed in 2015.","Sources close to Cambridge Analytica told Wired that the data allegedly deleted in 2015 was still accessible in 2017. The internal Cambridge Analytica database, called “Kogan-import,” had “included Facebook IDs, and responses to personality surveys that had been administered by Kogan in 2015.” This database “was only visible to a small number of staffers in data science, engineering, and IT. The source says the database was tightly controlled in terms of who could edit or delete it.”","On Saturday, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the Senate about the “Facebook breach.”","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","In a series of rapid-fire and later-deleted tweets made on Saturday, Facebook CSO Alex Stamos took exception to the “breach” terminology. Stamos then said he deleted them “not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.”","Cambridge Analytica responds","Cambridge Analytica put out its own statement after Facebook’s announcement, claiming it deleted all the data obtained by Global Science Research, which had been contracted in 2014, after learning the data had be obtained outside of Facebook’s terms of service. The firm added, “No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Whistleblower Chritopher Wylie tells his story","Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica, can help you fully understand the scope of what happened and how it “exploited” Facebook.","Wylie is sorry for the role he played in the “full service propaganda machine.” He added that “it was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country. The psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.”","How many times will people accept Facebook’s version of truth — that “protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook”? Over and over throughout the years, despite carefully worded statements after some privacy fiasco, Facebook has proven that users’ privacy is not at the heart of the company. Making money via collecting data about users to sell ads is.","Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) added, “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

They are sent to the site on each visit and can therefore be used to identify a user’s computer and track their movements across the web.","Cookies allow saved preferences and other important features of websites and services, but can be used to track and identify users.

This includes information about the websites and apps you visit, your use of our services on those websites and apps, as well as information the developer or publisher of the app or website provides to you or us,” states Facebook’s data usage policy, which was updated this year.","Facebook’s tracking practices have ‘no legal basis’","An opinion published by Article 29, the pan-European data regulator working party, in 2012 stated that unless delivering a service specifically requested by the user, social plug-ins must have consent before placing a cookie. “Since by definition social plug-ins are destined to members of a particular social network, they are not of any use for non-members, and therefore do not match ‘criterion B’ for those users.”","The same applies for users of Facebook who are logged out at the time, while logged-in users should only be served a “session cookie” that expires when the user logs out or closes their browser, according to Article 29.","The Article 29 working party has also said that cookies set for “security purposes” can only fall under the consent exemptions if they are essential for a service explicitly requested by the user - not general security of the service.","Facebook’s cookie policy updated this year states that the company still uses cookies if users do not have a Facebook account, or are logged out, to “enable us to deliver, select, evaluate, measure and understand the ads we serve on and off Facebook”.","The social network tracks its users for advertising purposes across non-Facebook sites by default. Users can opt out of ad tracking, but an opt-out mechanism “is not an adequate mechanism to obtain average users informed consent”, according to Article 29.","“European legislation is really quite clear on this point. To be legally valid, an individual’s consent towards online behavioural advertising must be opt-in,” explained Brendan Van Alsenoy, a researcher at ICRI and one of the report’s author.","Facebook’s privacy policy breaches European law, report finds","Read more","“Facebook cannot rely on users’ inaction (ie not opting out through a third-party website) to infer consent. As far as non-users are concerned, Facebook really has no legal basis whatsoever to justify its current tracking practices.”","Opt-out mechanism actually enables tracking for the non-tracked","The researchers also analysed the opt-out mechanism used by Facebook and many other internet companies including Google and Microsoft.","Users wanting to opt out of behavioural tracking are directed to sites run by the Digital Advertising Alliance in the US, Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada in Canada or the European Digital Advertising Alliance in the EU, each of which allow bulk opting-out from 100 companies.","But the researchers discovered that far from opting out of tracking, Facebook places a new cookie on the computers of users who have not been tracked before.","“If people who are not being tracked by Facebook use the ‘opt out’ mechanism proposed for the EU, Facebook places a long-term, uniquely identifying cookie, which can be used to track them for the next two years,” explained Günes Acar from Cosic, who also co-wrote the report. “What’s more, we found that Facebook does not place any long-term identifying cookie on the opt-out sites suggested by Facebook for US and Canadian users.”","The finding was confirmed by Steven Englehardt, a researcher at Princeton University’s department of computer science who was not involved in the report: “I started with a fresh browsing session and received an additional ‘datr’ cookie that appears capable of uniquely identifying users on the UK version of the European opt-out site. This cookie was not present during repeat tests with a fresh session on the US or Canadian version.”","Facebook sets an opt-out cookie on all the opt-out sites, but this cookie cannot be used for tracking individuals since it does not contain a unique identifier. Why Facebook places the “datr” cookie on computers of EU users who opt out is unknown.","‘Privacy-friendly’ design","For users worried about tracking, third-party browser add-ons that block tracking are available, says Acar: “Examples include Privacy Badger, Ghostery and Disconnect. Privacy Badger replaces social plug-ins with privacy preserving counterparts so that users can still use social plug-ins, but not be tracked until they actually click on them.","“We argue that it is the legal duty of Facebook to design its services and components in a privacy-friendly way,” Van Alsenoy added. “This means designing social plug-ins in such a way that information about individual’s personal browsing activities outside of Facebook are not unnecessarily exposed.”","Facebook is being investigated by the Dutch data protection authority, which asked the social network to delay rollout of its new privacy policy, and is being probed by the Article 29 working party.","A Facebook spokesperson said: “This report contains factual inaccuracies. The authors have never contacted us, nor sought to clarify any assumptions upon which their report is based. Neither did they invite our comment on the report before making it public. We have explained in detail the inaccuracies in the earlier draft report (after it was published) directly to the Belgian DPA, who we understand commissioned it, and have offered to meet with them to explain why it is incorrect, but they have declined to meet or engage with us. However, we remain willing to engage with them and hope they will be prepared to update their work in due course.”","“Earlier this year we updated our terms and policies to make them more clear and concise, to reflect new product features and to highlight how we’re expanding people’s control over advertising.

His statement, which acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in responding to the situation, wasn’t much of an apology—Zuckerberg and Facebook have repeatedly demonstrated they seem to have a hard time saying they’re sorry.","For me, Zuckerberg’s statement fell short in a very specific way: He’s treating the Cambridge Analytica breach as a bad-actor problem when it’s actually a known bug.","In the 17-months-long conversation Americans have been having about social media’s effects on democracy, two distinct sets of problems have emerged. The ones getting the most attention are bad-actor problems—where someone breaks the rules and manipulates a social-media system for their own nefarious ends. Macedonian teenagers create sensational and false content to profit from online ad sales. Disinformation experts plan rallies and counterrallies, calling Americans into the streets to scream at each other. Botnets amplify posts and hashtags, building the appearance of momentum behind online campaigns like #releasethememo. Such problems are the charismatic megafauna of social-media dysfunction. They’re fascinating to watch and fun to study—who wouldn’t be intrigued by the team of Russians in St. Petersburg who pretended to be Black Lives Matter activists and anti-Clinton fanatics in order to add chaos to the presidential election in the United States? Charismatic megafauna may be the things that attract all the attention—when really there are smaller organisms, some invisible to the naked eye, that can dramatically shift the health of an entire ecosystem.","Known bugs are the set of problems with social media that aren’t the result of Russian agents, enterprising Macedonians, or even Steve Bannon, but seem to simply come with the territory of building a social network. People are mean online, and bullying, harassment, and mob behavior make online spaces unusable for many people. People tend to get stuck in cocoons of unchallenging, ideologically compatible information online, whether these are “filter bubbles\" created by algorithms, or simply echo chambers built through homophily and people’s friendships with “birds of a feather.” Conspiracy theories thrive online, and searching for information can quickly lead to extreme and disturbing content.","The Cambridge Analytica breach is a known bug in two senses. Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher who built a quiz to collect data on tens of millions of people, didn’t break into Facebook’s servers and steal data. He used the Facebook Graph API, which until April 2015 allowed people to build apps that harvested data both from people who chose to use the app, and from their Facebook friends. As the media scholar Jonathan Albright put it, “The ability to obtain unusually rich info about users’ friends—is due to the design and functionality of Facebook’s Graph API. Importantly, the vast majority of problems that have arisen as a result of this integration were meant to be ‘features, not bugs.’”","In his non-apology, Zuckerberg claimed Facebook had already taken the most “important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information.” But changing the API Kogan used to collect this data is only a small part of a much bigger story.","To be clear, I believe Kogan acted unethically in allegedly collecting this data in the first place, and that giving this data to Cambridge Analytica was an unforgivable breach of research ethics. But Kogan was able to do this because Facebook made it possible, not just for him, but for anyone building apps using the Graph API. When Kogan claims he’s being made a scapegoat by both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, he has a strong case: Selling data to Cambridge Analytica is wrong, sure, but Facebook knew that people like Kogan could access the data of millions of users. That’s precisely the functionality Facebook advertised to app developers.","Speaking with Laurie Segall on CNN this week, Zuckerberg emphasized that Facebook would investigate other app makers to see if anyone else was selling psychographic data they’ve collected through the Graph API. But Zuck didn’t mention that Facebook’s business model is based on collecting this demographic and psychographic information and selling the ability to target ads to people using this data about them.","This is a known bug not just for Facebook and other social networks, but for the vast majority of the contemporary web. Like Facebook, Google develops profiles of its users, with information from people’s private searches and tools like Gmail and office applications, to help advertisers target messages to them. As you read this article on The Atlantic, roughly three dozen ad trackers are watching you, adding your interest in this story to profiles they maintain on your online behavior. (If you want to know more about who’s watching you, download Ghostery, a browser extension that tracks and can block these “third-party” trackers.) The Atlantic is not unusual. Most ad-supported websites track their users, as part of agreements that seek to make their ad inventory more valuable.","I’ve referred to this bargain, in which people get content and services for free in exchange for having persuasive messages psychographically targeted to them, as the “original sin” of the internet. It’s a dangerous and socially corrosive business model that puts internet users under constant surveillance and continually pulls our attention from the tasks we want to do online toward the people paying to hijack our attention. It’s a terrible model that survives only because we haven’t found another way to reliably support most internet content and services—including getting individuals to pay for the things they claim to value.","We become aware of how uncomfortable this model is when Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica develop personality profiles of us so they can tailor persuasive messages to our specific personal quirks, but that’s exactly what any competent advertiser is doing, every day, on nearly every site online. If that makes you feel uncomfortable: Good, it should. But the problem is way bigger than Facebook. This is a known bug not just with social networks, but with the contemporary, ad-supported web as a whole.","It’s relatively easy for social networks to address bad-actor problems. For the most part, social networks would be better off without bots artificially promoting posts or fabricated news capturing clicks. Platform interests are aligned with society’s interests as a whole in fighting bad actors.","It’s different with known bugs.","When platforms address them, they run the risk of breaking their business models. It’s hard for YouTube to fix a recommendation engine that leads us toward conspiracy-theory videos without breaking a system that encourages us to surf from one popular video to the next, racking up ad views in the process. It’s hard—though not impossible—to fix harassment and bullying on Twitter when many of Twitter’s most engaged users are opinionated and sharp-tongued and their arguments are some of the most compelling content on the service. And it’s impossible for Facebook to protect us from manipulative advertising targeted to our psychographic profile when their business model is built on selling this particular form of persuasion.","Platforms won’t fix known bugs on their own, not without external pressure. In his interview with Segall, Zuckerberg acknowledged that it might be time for regulation of Facebook, suggesting standards that force transparency around who’s paying for ads. We should push Facebook, and the web as a whole, to do much more to address this known bug, and others.","Users of the internet have been forced into a bargain they had no hand in negotiating: You get the services you want, and platforms get the data they need. We need the right to opt out of this bargain, paying for services like Facebook or YouTube in exchange for verifiable assurances that our usage isn’t being tracked and that our behavioral data is not being sold. We need an ecosystem that encourages competitors to existing social-media platforms, which means ensuring a right to export data from existing social networks and new software that lets us experiment with new services while maintaining contacts on existing ones. We need to treat personally identifiable information less like a resource to be exploited and more like toxic waste, which must be carefully managed, as Maciej Ceglowski has proposed. This may require a digital EPA, as Franklin Foer, Paul Ford, and others have argued—a prospect that would be more appealing if the actual EPA wasn’t currently being gutted.","Critically, we need the scholars, philanthropists, and policy makers who’ve woken up to the problems of bad actors on the internet to pay attention to the known bugs as well. Addressing the effects of echo chambers, polarization, and psychographic persuasion may not be as sexy as unmasking Russian botnets, but the botnets are a merely a symptom of a much larger problem.","Tribalism, manipulation, and misinformation are well-established forces in American politics, all predating the web. But something fundamental has changed. Never before have we had the technological infrastructure to support the weaponization of emotion on a global scale. The people who built this infrastructure have a moral obligation to own up to what they’ve done. On some level, in some way, Zuckerberg must know that. “We have a responsibility to protect your data,” he said in his statement, “and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.” Nor does he deserve our support if he and his peers don’t address the known bugs that are corroding democracy.","We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.","Ethan Zuckerman is the director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT and an associate professor in the Practice at MIT Media Lab.

That's the real scandal. An enforceable bill of rights is necessary, with rigorous, not lily-livered, freedom of speech as the first article, with life sentences for any officials or agents of the government found to have broken these rights.","Agree with most.

Its shares fell a further 1.8%.","In London, the head of Britain’s cross-party Media parliamentary committee also wrote to Zuckerberg asking for more information. “We would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March,” lawmaker Damian Collins wrote.","In Dublin, Ireland’s privacy watchdog said it was following up with Facebook to clarify its oversight. The Irish body is the lead regulator for Facebook in the European Union because the network’s European headquarters are in Dublin.","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.","According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by the-then future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon.","Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also their friends’.","Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.","Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.","Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.","Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.","Grave violation","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica’s London office, among other companies. It was not clear which firm they were going to.","“We are not alone in using data from social media sites to extract user information,” Cambridge Analytica said. “No Facebook data was used by our data science team in the 2016 presidential campaign.”","Denham, head of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said on Monday she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after seeing an investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 news which secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections.","She said it would not take long to obtain the warrant.","“We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection,” Cambridge Analytica said.","Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data. The auditors were in Cambridge Analytica’s offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities.","The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds ($700,000) but will gain the power to fine an organisation up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","“This story comes on the back of increasing scrutiny and societal unease with FB’s potential impact on kids as well as increasing concerns around the power of mega cap Internet names, setting the stage for deeper investigation,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note, keeping his “buy” rating on Facebook stock.","Walmsley said he was worried “about how scrutiny could ultimately impact Facebook’s ability to gather and deploy data for ad targeting, which has been critical to ad efficacy and budget growth”.","The company said last month it had 1.4 billion active daily users, up 14 percent from a year earlier. But the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in its history, dipping in the company’s home market by 700,000 from a quarter earlier to 184 million.

Kushner--President Trump's son-in-law and close aide who recently orchestrated the President's trips to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Rome--is credited with spearheading both the Trump campaign and the data analytics program that delivered the White House. CNN reports the FBI is now looking into that data and analytics operation, as well as Kushner's meetings with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and the head of a Kremlin-affiliated bank, Sergey Gorkov. Kushner has not been named a subject of any investigation, nor has he been accused of anycrimeor wrongdoing.","\"Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings,” according to a statement from Kushner’s lawyer, Jamie Gorelick. “He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.\"","Trump top aide, Jared Kushner(Jamel Toppin for Forbes)","So what does Jared Kushner have to say about the formidable data operation, which Forbes has previously said tipped the election to Trump? In November, Forbes went into deep detail on this topic with Kushner for a cover story on the little-known facet of the campaign. And Kushner had far more to say than we could include that story. Below are the never-before-published quotes from Kushner, on the Trump campaign and its data strategy.","“We found that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. After the primary, we started ramping up because we knew that doing a national campaign is different than doing a primary campaign. That was when we formalized the system because we had to ramp up for digital fundraising. We brought in Cambridge Analytica. I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley who were some of the best digital marketers in the world. And I asked them how to scale this stuff. Doing it state by state is not that hard. But scaling is a very, very hard thing. They gave me a lot of their subcontractors and I built in Austin a data hub that would complement the RNC's data hub. We had about 100 people in that office, which nobody knew about, until towards the end. We used that as the nerve center that drove a lot of the deployment of our ground game resources.","\"We spent a lot of time figuring out how to build a bridge between the Trump campaign and the RNC so that we could analyze the resources they had available. We found that they had a pretty good ground force that we could leverage. We used some of our best practices and some of their best practices. We kept both data operations going simultaneously—and a lot shared between them. And by doing that, we could scale to a pretty good operation.\"","\"We played Moneyball, where we were asking, ‘Which states are will be the most cost effective—ROI per electoral vote.’ We used a lot things to get much more bang for the buck… We got rid of a lot of the political people. That's not who we hired. Our best people were mostly people who volunteered pro bono, people from the business world, people from nontraditional fields. We could squeeze the margin so that nobody was getting rich on it. And we only had people who were doing it for the right reasons, not because they wanted to go onto the next campaign, but because they felt passionately about getting Donald Trump elected.\"","\"We ran the campaign like a business. We tried a lot of new things. We weren't afraid to make changes. We weren't afraid to fail. I found in politics is people build these big, bureaucratic machines designed not to make mistakes and not to have anyone to blame. We tried to do things very cheaply, very quickly. And if it wasn't going to work, we would kill it quickly. The media would write a quick story saying, ‘They don't know what they're doing.’ But we were just saying, ‘Look, we tried, it didn't work. Move onto the next.’\"","\"We did an analysis about where you spend your money. For example, a market like New Hampshire is a very, very expensive market. So your cost per vote--and thus cost per electoral vote-- is going to be substantially higher than someplace else. Take a market like Florida, we analyzed the different aspects of the state. We did our TV buying, our digital buying, our walking, our phones, all based on geographically. We asked, 'how we can get the best ROI because every vote is the same.' But some votes are more expensive to get. Some votes are less expensive to get. We were very data driven in terms of how we could always judge what the ROI was.\"","\"It's a massive startup. We basically had to build a $400 million operation with 1,500 people operating in 50 states, in five months to then be taken apart. We started really from scratch... So you're going to make hiring mistakes... It's just problem solving, problem solving, problem solving. And making quick decisions. And then fixing things that are broken, and then scaling things that are working.\"","\"If you're consumer product company, you're going to look at what's your ROI, what's your cost to reach the voter. You have ten different ways that you could reach the potential consumer. You ask, 'How can I get my message to that consumer for the least amount of cost?' We did that and measured that very aggressively. But you also don't want under-touch them or over-touch them… The RNC had a lot of good methodology that they used where we started backwards and say, 'Look, to win the state of Florida, we need to get to X number of votes.’ And then we'd back up and say, ‘How many votes do we have in the bag?’ And we had two different target groups that we had to try to turn out.\"","\"We had a very good ground game. The Democrat machine, which we were up against, is a phenomenal machine. After Obama won the first time, they basically just kept the operation in place and kept building on it, building on it, building on it. I was very impressed with the operation that they had. We didn't have the same level of resources. We didn't have the same level of institutional buildup. But what we did have was a lot of very devoted, good people who were just putting their heads down and-- and grinding and getting the work done.\"","I cover the Forbes Under 30 franchise, technology, entrepreneurs, billionaires and VC's.

Twitter,\nWhatsapp, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, you name it. Oh yeah, and of course\nFacebook…","It hardly matters at which moment of the day or at which\nlocation one meets strangers. There is always a well above average chance that\nthese people are totally absorbed by their mobile phones, iPads and Notebooks. In\nthe bus, in the metro, just before or during meetings, during lunch or during a\ncigarette break and even in the discotheque... people are staring at their cellphones\nand iPads.","And no, people are probably not watching their phones\nor other wireless appliances to read their business emails, to make some last\nminute changes to their university paper or to send an invitation to their colleagues\nto let them visit an important meeting.","No, most people use their cellphones mostly for fun and\nleisure, by reading and posting items on the social media of their choice.","I understand that very well… Personally, I am an avid\nuser of Twitter (for fun and hobby) and LinkedIn (for business).","For me it is much fun to react to the opinions of politicians,\nexperts, journalists and pundits on Twitter or to share my own thoughts\nregarding things that happened on the news or in real life. Twitter is always topical,\nand a “short, sharp shock” when it comes to opinions and events. Some of the\npeople there come close to being a ´kind of friend´, without ever really becoming\none.","Twitter is a very volatile medium and that’s what I\nlike about it. Last week´s discussions are “old news from the dark ages” and\ntoday’s hypes and scandals are the hottest thing around. If you ever watched a national\nfootball match or a talent show with Twitter comments on, you know what I mean.","And while many users use Twitter to spill their guts\nabout almost anything, it are the quality of numerous discussions and the\ninteraction with the real experts and with some of the dearer twitter users that\nkeeps me hooked to it, And that, in spite of all the negative stories about the\n´content being vulgar´ and the general chances for survival of this medium.","And LinkedIn? While this\nsocial medium bored me “beyond belief” in its early days, it has\nevolved into a darn good tool for networking and finding new assignments\n(always important for freelance professionals), as well as a service-hatch for\nvery interesting stories from people that I respect – including my own stories.\nAnd while LinkedIn is not exactly something that I visit for fun, it\nnevertheless proved its quality to me.","That brings me to Facebook. From all the aforementioned\nsocial media, Facebook is by far the most popular (except perhaps for Whatsapp\nin sheer numbers of users) and the most successful social medium. Period!","Personally, I did not and I still don’t like it! I even\ndisliked it so much that a few weeks ago I decided to abolish my profile on\nFacebook and make this medium something of the past for me.","Let’s begin with Facebook’s slogan. I take here the\ntranslated Dutch slogan, as it is so much more direct than the quite disguised\nEnglish slogan:","Isn’t that the creepiest slogan ever? That you are\ncursed to “share EVERYTHING with\nEVERYBODY in your life”?","The heck, I won’t!","When I share information and things through social\nmedia, I do it out of my own free will and in the possession of my full mental\npowers.","Although I always hope to do something good with my\nblogs and tweets and try to make people laugh, enjoy something, (dis)agree with\nme and make them think about certain subjects or wonder about some marvelous things,\nI don’t want to receive report marks (i.e. the ‘like’ or future ‘dislike’\nbutton) for my writings. If you like my tweets and articles, it is appreciated and\nif you hate my guts... be my guest! I love getting\na letter from my readers, especially when they felt aided or comforted\nby some of my articles or want to have information about particular subjects,\nbut that is neither my intention for writing nor my ultimate goal.","With Blogger, Twitter and LinkedIn, this is OK, but it\nis not with Facebook seemingly.","Facebook wants indeed to know everything from all its\nusers and it wants its users to put their whole life on Facebook:","When\nyou\ndo something or when something happens to you, you put this on Facebook, where\nit in fact acts as a source for positive or negative assessments by others;","When you get new lovers, friends or business relations,\nFacebook wants to turn them into its own relations and friends and disclose the\nnetwork that is emerging behind it;","When you write a tweet, you often put it on Facebook at\nthe same time, sometimes without realizing that;","When you post a picture on it, Facebook immediately\nconsiders that to be its own picture, which it can use for its own purposes,\nwithout further consent;","Facebook wants you to be online as long as possible (24/7)\nand it wants to make you share, share, share…","Facebook bombards you with long, long lists of remote\nacquaintances and far relatives, hoping that it can push you to expand your own\n(and in the process their) network;","And when you react to somebody else’s posts or adverts\nthrough the ‘like’-button or through your comments, you start a whole machinery,\ntrying to make you hand over even more personal information or buy advertized\nstuff eventually;","Facebook wants you to use its instant messaging\nservices, its fixed telephony and its cellphone services, so it can gather even\nmore personal information about you, without you realizing that;","In its ways to comfort you as a user and make life\neasier for you – seemingly for free – Facebook seems a benevolent organization,\nthat is created to help the human race and bring it on a higher level of\ninterconnectedness.","Yet you have to remember that YOU are indeed the\nproduct for Facebook and that EVERYTHING you do is closely monitored by\nFacebook, in order to generate more information and thus eventually more cash\nin the process.","And in my humble opinion, Facebook has proven in the\npast that European and national privacy laws are nothing more than an annoying\nobstacle on its road towards total control of information. An obstacle that can\nbe defeated and/or ignored.","In its modus operandi, Facebook sometimes reminds me of\nHedra Carlson, the scary tenant in the film “Single White\nFemale”, so intensely played by actress Jennifer Jason Leigh.","At first, Hedra seems to be the perfect companion and “Best\nFriend Forever” of landlady Allison Jones (Bridget Fonda), until she notices\nthat Hedra is more and more involved in taking over Allison’s total life, at\nthe expense of Allison herself. The end of this movie is very discomforting,\neven though the heroine of the story survives in the end…","At this moment I don’t have any tangible reasons to\naccuse Facebook of having more suspicious goals than earning loads of money at my\nand other people’s expense, through the collection of as much information as\npossible. Nevertheless, it is exactly this intrusive ‘nature of the beast’ and\nthis relentless pushing to become an indispensable ‘Best Friends Forever’ that\nbother me very much about Facebook.","Through my writings and tweets, I chose to be a ‘public\nperson’ and I am aware of the consequences that such things can have;\npositively or negatively.","However, my wife did not choose to become a public\nperson through things that I do on the internet. And especially my three\nchildren do not own the luxury of having a real, well-considered choice yet, as\nthey are simply too young for such a choice.","Still, Facebook would probably “die” to know everything\nabout me, my wife and children and all my friends. Not because we are interesting\nas persons, but because we are interesting as marketing instruments.","I initially created my Facebook profile about three or four\nyears ago in order to look up some data of an old school friend who I had not\nseen for years. Initially, it offered me a chance to look up some old acquaintances,\nbut those Facebook contacts did hardly lead to something more interesting in\nreal life. Since then, I just left my profile hanging on, as I was further not\nreally interested in the contents on Facebook. Every now and then I watched my\nprofile and pending messages – perhaps about every three months – and sometimes\nI posted a comment to some event. And every time when I wrote a Blogger\narticle, I posted it on Facebook, as yet another medium to post links to my\narticles.","A few weeks ago, at one particular moment, I had simply\nhad it with Facebook. I had it because Facebook still published all my tweets\nunasked, without me standing still with that. And I had it, because it came up\nwith the remotest of acquaintances, gathered from all my email and other social\nmedia contacts, asking me to become friends with those people and further build\nup my network on Facebook’s behalf. And for no particular reason, I simply\nwanted to get out…","Then I was confronted with the fact that Facebook does\nnot make it easy on a person, when he wants to get out of it. After I looked in\nvain for half an hour within the tool, to find a way to really abolish my\nprofile (instead of just disabling it), I managed to do so with the help of one\ndedicated site. Afterwards, I found out that Facebook granted me an involuntary\ncool-down period of two weeks. A period, in which a person cannot make use of\nFacebook anymore per accident or else... (he will be reconnected again).","And now I am in the final days of my Facebook\nmembership. Everybody who thinks that I will feel sorry for my decision to stop\nusing it, does not know me really well.","Even though I have my public life on Twitter, LinkedIn,\nBlogger and some of the other social networks, I want to spend the other parts\nof my life in the privacy to which I am entitled. And that privacy especially\nstretches to my loved ones and other family.","I will not discourage people to use Facebook, when they\nhave a good time with it and enjoy its possibilities, while taking the\ndrawbacks for granted. I just wanted to tell you my motivation to abolish it\nfor good.","Do with that and think about that what you want, as I\nam not really interested in your opinions about my acts and motivation in such\nmatters.

Cambridge Analytica, the data firm he worked with – which funded the project to turn tens of millions of Facebook profiles into a unique political weapon – also attracted interest from a key Russian firm with links to the Kremlin.","Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed “micro-targeting” individuals on social media during elections.","The revelations come at a time of intense US scrutiny of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, with 13 Russians criminally charged last month with interfering to help Donald Trump.","In Britain, concerns about Russian propaganda have been mounting, with the prime minister, Theresa May, recently attacking Russia for spreading fake news, accusing Moscow of attempts to “weaponise information” and influence polls.","Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, discussed with Cambridge Analytica the data company’s powerful social media marketing system, which was already being deployed for Republican Ted Cruz in the US presidential primaries and was later used to back Brexit and Trump.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, emailed colleagues after initial contacts to say that Lukoil wanted a clearer explanation of “how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business”.","“They understand behavioural micro-targeting in the context of elections (as per your excellent document/white paper) but they are failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers,” he wrote in an email seen by the Observer.","A slide presentation prepared for the Lukoil pitch focuses first on election disruption strategies used by Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, in Nigeria. They are presented under the heading “Election: Inoculation”, a military term used in “psychological operations” and disinformation campaigns. Other SCL documents show that the material shared with Lukoil included posters and videos apparently aimed at alarming or demoralising voters, including warnings of violence and fraud.","Discussion of services offered by Cambridge Analytica was apparently going right to the top of Lukoil, even though its retail operations in America are a very minor corner of the oil and gas giant’s empire. Asking for a detailed presentation of Cambridge Analyticas’s work in July 2014, Nix told his colleague the document would be “shared with the CEO of the business”.","The chief executive of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, is a former Soviet oil minister who has said the strategic aims of Lukoil are closely aligned with those of Russia. “I have only one task connected with politics, to help the country and the company. I’m not close to Mr Putin, but I treat him with great respect,” he told the New York Times.","Cambridge Analytica said an affiliate company had talked to Lukoil Turkey about a loyalty card scheme and proposed a pilot study with a small number of petrol stations there, but the project had not gone ahead. “[The talks] were about potential commercial work in Turkey and did not involve any discussion of political work,” a spokesman said. “Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate companies have not worked in Russia and have not worked for a Russian company or organisation.”","Last month Nix told MPs: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do no have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","That appears to contradict the company documents seen by the Observer, that list Russia as one of the countries where Cambridge Analytica and affiliate companies have clients.","Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who has come forward to talk to the Observer, said it was never entirely clear what the Russian firm hoped to get from the operation.","“Alexander Nix’s presentation didn’t make any sense to me,” said Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica soon after the initial meetings. “If this was a commercial deal, why were they so interested in our political targeting?”","Lukoil did not respond to requests for comments.","Kogan, a lecturer who worked with Cambridge Analytica on building up the database of US voters then at the heart of the company’s plans, said he had not had any connection to the Lukoil pitch.","But while he was helping turn Facebook profiles into a political tool he was also an associate professor at St Petersburg State University, taking Russian government grants to fund other research into social media. “Stress, health, and psychological wellbeing in social networks: cross-cultural investigation” was the title of one piece of research. Online posts showed Kogan lecturing in Russian. One talk was called: “New methods of communication as an effective political instrument”.","Cambridge University said academics are allowed to take on outside work but are expected to inform their head of institution, a rule Kogan had complied with. “We understand that Dr Kogan informed his head of department of discussions with St Petersburg University regarding a collaboration; it was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity,” a spokesman said.","Apart from that, Kogan appears to have largely kept the work private. Colleagues said they had not heard about the post in St Petersburg. “I am very surprised by that. No one knew,” one academic who asked not to be named told the Observer. Russia is not mentioned in a 10-page CV Kogan posted on a university website in 2015. The CV lists undergraduate prizes and grants of a few thousand dollars and links to dozens of media interviews.","One Cambridge Analytica employee mentioned Kogan’s Russian work in an email to Nix in March 2014 discussing a pitch to a Caribbean nation for a security contract, including “criminal psychographic profiling via intercepts”.","“We may want to either loop in or find out a bit more about the interesting work Alex Kogan has been doing for the Russians and see how/if it applies,” the colleague wrote.","Kogan told the Observer: “Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way. No data or models.” His recollection was that the Russia project had started a year after his collaboration with Cambridge Analytica ended.","He said the St Petersburg position emerged by chance on a social visit. A native Russian speaker, Kogan was born in Moldova and brought up in Moscow until he was seven, when his family emigrated to the US, where he later obtained citizenship.","However, he stayed in touch with family friends in Russia and visited regularly. On one trip, he said, he “dropped an email” to the psychology department at St Petersburg.","“We met, had a nice chat, and decided let’s try to collaborate – give me more reason to visit there,” he told the Observer in an email.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

The data was used as part of a \"microtargeting\" campaign to try to predict and influence voters' choices in the election.","Facebook has issued a statement about the suspension of Cambridge Analytics and SCL, saying: \"Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.\" The social network goes on to explain how Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, violated its policies.","He created an app called thisisyourdigitallife which was presented as a \"a research app used by psychologists\" and promised to give a personality prediction.

What was not fine was the fact that Kogan then passed this data on to third parties, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. (Wylie later turned whistleblower.)","When Facebook heard about this, the thisisyourdigitallife was removed, and the company demanded that Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie destroy the data that had been collected, and provide proof that this had been done. In its explanatory statement, Facebook then says:","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

He said his job was to build “models to exploit what we knew about them [users] and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","In a video interview with The Guardian, Wylie referred to his former line of work as “grossly unethical experiments.” Backed by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, Cambridge Analytica at one time was headed by Steve Bannon. Not mincing his words, Wylie said his position under Bannon was to help him create a “psychological warfare mindfuck tool.”","The data was harvested from an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that used a paid-testing procedure to collect information, but unbeknownst to the test-takers it was also allegedly collecting information on their Facebook friends. The app was built by Cambridge University psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, and it seems participants thought the information was supposed to be used for academic research purposes.","Cambridge Analytica worked on President Trump’s 2016 campaign and played a major role in shaping opinions on the run-up to the EU Brexit referendum. “The company was founded on using Facebook data,” said Wylie, adding that by using this data it could manipulate people’s opinions by first using data scientists, psychologists and strategists and to then focus on content creation and “inject it into the Internet.”","Once user data had been studied, said Wylie, it was just a matter of creating tailored content for those users to find somewhere online. “You are whispering into the ear of every voter,” he said. “This was the weapon that Steve Bannon wanted to build to fight his culture war.”","Facebook had known about this collection of user information but said that it had received guarantees that the data would be deleted. It has now suspended the company and also the affiliated company Strategic Communications Laboratories.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made,” Facebook Vice President and General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a blog post.","That post was updated a day later, stating that the claim that there had been a data “breach” was false. “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” said Facebook.","The app in question was a kind of personality quiz, but users, seemingly unwittingly, supplied a lot of personal information and in some cases their friends list – depending on what their privacy settings were. After taking the quiz, Wylie said, it was possible to know how users would react to certain content and to understand what they were susceptible to.","Only 270,000 people downloaded the app, but because it was able to collect information on friends, the number of harvested accounts is thought to number about 50 million in total. Kogan was able to create psychographic profiles of these people, which relates to personality rather than demographics.","Kogan then gave this information to Cambridge Analytica, but in 2015 Facebook found out about the harvesting and removed the app. Apparently, Facebook was told all the data had been deleted. It seems that wasn’t the case. Grewal said Facebook was presently making sure that the “data in question is deleted once and for all” and that it will “take action against all offending parties.”","Currently there are ripples forming across the pond in the U.K. as well as in the U.S. An inquiry into data and politics is being led by the British Information Commissioner’s Office, while the Electoral Commission is looking into how all this may have affected the Brexit vote. In the U.S, lawmakers have also begun investigating the practice of data harvesting and more specifically what was done with the information.","This is certainly a rough patch the social media giant is going through, along with the revelations of Russian propaganda disseminated on the platform. There has also been a lot of negative press of late regarding the potentially harmful characteristics of the site in terms of addiction or psychological manipulation.","How will this affect Facebook’s bottom line? Probably not, said eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson, and in fact the research firm forecasts that the company will see worldwide ad spending rise 22 percent this year, when it’s expected to gain share of the overall online ad market. But she said advertisers are likely to reconsider how they handle Facebook user data.","“Facebook’s advertising system depends on user data, and it has used that data to develop targeted advertising capabilities that are better than any other company can offer,” she said in an email. “If Facebook were forced to change the way it uses data or the way its ad products work, then advertisers may become less enamored with it.”","And according to a client note from Pivotal Research Group, Facebook likely won’t see much of a difference financially either. “We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook, although the company’s business won’t likely be meaningfully impacted for now because we don’t think advertisers will suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform,” said Wieser, who has had a sell rating on Facebook’s shares for some time.","Moreover, Facebook no doubt will have to steer through a few storms in the coming weeks, including intensified regulatory risks. Enhanced use of data in advertising will be at greater risk than before and third-party measurement partners may face more restrictions, frustrating advertisers, Wieser said.","Since you’re here …","… We’d like to tell you about our mission and how you can help us fulfill it. SiliconANGLE Media Inc.’s business model is based on the intrinsic value of the content, not advertising.

Some of those services may have leveraged your data to undermine the very foundations of American democracy. Hard to say!","New reports from the Guardianand New York Timesreveal how a Trump-aligned data-gathering service called Cambridge Analytica \"exploited\" information from millions of people in the lead-up to the 2016 election. It was pretty simple: The firm created a personality test app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" and people opted in to take it, granting the app permission to scrape their personal data in the process. It also harvested their friends' data.","Facebook has a lot to answer for, but in the meantime, you might be curious to see if you've given sketchy apps access to your data over the years. There's a very good chance you have: I found today that 170 apps were able to access some level of my personal Facebook data. Some of them definitely seem off.","Though Facebook is fairly transparent about what kind of data apps are able to access when you connect them to your profile, granting permission on an indefinite basis only requires a couple of taps. And until now, users might reasonably expect that simple personality quizzes or one-off games weren't being used to create a complex network for the purposes of voter manipulation.","In other words, it's a good time to check in.","Here's how to check your app settings on Facebook:","- On desktop, click the downward facing arrow in the upper-right side of your News Feed. Then, click \"Settings.\"","- From there, tap \"Apps\" in the left-hand sidebar.","- On mobile, tap the icon showing three stacked lines. The icon is on top of your screen if you're using the Android app, and it's on the bottom if you're on iOS.","- Then, tap \"Settings.\" You may need to scroll down a bit to find it. Tap \"Account Settings,\" then scroll down and tap \"Apps.\"","- Finally, tap \"Logged in with Facebook\" to see the services accessing your account.","Once you're here, you'll be able to see all of the apps you've logged into with Facebook. A lot of them, like Airbnb or Amazon, are probably fine! But others should give you pause. For example, this embarrassing Pokemon personality quiz I took years ago:","It has access to a ton of my data, including my relationship status, friend list, and birthday. Needless to say, I clicked \"Remove App\" to get rid of it.","I don't remember taking this quiz—or, tragically, which Pokemon I am—though Facebook would reasonably say I opted into it and am therefore responsible for any data I hand over to it. But I signed up for it a long time ago, likely when I was intoxicated, and who knows what it's taken from me since then.","So: Take as much responsibility for yourself and your data as you can, because it impacts your friends, too. Dig through your connected apps. Remove some of them if you must. And hey, maybe think about deleting Facebook all together.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” href=\"https://twitter.com/MassAGO/status/975052674818347013\"> Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Do you often feel blue? Do you have a sharp tongue? Do you get chores done right away? Do you believe in the importance of art?","If ever you’ve answered questions like these on one of the free personality quizzes floating around Facebook, you’ll have learned what’s known as your Ocean score: How you rate according to the big five psychological traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. You may also be responsible the next time America is shocked by an election upset.","For several years, a data firm eventually hired by the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica, has been using Facebook as a tool to build psychological profiles that represent some 230 million adult Americans. A spinoff of a British consulting company and sometime-defense contractor known for its counterterrorism “psy ops” work in Afghanistan, the firm does so by seeding the social network with personality quizzes. Respondents — by now hundreds of thousands of us, mostly female and mostly young but enough male and older for the firm to make inferences about others with similar behaviors and demographics — get a free look at their Ocean scores. Cambridge Analytica also gets a look at their scores and, thanks to Facebook, gains access to their profiles and real names.","Cambridge Analytica worked on the “Leave” side of the Brexit campaign. In the United States it takes only Republicans as clients: Senator Ted Cruz in the primaries, Mr. Trump in the general election. Cambridge is reportedly backed by Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire and a major Republican donor; a key board member is Stephen K. Bannon, the head of Breitbart News who became Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman and is set to be his chief strategist in the White House.","In the age of Facebook, it has become far easier for campaigners or marketers to combine our online personas with our offline selves, a process that was once controversial but is now so commonplace that there’s a term for it, “onboarding.” Cambridge Analytica says it has as many as 3,000 to 5,000 data points on each of us, be it voting histories or full-spectrum demographics — age, income, debt, hobbies, criminal histories, purchase histories, religious leanings, health concerns, gun ownership, car ownership, homeownership — from consumer-data giants.","No data point is very informative on its own, but profiling voters, says Cambridge Analytica, is like baking a cake. “It’s the sum of the ingredients,” its chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, told NBC News. Because the United States lacks European-style restrictions on second- or thirdhand use of our data, and because our freedom-of-information laws give data brokers broad access to the intimate records kept by local and state governments, our lives are open books even without social media or personality quizzes.","Ever since the advertising executive Lester Wunderman coined the term “direct marketing” in 1961, the ability to target specific consumers with ads — rather than blanketing the airwaves with mass appeals and hoping the right people will hear them — has been the marketer’s holy grail. What’s new is the efficiency with which individually tailored digital ads can be tested and matched to our personalities. Facebook is the microtargeter’s ultimate weapon.","The explosive growth of Facebook’s ad business has been overshadowed by its increasing role in how we get our news, real or fake. In July, the social network posted record earnings: quarterly sales were up 59 percent from the previous year, and profits almost tripled to $2.06 billion. While active users of Facebook — now 1.71 billion monthly active users — were up 15 percent, the real story was how much each individual user was worth. The company makes $3.82 a year from each global user, up from $2.76 a year ago, and an average of $14.34 per user in the United States, up from $9.30 a year ago. Much of this growth comes from the fact that advertisers not only have an enormous audience in Facebook but an audience they can slice into the tranches they hope to reach.","One recent advertising product on Facebook is the so-called “dark post”: A newsfeed message seen by no one aside from the users being targeted. With the help of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Trump’s digital team used dark posts to serve different ads to different potential voters, aiming to push the exact right buttons for the exact right people at the exact right times.","Imagine the full capability of this kind of “psychographic” advertising. In future Republican campaigns, a pro-gun voter whose Ocean score ranks him high on neuroticism could see storm clouds and a threat: The Democrat wants to take his guns away. A separate pro-gun voter deemed agreeable and introverted might see an ad emphasizing tradition and community values, a father and son hunting together.","In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote. According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign sent ads reminding certain selected black voters of Hillary Clinton’s infamous “super predator” line. It targeted Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood with messages about the Clinton Foundation’s troubles in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Federal Election Commission rules are unclear when it comes to Facebook posts, but even if they do apply and the facts are skewed and the dog whistles loud, the already weakening power of social opprobrium is gone when no one else sees the ad you see — and no one else sees “I’m Donald Trump, and I approved this message.”","While Hillary Clinton spent more than $140 million on television spots, old-media experts scoffed at Trump’s lack of old-media ad buys. Instead, his campaign pumped its money into digital, especially Facebook. One day in August, it flooded the social network with 100,000 ad variations, so-called A/B testing on a biblical scale, surely more ads than could easily be vetted by human eyes for compliance with Facebook’s “community standards.”","Perhaps out of necessity, the Trump team was embracing a new-media lesson: It didn’t have to build everything from scratch. Mark Zuckerberg and others had already built the infrastructure the campaign needed to reach voters directly. When “Trump TV” went live on Facebook before and after the second debate it raked in $9 million in donations in 120 minutes.","In the immediate wake of Mr. Trump’s surprise election, so many polls and experts were so wrong that it became fashionable to declare that big data was dead. But it isn’t, not when its most obvious avatar, Facebook, was so crucial to victory.","On Monday, after a similar announcement from Google, Facebook said it would no longer allow fake-news websites to show ads, on their own sites, from Facebook’s ad network — a half-step that neither blocks what appears on your newsfeed nor affects how advertisers can microtarget users on the social network.","There are surely more changes to come. Mr. Zuckerberg is young, still skeptical that his radiant transparency machine could be anything but a force for good, rightly wary of policing what the world’s diverse citizens say and share on his network, so far mostly dismissive of Facebook’s role in the election. If Mr. Zuckerberg takes seriously his oft-stated commitments to diversity and openness, he must grapple honestly with the fact that Facebook is no longer just a social network. It’s an advertising medium that’s now dangerously easy to weaponize.","A Trump administration is unlikely to enforce transparency about who is targeted by dark posts and other hidden political ads — or to ensure that politicians take meaningful ownership of what the ads say. But Facebook can.","McKenzie Funk, an Open Society fellow, is a founding member of the journalism cooperative Deca and the author of “Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR5 of the New York edition with the headline: The Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz.

Political parties assume that data protection is taken care of when they use professionals to develop the app. Nobody intentionally chooses a path which may not respect data privacy. If any such event happens it is only due to unfamiliarity the team may have about this sensitive subject,” Mahesh explained.","Mahesh is also founder and managing director of OneIndia, which provides content in regional languages.","A comprehensive data protection law that establishes a regulator to monitor compliance with the law is an urgent necessity, said Apar Gupta, a Delhi-based lawyer who was part of Save The Internet, a group of individuals and non-government organisations fighting to preserve net neutrality.","“Regulation should also be considered for political parties given that they have become large users of social media and maintain vast records of private information,” he added.","Experts said the recent uproars illustrated the need for users to be periodically updated about the privacy policy of app operators they use.","“Personal data, while primarily an individual concern, when gathered about large groups such as the citizens of a country, can lead to national security concerns. This is especially true for online platforms which allow advertising for political targeting,” added Gupta.","Mobile internet users in India spend 70% of their time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps, according to the latest media and entertainment industry report by lobby group Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and EY, the consulting firm previously known as Ernst and Young.","Of the total time spent by a mobile internet user, on average 40% is spent on social media and communication, 30% on entertainment and 30% on other categories like gaming, news and e-commerce, the report aid.","Companies like Facebook and Google now boast a forceful combination of both social data and payments data to build on their profiles of the Indian user. Since their business model works on monitoring user data for up-selling, they should either be regulated or they definitely shouldn’t be allowed payment gateways, said a senior executive at a leading payments platform on condition of anonymity.","All payment entities, be it e-wallets or banks, are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India , except for WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, and Tez (Hindi for fast), Google’s payment app, said the person cited above.","“These firms act like a third party that uses the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) capabilities of a bank and piggyback on their license; therefore they are not regulated by the RBI or its affiliate bodies.”","Facebook India declined a specific comment on a query from Hindustan Times. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the social network, shared his take on regulating the platform in an interview to American news network CNN on 21 March.","“I actually am not sure we shouldn’t be regulated. I think in general technology is an increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than “Yes or no, should it be regulated?”","He added: “If you look at how much regulation there is around advertising on TV and print, it’s just not clear why there should be less on the internet…but we’re committed and we’ve actually already started rolling out ad transparency tools that accomplish most of the things … that people are talking about today because this is an important thing.”","Google, Facebook’s primary rival for advertising revenue, said that over the years, the company had built and introduced powerful, easy-to-use tools that enable users to adjust their privacy preferences anytime.","The search giant noted that it had introduced features like My Account to give users quick access to the settings and tools that help them safeguard their data, protect their privacy, and decide what information is used to make Google services work better for them.","The company also has a tool called Privacy Checkup to help users control their data across Google and update the personal information they wish to share and make public.","“Since we’ve introduced these tools, tens of millions of Google users around the world have used it to help suit their privacy preferences.

It may be in preparation for possibly deleting their accounts, or they just want to know what kind of data Facebook has on them.","Some owners of smartphones and tablets that use Google's Android operating system have been getting a surprise. It seems that, under certain circumstances, Facebook is logging text messages and voice phone calls.","Both The Verge and Ars Technica are reporting on this. One thing is clear from both: this only affects Android users. Those who use Apple's iOS operating system are not seeing the data in their downloads.","Download your Facebook account .zip off their site, unzip it, then go to the HTML folder, open the contact_info.htm file. See records of who you've talked to on your cell—not with the app, just on your regular cellphone—and for how long. https://t.co/l9BDEJu3Hx","Not every user of Android smartphones is seeing this, however. Some think it may be related to using Facebook Messenger as the default SMS app, though McKay pointed out he doesn't do that.","Sean Gallgher of Ars appears to have figured out it. It depends on what kind of permissions you granted on older versions of Android in the past. Those will carry over into future versions unless you changed them.","If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. But Android applications could bypass this change if they were written to earlier versions of the API, so Facebook API could continue to gain access to call and SMS data by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Google deprecated version 4.0 of the Android API in October 2017—the point at which the latest call metadata in Facebook users' data was found. Apple iOS has never allowed silent access to call data.","Facebook has issued a statement regarding the collection of the call and SMS data to both sites, saying it's part of system for finding people you know on the social network:","\"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","This will only add fuel to the fire over Facebook's collection and handling of user data. It makes sense to upload contact lists for this purpose, though why Facebook would need to know when and how you communicate with those contacts is not clear.","more techburger","This discovery also begs the question: Are other apps doing this? Android allows this level of data gathering, so it's possible Facebook is not alone.","Facebook could fix this by shutting off this kind of logging in its app, but it would be up to Google to shut it down for Android as a whole. Of course, since there are so many Android devices out there running old versions of the operating system, a fix would only be available to owners of newer phones.","If you want to download your user data, you'll find a link to do at the bottom of Facebook's general Settings page. You can find more details in my story about how to tighten Facebook's privacy controls or deactivate/delete your account.","McKay, by the way, has posted a Google Docs survey for those who have downloaded their Facebook data to report what they found.

Ted Cruz insisted Tuesday that he was unaware of any impropriety.","The Cruz presidential campaign touted its collaboration with Cambridge Analytica as a sign of a cutting edge run for the White House, allowing the Texan to carefully identify likely supporters. The firm shifted allegiance to Donald Trump once the Texan dropped out of the GOP primaries.","Both campaigns pumped millions into the company, controlled by billionaire Robert Mercer — a key patron first of Cruz and then Trump in 2016.","\"They assured us the claims made in the press were false,\" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Tuesday.","She said the campaign's contract with the firm included explicit assurances \"that all data used by them were obtained legally, that they would conduct their operations 'in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,' and that they 'hold all necessary permits, licenses and consents to conduct its operations.' The campaign relied upon those representations.\"","And she said, Cambridge Analytica reiterated those assurances after the reports in late 2015. Critics of the firm, including whistleblower Christopher Wylie, a data scientist who worked for Cambridge Analytica, have long questioned the firm's methods.","\"It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with the psychology of an entire country ... in the context of the democratic process,\" Wylie told The Guardian. \"It is a full service propaganda machine.\"","Texas Democrats blasted Cruz on Monday for benefiting from a \"massive invasion of privacy\" and demanded that Cruz explain when he knew the company had engaged in \"deceitful activity.\"","\"Ted Cruz will stop at nothing to weasel his way into power, even if it means weaponizing stolen information to manipulate people to like him,\" Texas Democratic Party deputy executive director Manny Garcia said in a news release. \"Cruz's campaign exploited personal information to create psychological profiles on millions of Americans. All to keep lining the pockets of Cruz's billionaire super PAC donors — like Robert Mercer, who funded this propaganda machine.\"","Frazier declined a request for comment Monday. On Tuesday, she said in a written statement: \"The campaign hired Cambridge Analytica as a vendor to assist with data analysis and online advertising. The campaign's data analysis program followed and built upon the successful data-modeling and micro-targeting approach pioneered by the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012.\"","Cruz faces a Senate challenge in the fall from Rep. Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso Democrat. Federal campaign records show no sign of Cruz campaign ties with Cambridge Analytica since mid-2016.","Questions about the firm","In July 2015, Rick Tyler, then a spokesman for Cruz, said the campaign used the data to identify potential voters by six personality types. He hailed the Cambridge data as \"better than anything I've ever seen.\"","\"This allows us to go into Iowa and match those traits with likely caucusgoers,\" he told Politico, referring to the February contest that Cruz ended up winning.","As questions ramped up about the Mercers' involvement with Cambridge in the following months, Tyler said he didn't \"know all the details of ownership,\" according to an October 2015 interview with The Washington Post.","Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica on Saturday. The personal data at issue was harvested by an academic researcher who then provided it to the firm in violation of Facebook's terms of service. Facebook says that in 2015, it learned that a University of Cambridge psychology professor, Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, had passed data from an app to Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL.","About 270,000 people had downloaded an app Kogan had developed, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" which \"offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\" Unknown to those users, Kogan was also able to harvest data on their friend networks.","Cruz campaign","The Cruz campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5.8 million between July 2015 and June 2016 for services that included \"voter ID targeting,\" \"voter modeling\" and \"survey research/donor modeling,\" according to the campaign's FEC reports.","The last payment was made a month after he suspended his campaign on May 3.","Cruz's leadership PAC, the Jobs Growth and Freedom Fund, paid the firm $133,000 more in October 2014, for a total of $5.94 million.","Conservative donor Rebekah Mercer pictured at the Media Research Center's 2015 annual gala, held at the National Building Museum in Washington.","(The Media Research Center)","Billionaires Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah attend the 12th International Conference on Climate Change hosted by The Heartland Institute on March 23, 2017, in Washington.\n(Photo by Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)","The Mercers pumped about $13.5 million into the pro-Cruz super PAC.","With Cruz out of the race, the Mercers shifted their support to Trump, and payments from his campaign to Cambridge Analytica began in July 2016 — $5.9 million for \"data management\" between then and December 2016.","The total is $7.4 million including payments from \"Make America Number 1,\" a Super PAC funded mostly by Trump's largest donor, Mercer, and controlled by his daughter, Rebekah Mercer.","First questions","In December 2015 — six weeks before the first voting of the presidential cycle in the Iowa caucuses — The Guardian raised questions about Cambridge Analytica's methods, reporting that:","Ted Cruz's presidential campaign is using psychological data based on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission, to boost his surging White House run and gain an edge over Donald Trump and other Republican rivals, the Guardian can reveal.\"","A little-known data company, now embedded within Cruz's campaign and indirectly financed by his primary billionaire benefactor, paid researchers at Cambridge University to gather detailed psychological profiles about the US electorate using a massive pool of mainly unwitting US Facebook users built with an online survey.","In that same story, Tyler denied anything unethical, telling The Guardian: \"My understanding is all the information is acquired legally and ethically with the permission of the users when they sign up to Facebook.\"","Jeff Roe, Cruz's campaign manager, told ThePost that the heavy reliance on data and analysis had rewritten the playbook for campaigns, making such tools as ads and polling less relevant.","\"The conventional wisdom has been destroyed. What you can do is rely on data,\" Roe said.","He didn't respond to an interview request on Monday.","At the time, the Cruz campaign had spent just $750,000 with Cambridge Analytica, and the firm reportedly had staffers embedded at the Cruz campaign's headquarters in Houston.","As the Post reported: To develop its psychographic models, Cambridge surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored individuals using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. A top Cambridge official didn't respond to a request for comment, but Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said.","The Cruz campaign modified the Cambridge template, renaming some psychological categories and adding subcategories to the list, such as \"stoic traditionalist\" and \"true believer.\" The campaign then did its own field surveys in battleground states to develop a more precise predictive model based on issues preferences.","The Cruz algorithm was then applied to what the campaign calls an \"enhanced voter file,\" which can contain as many as 50,000 data points gathered from voting records, popular websites and consumer information such as magazine subscriptions, car ownership and preferences for food and clothing.","Ending the relationship","It's unclear when Cruz stopped working with Cambridge Analytica.","Some news accounts indicate that his campaign stopped using the firm's data after the South Carolina primary in late February 2016, though federal campaign records show more than $670,000 in payments to the firm for \"media/voter modeling\" or \"voter ID targeting/web service\" in March and June, plus $218,000 for \"media\" and \"digital service/web service.\"","In March 2017 — long after Cruz ended his presidential bid — Tyler said Cambridge data had proven unreliable. The Times reported that \"in one early test, more than half the Oklahoma voters whom Cambridge had identified as Cruz supporters actually favored other candidates.\"","It also is possible that the intense profiling of individual voters became less relevant or feasible once the contest expanded beyond the small states where retail-style campaigning is paramount — Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2DDfRMJ?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.eff8a7307bca","title":"Facebook may have violated FTC privacy deal, say former federal officials, triggering risk of massive fines - The Washington Post","text":["Two former federal officials who crafted the landmark consent decree governing how Facebook handles user privacy say the company may have violated that decree when it shared information from tens of millions of users with a data analysis firm that later worked for President Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Such a violation, if eventually confirmed by the Federal Trade Commission, could lead to many millions of dollars in fines against Facebook, said David Vladeck, who as the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the subsequent consent decree resolving the case in 2011. He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

He complained so much about their picture-posting habit that they unfriended him.","“They say, What’s the harm? Well, when you turn on location there are certain elements of privacy you give up. Maybe it’s not a big deal, but it’s a certain amount of privacy,” Chen said in a wide-ranging interview in Ottawa in March.","Chen, 62, might sound like a typical paranoid dad worried his three millennial daughters’ vacation pictures could alert thieves to their empty homes. But he’s banking on his belief in the importance of privacy and security. After all, BlackBerry’s future depends on his ability to sell its products as the go-to digital security guard for everything from mobile phones to connected cars.","Many thought the Waterloo, Ont.-based company was a writeoff when Chen grabbed the wheel in November 2013, but he has salvaged its software business even as its hardware business crashed under competition from Apple Inc. and Samsung.","Despite the soft spot employees held for the iconic BlackBerry devices with their beloved keypads, Chen zeroed in on its software services, QNX division and thousands of patents as future growth drivers.","Four years into a job that was supposed to be temporary, Chen’s strategy is starting to gain traction. BlackBerry is a fraction of its former size, down to US$932 million in revenue and about 4,000 employees in fiscal 2018 from US$20 billion and 17,000 employees at its peak in 2011.","But BlackBerry’s stock price has doubled since Chen took over. It has landed partnerships for QNX software with major carmakers such as Ford Motor Co. and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC and suppliers like Denso Corp. and Delphi Technologies. On the software side, it has partnered with Microsoft Corp. and won clients such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and U.S. Air Force.","Now, Chen needs to speed up revenue growth to prove he turned the right way when he ditched smartphones to sell software.","His big bet is on the ability to secure devices, whether it’s a mobile phone, surgical equipment or a self-driving car. He believes “securing endpoints” will enable BlackBerry to leapfrog ahead of its competitors in the Internet of Things age.","“I’ve been wrong, but this feels right,” Chen said.","If he’s right, BlackBerry could be his second successful turnaround.","Chen’s first turnaround is what got him the job at BlackBerry in the first place. After management stints at Pyramid Technology Inc. and Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG, his first shot at being chief executive was at database maker Sybase in 1998.","Berkeley, Calif.-based Sybase was in rough shape back then. In a tale that will sound familiar to BlackBerry investors, Sybase’s stock and reputation had plummeted after a bad product update helped competitors get far ahead and stay there.","To fix the mess, Chen slashed payroll and costs, hired a new executive team and focused on niche markets such as mobility at a time when cellphones couldn’t even send email (BlackBerry would introduce that capability the following year).","People laughed at him, he told the New York Times in 2006, and called wireless a money-losing dream. But his rescue mission worked. He stayed at the helm until 2010 when German giant SAP SE acquired Sybase for US$5.8 billion, more than six times the value of the company when he took charge 12 years prior.","Chen seems to be applying similar tactics in writing BlackBerry’s redemption story. When it comes to bets on the future, he said he likes to “get to the puck before the puck gets there.”","It’s a charming if slightly clumsy Canadian metaphor for a businessman raised in Hong Kong and educated in the U.S., where he saw his first hockey game while studying for his electrical engineering degree at Brown University. (He got his master’s degree in the same field at the California Institute of Technology.)","BlackBerry investors seem to like what they have seen recently from a series of stock price spikes over the past year. Some analysts predict a return to glory, albeit a muted one compared to the company’s former kingpin status.","Phil Hochmuth, director of enterprise mobility at International Data Corp. Ltd., said Chen, , after a painful restructuring period, has focused on what BlackBerry does well, such as over-the-air software updates.","“Everyone saw it coming for a long time, but everyone was wondering when BlackBerry would stop making BlackBerrys,” he said. “Overall, he’s done pretty well in doing the hard part.”","But software is a completely different market than hardware, Hochmuth said, pointing out that BlackBerry’s challenge now is in competing against the likes of IBM and VMware Inc., which have huge portfolios of software to bundle, cross-sell or give away.","Investors also expect BlackBerry will go on a spending spree given it is now armed with a stack of cash, due in part to a $1-billion award from Qualcomm Inc. after an arbitrator decided it overpaid for that company’s chips.","It also sued Facebook Inc. for allegedly using proprietary messaging technology that started with BBM (BlackBerry Messenger). Chen hopes to settle.","BlackBerry CEO John Chen is reflected in a phone during an interview with the Financial Post.","But Chen expects the road to get rockier now that BlackBerry is generating cash, growing its software business and winning customers. After all, it’s not hard to convince people to try a new direction when they know the status quo isn’t working, he said. “Now, it’s different. Now we have something to protect.”","How much risk to take on to chase that better future or exactly what that future looks like then become the primary questions.","Given the similarities between Chen’s tenure at Sybase and BlackBerry thus far — including the departure of most key executives, resulting in a leadership team entirely based in California and Texas — analysts have wondered whether Chen is priming it for a takeover.","He insists that’s not the case, though he said if someone wants to “handsomely reward” his shareholders, “I have to at least consider it.”","For now, Chen plans to stick around as he signed a five-year contract in March likely worth at least US$130 million.","On top of his annual salary and bonus of US$1 million and US$2 million, respectively, he’ll get 10 million restricted share units: half will vest annually, and half will vest if the stock hits targets between US$16 and US$20. If the stock hits US$30, he’ll get a cash bonus, the exact amount to be revealed in the management information circular in May.","It’s a tempting package, even for someone who didn’t plan on becoming the face of BlackBerry.","Prem Watsa, chief executive of Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., BlackBerry’s largest shareholder, had to convince Chen to take the job after investing $1 billion in 2013 to save the ailing company.","“We continue to bet on John,” Watsa said in his annual letter to shareholders in March, citing BlackBerry’s reputation for mobile device security, automotive software and patent portfolio.","Even with Watsa’s support, Chen knew it was risky to try to turnaround BlackBerry. A wrong move could easily erase his reputation as a businessman who can reverse fortunes.","“They always remember the last thing you did … if you can’t build it, you shouldn’t destroy it,” he said.","Yet Chen likes going against conventional wisdom and, as an engineer who used to be tied to his desk to access the internet, he had a soft spot for BlackBerry.","“It’s the first one that’s able to mobilize where you work. This is a big deal. It completely changed how people work, how people communicate,” he said. “I really was trying to see whether there was any way to reinvent and save a very big icon … this is not only iconic for Canada, it’s really iconic for the industry.”","Still, Chen originally signed on as executive chairman and interim CEO, with plans to set the direction and help with strategy, not actually run the day-to-day operations.","Now that “interim” has clearly been crossed off his title, Chen, who jokes he’s “being shanghaied into this job,” keeps a primary residence in California where his wife lives, although he said he has a place in Waterloo now, too.","He remains a private man, one who would rather not pose for photos, whether they’re for his daughters’ social media accounts or a national newspaper. He’s known to be more compelling in small groups or discussions than in front of large audiences.","BlackBerry CEO John Chen during at interview with the Financial Post.","“Fortunately and unfortunately, I became the face of the company,” he said.","Initially, though, Chen was anxious about the big decisions, most notably the one to abandon BlackBerry’s roots as a smartphone maker. The math showed him BlackBerry couldn’t afford to continue the way it had since it was no longer a market leader, but it was emotional for employees and investors alike to shift from the device that put Waterloo on the map. Chen had to go with his gut.","“After the initial first year, I was never doubtful that this company would survive,” he said.","These days, his role involves travelling around the world to convince powerful customers they need BlackBerry’s software to protect their business, be they governments or corporations. A lot of them still think BlackBerry is a cellphone provider, Chen said, so he wants to get the comeback story out.","This evolution is something BlackBerry has struggled with since it moved from producing a consumer device that everyone understood and wanted to use — including famous brand evangelists Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Kim Kardashian — to selling business software with a jargon-heavy sales pitch.","But a sales job isn’t what brings him to Ottawa in mid-March. He’s there to convince the federal government to set national standards for automated vehicles, one of BlackBerry’s major business categories in its post-smartphone phase. His visit comes a few days after a self-driving vehicle owned by Uber Technologies Inc. killed a pedestrian in Arizona.","The “unfortunate tragedy” reveals two things, he said: one, the industry needs to step up when it comes to predictability and safety overrides to avoid test runs turning into mere marketing ploys; two, Ottawa needs to set regulations as soon as possible.","“It’s like drunk driving,” Chen said, pointing to the government’s limit on blood alcohol content. “The government needs to take a strong role in defining what is the minimum level of security that an autonomous platform needs to demonstrate before it’s even allowed to be put on the road.”","Private parties should participate in writing the rules, he said, but he’s calling for a minimum national standard to apply to every manufacturer and component provider.","That’s where QNX comes in. QNX only makes up a fifth of BlackBerry’s business — its enterprise software services pull in more than 40 per cent of overall revenue — but the division is expected to grow after design wins that should, if the puck goes where Chen anticipates, generate revenue as cars become more automated over the next five years. He doesn’t want delays in regulations to slow the industry down.","Meanwhile, the recent Uber and Facebook incidents, along with the U.S. government heightened focus on cybersecurity, have thrust safety and security into the spotlight. For Chen, that’s free marketing.","“It’s kind of like when there’s a drought everyone wants water. I provide water,” he said. “The more it is debated, the more awareness it brings, the better off for BlackBerry.”","Chen insists BlackBerry never has and never will monetize the data it transmits and secures, such as emails or a connected car’s activities — it doesn’t even keep copies. That’s not his strategy, merely a continuation of the way the company has always operated.","“We suffered through the period when everybody was monetizing people’s data,” he said. “They provide everything to you for free. I can’t provide everything to you for free, because I actually don’t sell the stuff you gave me.”","This particular strategy is a big reason why BlackBerry is popular with banks and governments, including in the U.S., which has tightened its borders under the Donald Trump administration (Chen played golf with Trump, once, decades ago).","The average person may not understand the cryptography that Chen said makes BlackBerry’s services secure, but he’s not about to spell it out to anyone for proprietary and safety reasons. But he’ll continue to focus on securing endpoints — after all, that’s where he thinks the puck is going."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25.","The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights.","European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,'' said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.''","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,'' allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,'' said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","The legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.'' The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover _ whichever is greater _ for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off'' European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds-barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,'' she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. ``We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,'' it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,'' he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,'' he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.''","Dual/Multi factor authentication is an essential method to add another layer of security for authenticating the identity where the user not only authenticates through the credentials (username/password) but also through a secret code."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

In the wake of the scandal over Facebook's privacy practices, users have become newly interested in the data that Facebook collects and retains about them. But while the social network makes it fairly simple to download everything it knows about you, it doesn't provide a roadmap for how to parse that data or figure out what it means.","Facebook announced Wednesday, however, that in the coming weeks, it will expand the data it allows you to download to include likes, reactions, search history, and location history. The social network also plans to add an option for users to transfer the data to another service if they want. Part of the rollout includes a new tool called Access Your Information, which allows users to more easily view and delete old posts, reactions, comments, and search history.","For now though, your Facebook data is still likely filled of surprises.

Depending on how much content you've posted to Facebook—including photos, videos, text posts, and other forms of media—it might take some time for the file to be prepared.","I've been on Facebook for over a decade, and my 277.2 MB file was ready within a half hour. But I also haven't uploaded many photos or videos to the site. Once you have the file, you can download it as a folder to your desktop. Mine was labeled \"facebook-louisematsakis.\"","The first piece of information you will want to look at is a file labeled index.htm. Clicking on this file will open a tab within your browser, with a menu of options on the left-hand side. Under Profile, you'll find a list of basic information the site has about you, like the exact time you signed up for Facebook, the contact information you've provided, as well as any work or education history.","One surprising piece of information on this screen: Facebook keeps a list of everyone you've previously said you were in a relationship with. For me, this includes a bunch of my friends, because back in middle and high school, it was cool to declare you were in a relationship with a close friend. The list only includes three people I've actually dated. The very first person on the list is, inexplicably, my own cousin (being 13 was weird, OK?).","Photos, Videos, and Friends","The Photos tab contains every photo you've ever uploaded to the site, as well as related metadata, like the IP address from which each photo was uploaded. Scroll down, and you'll find a link to the facial recognition data that Facebook retains. If you click it, you can see your Example Count, which could be the number of photos Facebook used to train a machine learning algorithm to recognize your face. My Example Count is 214. Facebook says this figure is \"a unique number based on a comparison of the photos you're tagged in. We use this data to help others tag you in photos.\"","If you want to opt-out of Facebook's facial recognition features, here’s how to do that.","One interesting note about photos: My Facebook data didn’t appear to included tagged photos of me, just photos I had uploaded myself.","The Videos tab contained dozens of clips I posted to my friends' timelines when I was a teenager. It's impressive how much you can forget what you shared over the years; I was horrified to realize that Facebook had so many grainy videos of my face at 13, 14, and 15 years old. Also fun? If you recorded a video on Facebook but never actually posted it, Facebook still has it.","In the Friends tab you'll find every single one of your Facebook friends, as well as the date that you added each other. If you unfriended someone, and then re-added them later, they'll show up on this list twice. The list also includes all of the friend requests that you have declined.","Pay special attention to the very bottom of the page, where you can see what \"Friend Peer Group\" Facebook thinks you're in. Mine says \"Starting Adult Life.\"","Advertising & Other Weird Info","The most interesting part of your index is the Ads tab. There, Facebook will show you a list of ad categories it has associated with your account. Mine include dozens of publications like Harper's and Buzzfeed, as well as vexing ones like \"Goth subculture\" and \"Middle Class.\"","I have certainly poked people on Facebook more times than this.","Below this list you'll find advertisements you've supposedly clicked on; mine has 40, dating back to January. And below that is a distressing list of advertisers Facebook says \"have your contact information.\" (Former Facebook ad executive Antonio García Martínez suggests that this means the advertisers came to Facebook with your information, not the other way around.) They may have brought this information to the social network using Facebook's custom audience tool, according to a Facebook representative. For me, this includes major corporations like Walmart, ASOS, Airbnb, and Marriott Rewards. It also includes a number of bands, the dating app Happn, which I don't recall ever using, and \"House of Blues Dallas.\" I have never been to Dallas.","One data set seems surprisingly incomplete; under Pokes I was inexplicably greeted by only two pokes, one from 2013 and another from last year. I have certainly poked people on Facebook more times than this. It's unclear why Facebook has only chosen to retain these two poking instances, though other users appear to have experienced the same oversight. Facebook didn't answer a request for comment about why it has only kept track of a select list of pokes.","The last thing to check in your index is the Applications tab, which is a list of apps you've used to sign up with using your Facebook profile.","Messages","Aside from the index, your Facebook data file should also include several other folders, labeled html, messages, photos, and videos. Mostly they repeat information that’s also included in the index. Don't skip them altogether though. In Messages > files, for instance, are all the files you've sent over Facebook Messenger, and Messages > photos contains all the images you’ve sent. Mine only appear to date back several years, likely because I used to regularly delete my Facebook messages.","Call & SMS Records","If you have an Android device, you may have given Facebook or Facebook Lite permission to access your call and text history years ago. Specifically, before Google changed how permissions worked in Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, simply allowing Facebook to access your contacts also let it grab your call and message logs.","Find out for sure by clicking the Contact Info tab. Because I've only ever used an iPhone—Apple doesn't allow apps to scrape call and text history—this tab only contained a list of my phone's contacts. If you have granted permission, this screen will also include a certified creepy list of your call and SMS history.","Get Rid of It","Now that you’ve looked through your Facebook data, here’s how to delete some of it. Keep in mind that Facebook says it plans to soon make it easier to delete data, but for now, the process is fairly cumbersome.","The first place to start is your contacts. First, head over to Facebook’s “Manage Invites and Imported Contacts” page. At the bottom of the screen, there’s an option to “Remove all contacts,” though you can also choose to manually remove specific ones. You’ll need to repeat this step for contacts you’ve uploaded through Facebook Messenger, which you can do here. Lastly, you’ll need to prevent Facebook from continuously re-uploading your contacts. You can learn how to turn off that settings here. Again, you’ll need to do it twice, once on the Facebook App and again on Messenger.","Lastly, here’s how to delete individual posts you’ve made to Facebook. Click the top right-hand options tab on desktop, and then click Activity Log. There, you’ll be able to delete any post from your history, and you can jump to specific years if you’d like to delete the oldest stuff first. If you’re interested in bulk deleting, you can use a Chrome extension like Social Book Post Manager.","If you’re not quite ready mass-remove your old posts, but want to limit who can see them, here’s a full guide to updating your Facebook’s privacy settings. Remember, though, that Facebook says it's going to re-vamp its privacy features in coming weeks—which means you get to do this all over again."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

{"originalurl":"http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBKrFLI?ocid=st","title":"Facebook’s rules for accessing user data lured more than just Cambridge Analytica","text":["Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info - now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

(Except for the movies category, which for me still displays “Roadhouse.”)","Among the items in the file are your entire timeline, which includes posts from previous iterations of Facebook, when posting on people’s walls, which comprised the bulk of a user’s interactions on the platform. (Perhaps it was not even a platform yet.)","Everything you and others posted is there, including all the things people wrote, assuming they were simply shouting into the abyss, figuring no one was listening. Facebook was, and they wrote it down!","Also present are the ad topics Facebook thinks you’d be into, the ads you’ve actually clicked on — this doesn’t seem complete, it says I clicked on only a few in just 2018 — and the advertisers that possess your data. Some of them are really weird: A friend texted me to say that “Rod Stewart” is listed under the advertisers that have his data. My editor’s archive showed that a bunch of cruise lines — and the musician Beck – had her data. (She has no idea why, and when asked whether she even likes Beck said, “I don’t know?”)","Most unnerving perhaps, are the private messages, compiled in one place. We get new phones or clear our old phone texts, but Facebook doesn’t have storage issues. It’s all here.","All of this should not be news to you. Facebook’s 3 billion users give this information willingly, and we certainly expect the company not to delete old posts. But the archive, compiled for the benefit of the user, puts the concept into alarming relief, showing exactly how much of our lives we’ve poured into it. And of course, how easy it is to condense a digital life into a .zip file.","It’s scary, but it’s not a surprise","When you post a photo on Facebook, you expect it to be available — even years later. Recently, Facebook even made a feature on this, showing friend retrospectives for friend anniversaries in your newsfeed. Similarly, the motivation for the collection of some of this data – advertising – was detailed in the fine print. Unfortunately, most don’t read the fine print and thus miss this devil in the details. (Though the fact that a 13-year-old is expected to read and understand this may trouble some.)","How Facebook can interpret all this data may be of more interest. You can see what their conclusions are if you read this article. From the data you provide as a user, what you “like” on the platform, they can get a decent picture of who you are.","Another friend and Facebook user I talked with noted that it was interesting that people seem more concerned with “psychographic data” rather than the fact that Equifax exposed 150 million Social Security numbers, something that has identity theft and financial security implications. The answer, of course, is because there’s a small-ish .zip file —mine was 34 megabytes filled with secrets. If it got loose, it would be pure KOMPROMAT. (Update your password.)","From a personal data hygiene perspective, if all this doesn’t sit well with you, the only thing you can really do is delete the contacts you may have uploaded to Facebook. Though you can make things hidden, purging the site of your data seems to mean full-scale account deletion, if you want to set fire to your old activity."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before them. Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about $50 billion in the past two days.","They are all focused on the same thing: whether Facebook mishandled users’ data.","Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users, selling advertisements based on their ages, interests and other details. But the scrutiny over the company’s vast trove of personal data — following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users — is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula.","“Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation,” said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. “The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems.”","So far, most of the social network’s top executives have been silent. Mr. Zuckerberg, its founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, his top deputy, have not made any public statements in recent days. The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park, Calif., where the company is based.","At the meeting, employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The firm, which was tied to President Trump’s 2016 campaign, used the data to target messages to voters.","The meeting, which included Facebook’s deputy counsel, Paul Grewal, largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers, according to Facebook employees in attendance.

The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, who plans to leave in August.","The pressure on Facebook has been building for years.","It started in the European Union, where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region’s 500 million people. The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.","After the 2016 presidential campaign, lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics, citing the company’s role in Russia’s disinformation efforts. The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news, and the company’s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future.","The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers. The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users.","The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.","The F.T.C. investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third-party apps on the social media site, like games, would not be allowed to access their data. But the apps, the agency found, were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user.","The current investigation has parallels. The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher, Aleksandr Kogan. Mr. Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends.

According to sources from Facebook, “the pressure from lawmakers, the media, and the public has become too intense to justify anything less” than a congressional testimony.","Zuckerberg has desperately been trying to avoid the hullabaloo surrounding Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that reportedly accessed information from about 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge. However, he told CNN last week that he’d be “happy” to testify before Congress “if it’s the right thing to do.”","Indeed, lots of people think it is the right thing to do, including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. Grassley said Monday that he’s invited Zuckerberg to testify at a data privacy hearing on April 10, along with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.","Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into the company, and attorneys representing 37 states penned a letter Monday urging Facebook to explain how Cambridge Analytica was able to get its hands on such personal data. “These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook´s policies and practices, and the processes in place to ensure they are followed,” the letter said. “We need to know that users can trust Facebook. With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Facebook’s stock has plummeted since the revelation of the scandal, and Zuckerberg has personally lost at least $10 billion.","The public definitely deserves to know the role Facebook played in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Now Canadian whistleblower Christopher Wylie is speaking out about what he knows. 4:18","The Canadian whistleblower at the centre of an international scandal that allegedly helped the Trump campaign capitalize politically from private Facebook information got his start in politics with the Liberal Party of Canada.","But several senior Liberal officials from that time, about a decade ago, insist they have almost no recollection of then-teenager Christopher Wylie — if any at all.","The New York Times and The Observer of London have reported U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign hired a data-analytics company that harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users.","Cambridge Analytica, the company named by Wylie as being behind the massive leak, exploited private social media activity to help allow the Trump campaign to better target voters by profiling their behaviour and personalities ahead of the U.S. election, according to the reports. The firm connected with Trump's political adviser Steve Bannon, whom Wylie also met, the reports said.","'I do feel responsible'","Wylie, a 28-year-old from British Columbia, is the data scientist who spoke out about the controversy. He's also the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica.","\"It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country, without their consent or awareness.\"","The reports provided many details about the whistleblower who in 2007 or 2008 landed his first political gig with the federal Liberals.","At age 17, he worked in the office of Canada's opposition leader, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stéphane Dion, said one of the reports. When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama's campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn't heard of Wylie — or they barely remembered him.","\"I vaguely recall him,\" wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. \"I think that he was a summer intern.\"","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was \"pretty junior\" and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn't know Wylie well, they remembered him as a \"big advocate of microtargeting.\"","Liberal Party insists it doesn't sell information","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama's campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ. The firm has come under scrutiny in Britain for its possible role in helping the Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum.","Asked about Wylie, Canada's Liberal Party said in a statement Sunday that protecting the information of Canadians it engages with is a \"foremost priority.\"","Christopher Wylie told CBC News that Cambridge Analytica targeted millions of Americans during the election campaign without their knowledge based on psychological profiles and surveys. (Lily Martin/CBC)","The party said it has a clear, stringent policy that protects individuals' private information. It also said its agreements with campaign partners also include strict requirements.","The party insists it doesn't sell information under any circumstances.","A spokeswoman for Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said Sunday that social media platforms have a responsibility to help ensure citizens and the democratic processes are protected from \"threats like foreign interference, data breaches, hate speech, and misinformation.\"","\"While some social media platforms have begun to take initial steps to address these issues, it's clear that much more needs to be done,\" Jordan Owens wrote in an email.","Owens said the government would work with social media firms to ensure they respect and help preserve the integrity of Canada's democracy.","Facebook said in a weekend blog post that claims the harvesting of user information was a data breach are \"completely false.\"","The statement said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his Facebook app.","\"People knowingly gave their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" said the post by Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice-president and deputy general counsel.","External Links","Popular Now","Comments","To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The latest revelations of a massive user privacy breach at Facebook have raised new questions about whether the company can and should be trusted to responsibly manage the personal data of its more than 2.1 billion users.","#DeleteFacebook began trending last week after reports that Facebook allowed the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access the personal data of as many as 50 million users. According to admissions by Cambridge Analytica, the data was used to develop psychographic profiles to help political campaigns target voters.","In the aftermath of these revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a charm offensive, speaking with reporters, apologizing for mishandling user data and promising to do better in the future.","On Sunday, Zuckerberg took out a full-page ad in multiple U.S. newspapers that read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't we don't deserve it.\"","The ad referred to the Cambridge Analytica operation and the actions of a \"university researcher,\" Aleksandr Kogan, who developed a quiz app in 2014 on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Under Facebook's policy at the time, Kogan was able to pay for a feature called \"friends permission.\" That allowed him to harvest the data of 270,000 quiz-takers, who gave explicit consent to use their data, as well as the data that could be gleaned from their friend networks.","In his ad, Zuckerberg admitted that Kogan's app was not the only one that trawled large amounts of user information. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" Zuckerberg said. He concluded, \"Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\"","Some have taken note of the CEO's apology and applauded the company for taking steps to make its data-sharing policies more transparent. Zuckerberg and other executives at Facebook have published notices explaining steps they're taking to crack down on platform abuses as well as their efforts to make privacy settings more user-friendly.","Others have pointed to the fact that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user data.","\"Facebook says we don't sell your data, but they certainly provide access to it,\" observed Michelle De Mooy, director of the privacy and data project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.","Moreover, Facebook acknowledged that it knew about Cambridge Analytica's questionable contract with Kogan in 2015. At that time, they suspended Kogan and asked him to confirm that he had deleted the user data. According to reports, that user data remained accessible to Cambridge Analytica for years.","\"Facebook has been dragged, seemingly kicking and screaming into being more transparent,\" said Dave Levine, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \"Facebook has not done nearly as much as it could, simply by way of explanation to the public about its behaviors, about how your information or posts are curated, about what kind of data it collects and how it shares it.\"","The Cambridge Analytica breach is only the latest example of the company's opacity and delayed response to public outcry. Facebook has been at the center of the fake news controversy and spreading misinformation during the 2016 election. The company has been called before Congress over their role in facilitating Russian election interference and online terrorist recruitment. And the company finally acknowledged and changed their newsfeed policy after being caught suppressing conservative content.","Each scandal has temporarily hurt Facebook, but the latest scandal over violating users' privacy could be the one that tips the scales and imposes real costs and consequences on the social media giant.","\"Ultimately the problem here is one of trust,\" explained Julian Sanchez, privacy and technology fellow at the Cato Institute. If users no longer believe the company is responsibly handling their information or feel they cannot understand the company's policies for sharing their data, Zuckerberg's apologies will be \"too little, too late,\" Sanchez noted.","\"Once that's burned, once people don't have a sense of trust, I don't know if the specific policy changes will help much,\" he continued. \"Even if they really are making genuine improvements, as it appears they are, once that trust is gone, it's hard to get back.\"","In a new poll conducted in the days after the data sharing scandal erupted, Reuters/Ipsos found that the majority of respondents do not trust Facebook to handle their data.","Facebook was deemed the least trustworthy when it came to obeying laws that protect American's personal information when compared to other companies that gather user data like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo.","\"Maybe the poll is new, but the sentiment is not,\" De Mooy explained. The reason, she said, is that social media platforms \"are designed for opacity,\" intentionally making it harder for users to understand and make informed decisions about their data.","Facebook and other companies that rely on selling access to user data have had to walk a thin line between protecting their users' data and monetizing it. Consistently over recent years, polls have shown that even as users sign up and sign away some of the rights to their data, they are wary of how that information is being used.","Periodically, this concern has translated into relatively short-lived calls for people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, but it is not clear that those efforts have caused the company to fundamentally change how it operates.","\"If a few hundred-thousand people delete their Facebook accounts that will have a marginal impact on their bottom line,\" Levine noted. \"However if there is a reputational hit at the trust level, which is what Facebook needs to maintain in order to be a viable business, that cumulatively could create problems.\"","In recent weeks, Facebook has taken a significant hit with the markets valuing the breach of privacy and trust in the tens of billions. Since the story broke earlier this month, Facebook's stock has plunged more than 15 percent in a selling spree that has cost the company over $75 billion in market value.","Facebook could also be facing even more costs as the consumer protection watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy and data use policies based on the reports about the company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","The FTC already brought charges against Facebook in 2011 for what it termed \"deceptive privacy claims.\" At the time, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC and signed a consent decree which, among other things, required the company to obtain a user's explicit consent before allowing third parties to access their data. Moreover, the agreement required Facebook to inform users if they discovered they were unable to protect their data.","\"Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here,\" former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Jessica Rich told the Washington Post last week. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties.\"","If the FTC finds Facebook in violation of the consent decree, the company could face a $40,000 fine per violation. It is not clear whether that fine would apply to the alleged 50 million users whose data was shared inappropriately with Cambridge Analytica. In a statement to the Post, a Facebook spokesperson said the company rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","De Mooy said she is encouraged by the FTC investigation, emphasizing that \"the consent decrees need to be meaningful.\" However, she worries that regulators simply lack the enforcement authority when it comes to protecting consumer data.","In the United States, consumer data is largely governed by contracts and terms of use agreements between the consumer and the company. This approach is vastly different from the European Union, which will be implementing a new regime of privacy protections, the General Data Protection Regulation, beginning in May.","The new privacy regime will directly impact U.S. tech companies that will be required to be more transparent in informing consumers about their sharing practices in order to get consent. Companies that fail to protect user data can also expect to see millions of dollars in fines.","It is yet to be seen whether U.S. lawmakers, who have traditionally taken a lax approach to regulating internet companies, will take steps to strengthen data privacy protections."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

{"originalurl":"https://www.theengineer.co.uk/anthony-finkelstein-chief-scientific-adviser/","title":"Interview: Anthony Finkelstein, chief scientific adviser for national security The Engineer","text":["The chief scientific adviser for national security is far from a Bond techie and passionate about British research","Magazines like The Engineer arrange interviews in two ways. Sometimes we contact organisations to request interviews with people who we think might be interesting, and sometimes they are pitched to us. In this case, the Royal Academy of Engineering got in touch and asked if we’d like to speak to Anthony Finkelstein. He is the chief scientific adviser for national security, we were told. “Basically, he’s like Q from the James Bond films.”","This is not the sort of introduction that one can turn down. Meeting Finkelstein in a basement conference room at the Academy’s headquarters near St James’s Park (a time-honoured rendezvous for Cold War spies, as John Le Carré told us), I wasn’t sure whether to expect the sort of bumbling-but-brilliant character portrayed by Desmond Llewelyn in the original films, the donnish-but-sarcastic type played by his successor, John Cleese, or the unassuming-but-penetrating new version of Ben Whishaw. Finkelstein resembles none of these; he is a tall, slightly gangly man with a taste for floppy caps and warm knitwear, and has a measured manner of speaking that indicates he is considering every word carefully. He is also quite adamant that he isn’t Q. When asked whether there is, in fact, a Q at all, he replied that he can neither confirm nor deny it. “But if there were one,” he added dryly, “she’d be doing a quite marvellous job.”","Finkelstein is a software systems engineer by profession, holding the chair in the discipline at UCL and based at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data sciences headquartered at the British Library. However, he added, we should not necessarily draw any inferences from that about the nature of the science he advises on. All other government departments save one have chief scientific advisers (CSAs), he explained (the Treasury has a chief economist). “We try to have a kind of mix among all the CSAs of different disciplines, so that when we have a multidisciplinary problem we can call on a range of people. We have physicists and materials scientists and people who have control and robotics experience, and a statistician, so I’m the sort of resident computer scientist.”","Finkelstein works across the range of government organisations that bear upon national security. Formally, his affiliation is to the government office for science, but he deals most often with the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office and the police. His remit covers the whole technology spectrum, but is not concerned with weaponry or what he describes as “a large defence infrastructure”.","The role of CSA is both proactive and reactive. “I run a large national security-related research programme, and I have creative input in that,” Finkelstein said. “But also people in the national security arena bring problems to me which I try to use science to address. The other people who bring me problems are our adversaries; I look very closely at what they are doing and look very closely at how any technologies provide a threat or an opportunity to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our national security.” The nature of those adversaries is as various as the technologies Finkelstein deals with. “They range from lone actors and spontaneous volatile extremists through to terrorist organisations, or ‘hostile non-state actors’ as they are sometimes called, to states which wish us and our values ill,” he explained.","Although not all of the technologies with which Finkelstein is concerned are in the digital domain, because of his background he has a particular interest in the computer science aspects of national security.","One thing that is particularly interesting to him at the moment, he said, is privacy-enhancing technologies “both for the opportunities they provide for national security to be able to maximise its function while minimising intrusion, but at the same time, I’m really interested in the exploitation of these privacy-enhancing technologies by our adversaries to hide bad stuff”.","Flexible batteries will be used to tackle adversaries at home and abroad","Some of these privacy-enhancing technologies include statistical disclosure control, which is a technique intended to ensure that when a survey or administrative data is analysed, no person or organisation can be identified from the results; privacy-preserving data mining, a related technique that tries to ensure that while knowledge can be extracted from data, that knowledge should not include information about individuals or organisations that should be kept private; and another related technology known as homomorphic encryption, which is computing unencrypted data, so inferences can be drawn without decrypting private information.","In the case of such technologies, Finkelstein’s role is to encourage research that will help provide tools for providers of critical national infrastructure to manage related data and ensure that it is kept as secure as is feasible.","“The national security community now knows we can’t do everything behind the barbed-wire fence. We are only going to be able to keep up with exponential technlogy advances and with fast-moving agile adversaries if we exploit the full value of the innovation community and of the open science and technology community”","One thing Finkelstein is particularly keen to stress is that even when security structures seem to be crude, the science that goes into constructing them or optimising them is often considerable. The most visible pieces of the security apparatus that the general public see are probably bollards and barriers protecting sensitive buildings or places where crowds gather. “Designing a really good bollard is extremely difficult because the more deeply you embed it the more expensive it is, and you have to withstand all sorts of force,” Finkelstein insisted. “Actually, vehicle mitigation is really difficult, complex and quite hi-tech. The point is, you always want to use technology appropriately for the challenge you are facing, and that isn’t always the most elaborate solution. It’s the best solution to meet the requirements.”","Another part of security procedures that many people know about is the use of spotters surveying crowds in airports or sometimes in video feeds to identify patterns of suspicious behaviour. “There is an astonishingly complicated bit of behavioural science research that’s gone on in order to underpin changing the way we do things in public spaces. It may appear crude but if it does that belies the fact that it is based on a lot of very serious behavioural sciences.”","As part of ongoing efforts to develop technology in the national security sector, Finkelstein and the Royal Academy of Engineering have launched a post-doc programme to help identify exciting and important research that might make a contribution to the UK’s national security and that of our allies. “We are also interested in developing the UK capability in many of these areas of science and engineering. We want to encourage work on topics which are likely to make us safer, while developing the tech ecosystem around networks to our collective benefit.”","Partly inspired by a similar successful scheme in the US, this programme is a response to a problem which will be familiar to many in the industrial R&D community. “Things have changed, technologies are a lot easier to access and the global science base is a click away, so the government is very conscious that science is globalised, and there is a whole range of states that now have advanced science and are moving at our rate if not faster. The national security community now knows we can’t do everything behind the barbed-wire fence. We are only going to be able to keep up with exponential technlogy advances and with fast-moving agile adversaries if we exploit the full value of the innovation community and of the open science and technology community. It’s difficult and counter-cultural for us to achieve that openness – we prefer in general not to tell people about our capabilities or our lack of capabilities, but on the other hand the brightest people don’t necessarily work for you, so we have to reach out.”","Visit the UK’s dedicated jobsite for engineering professionals. Each month, we’ll bring you hundreds of the latest roles from across the industry.","“The national security community now knows we can’t do everything behind the barbed-wire fence. We are only going to be able to keep up with exponential technlogy advances and with fast-moving agile adversaries if we exploit the full value of the innovation community and of the open science and technology community”: Once-upon-a-time we did a great deal more via our deflab network of which ARE-DRA-DERA delivered deals on ticket price for Trident via transatlantic treatied trust sustained since WW2 but cavalierly killed for commercial kickback in profiteered piratisation.","I recall attending a conference [Society for Long Range Planning] at RMC Shrivenham in 1971: we were invited to imagine we were thirty years hence (2001) and then look backwards to the then present.

Adams, chairman of the humanities endowment, in a statement.","Mr. Adams made a point of noting endowment support for preservationist work in Kentucky, the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and for theater work by veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — a clear overture to Republicans to remember that endowment grants do not only go to liberal elites.","At an impromptu meeting at the arts endowment Wednesday, the chairwoman, Jane Chu, broke the news to the staff and said they would conduct business as usual as the budget-writing process unfolds in Congress, according to three federal officials with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversation. Ms. Chu said she called the meeting because she did not want the staff to learn about the proposals from media reports.","Staff members reacted in a professional manner, with a mixture of sadness and some surprise but no visible anger, one of the officials said. Talking points were given to the staff to handle phone calls from endowment grant recipients concerned about their money and the fate of the agencies.","In recent weeks, officials at both endowments were hopeful that President Trump would not propose draconian cuts, let alone elimination. One of the Trump administration’s liaisons to the arts endowment, Mary Anne Carter, had told officials that she was an advocate for the arts and that she wouldn’t have accepted the position if the endowment was going to be eliminated, according to an endowment official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations with Ms. Carter. (She declined to comment on Wednesday.)","Arts groups have already begun a furious lobbying campaign to press Republicans in Congress to save the endowments. The House will draft a budget in the coming months, and arts groups have already been focusing its lobbying efforts there. The Association of Art Museum Directors issued one of the first statements denouncing the president’s plan and urging Congress to save the endowments.","“I’m sort of dumbstruck,” said Brian Ferriso, the association’s president. “I’m hopeful that Congress will take the time to say, ‘Hey, wait a second. We need these cultural elements to our society.’”","Alexandra Nicholis Coon, the executive director of the Massillon Museum in Ohio, said her staff was relying on money from the humanities endowment for a project to record stories, scan letters, and photograph the uniforms of American soldiers who died in World War I. She criticized Mr. Trump’s opposition to the endowments as “shortsighted.”","“It’s disheartening to know that our president and the administration values community memory and the preservation of the American story so little,” said Ms. Coon, whose museum is in Stark County, where Mr. Trump trounced Hillary Clinton in the November election.","While some Republicans have voiced support for the endowments, the arts endowment in particular has been a target of conservatives for decades.","After political battles over the endowments in the late 1980s and 1990s, both agencies created programs and provided grants to more artists and scholars in politically conservative parts of the country, like a rural arts initiative that benefited states like Alabama and North Dakota. Yet endowment money still flowed strongly to liberal-leaning states and cities: New York City arts groups are the largest recipient of federal arts grants.","Some advocates for the arts endowment, which doles out far less money as a percentage than many other governments around the world, have said that its importance is less about the money and more about the message that it sends about the importance of culture in the United States.","PEN America, an advocacy group made up of literary figures, has been circulating a petition in an effort to save the endowments that has already amassed 200,000 signatures, including prominent names such as Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood.","Or, as Teresa Eyring of the Theatre Communications Group put it, the time has come for “action mode.”","“This is the beginning of a long road,” said Ms. Eyring, executive director of the group, which represents more than 500 nonprofit theaters around the country. “Now advocates and people in the arts community will communicate with their legislators and really try to make clear the value of this relatively modest but very important investment in our country through the arts.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: The Arts and Humanities; Call for Elimination Sets Off a Struggle.

But apparently, when you’re trying to win a campaign, prostitutes, bribes and spies work pretty well too.","On Monday, Britain’s Channel 4 News ran an explosive exposé of the embattled company. Going undercover as a potential client, its reporter filmed Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, talking about entrapping his clients’ opponents by sending “very beautiful” Ukranian sex workers to their homes. He spoke of offering bribes to candidates while secretly filming them and putting the footage online, of employing fake IDs and bogus websites. Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, described how the company “put information into the bloodstream of the internet” and then watched it spread.","This story came two days after a joint investigation by The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from over 50 million Facebook users without their permission. That, The Times wrote, “allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.”","After days of revelations, there’s still a lot we don’t know about Cambridge Analytica. But we’ve learned that an operation at the heart of Trump’s campaign was ethically nihilistic and quite possibly criminal in ways that even its harshest critics hadn’t suspected. That’s useful information. In weighing the credibility of various accusations made against the president, it’s good to know the depths to which the people around him are willing to sink.","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of the SCL Group, a British company that specialized in disinformation campaigns in the developing world. It’s mostly owned by the Mercer family, billionaire right-wing donors and strong Trump supporters. Before becoming the Trump campaign’s chief executive, Steve Bannon was Cambridge Analytica’s vice president. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., also served as an adviser to the company.","Cambridge Analytica shared office space with Trump’s San Antonio-based digital operation, and took substantial credit for its success. “We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communications played such an integral part in President-elect Donald Trump’s extraordinary win,” Nix said in a Nov. 9, 2016, news release.","It’s long been hard to judge how well psychographic profiling actually works. Many consider Cambridge Analytica overrated. Last year, BuzzFeed News reported that former employees said “that despite its sales pitch and public statements, it never provided any proof that the technique was effective or that the company had the ability to execute it on a large scale.” Those who feared that Cambridge Analytica was conducting information warfare on the American people may have been giving the company’s self-serving propaganda too much credence.","But whether or not Cambridge Analytica’s methodology works, the fact that the Trump campaign had a crew of high-tech dirty tricksters on its payroll is significant. We already know that Cambridge Analytica reached out to Julian Assange about finding and disseminating Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails. We know that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has asked the company to turn over documents related to the Trump campaign. Channel Four News plans to air additional undercover footage about Cambridge Analytica’s role in the Trump campaign on Tuesday.","At a minimum, we’ve learned that the Trump campaign’s vaunted social media program was built on deception. Shortly after the 2016 election, Forbes ran an article crediting Jared Kushner for his father-in-law’s shocking triumph. Thanks to digital tools, it said, the traditional presidential campaign was dead, “and Kushner, more than anyone not named Donald Trump, killed it.”","For those who knew something of Kushner’s pre-election career, this portrait of him as some sort of analytics genius was befuddling. The small, gossipy New York newspaper he’d owned, The New York Observer, didn’t even have a particularly good website. “He wasn’t tech-savvy at all,” Elizabeth Spiers, the paper’s former editor in chief, told me.","Cambridge Analytica’s corruption helps provide the missing piece in this story. If the Trump campaign had a social media advantage, one reason is that it hired a company that mined vast amounts of illicitly obtained data.","There’s a lesson here for our understanding of the Trump presidency. Trump and his lackeys have been waging their own sort of psychological warfare on the American majority that abhors them. On the one hand, they act like idiots. On the other, they won, which makes it seem as if they must possess some sort of occult genius. With each day, however, it’s clearer that the secret of Trump’s success is cheating. He, and those around him, don’t have to be better than their opponents because they’re willing to be so much worse."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But a bigger question is whether or not our regulatory framework is fit for purpose given the potential uses of data in the modern world.","Big data offers insights and possibilities for manipulation that go beyond privacy. They touch directly on the right to freedom of thought - a right that is protected absolutely in human rights law. Quite simply, if an activity interferes with our freedom of thought, it should not be allowed and States have an obligation to protect us from it.

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S.

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I’m going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back.

Dutton has received funding from Merit, Rocket Fiber, Google, the UK's Economic and Social Research Council, and the Institute for Public Policy Research at MSU. He has never been funded by Facebook.","The idea that governments can regulate their way into protecting citizen privacy is appealing, but I believe it misses the mark.","What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn’t a breach or a leak. It was a wild violation of academic research ethics. The story is still developing, but a college researcher has now acknowledged that he harvested Facebook users’ data and gave it to another company.","A scholar and his company failed to protect sensitive research data. A university did not do enough to stop him. Regulating Facebook won’t solve these problems.","What Kogan did wrong","I am a professor of media and information policy at the Quello Center at Michigan State University, and I was one of the first academics to study the internet. The quality and integrity of digital research is of great concern to me.","I think the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook incident is a total disaster. I just don’t think it’s a government regulatory failure.","Through online surveys, he was reportedly able to gather sensitive personal information on tens of millions of American Facebook users, including demographic data, private messages, information about their friends and possibly even information about the friends of their friends.","Kogan then provided this data to a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. According to the New York Times, the company analyzed that information, aiming to help shape the 2016 Trump campaign’s messages and identify potential Trump voters.","What Facebook did wrong","So did Facebook do something wrong, then? In my opinion, not really.","Facebook already has strict guidelines outlining what can and can’t be done with user data, which the researcher appears to have violated by passing the personal data he collected to Cambridge Analytica.","When Facebook launched in 2004, it quickly became a goldmine for social researchers. Suddenly, studies that previously relied only on survey data to gather information about individuals could directly observe how people connected to one another, what they liked, and what bound groups together.","In the early years, the company took an open and experimental attitude toward this kind of data mining, even teaming up with researchers to study how tweaking certain features of individual’s Facebook pages affected voter turnout, say, or impacted their moods.","Today, the company requires an extensive internal review of every request to extract personal data from users for research purposes.","In other words, Facebook self-regulated.","It may have been lax in enforcing its guidelines, though. The company says that once it learned that Cambridge Analytica had used Kogan’s data set for unauthorized purposes, it insisted that the data be deleted.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix has been suspended over the Facebook scandal.Henry Nicholls/Reuters","What academia does wrong","For me, what the Cambridge Analytica fiasco exposes is that university ethical review processes are not yet equipped for the digital age.","University researchers are bound by strict ethical guidelines. Across the world – particularly in the U.K., with its strong social research traditions – academics who want to study the attitudes or behavior of private individuals must first pass a stringent review process. They must also obtain explicit, informed consent from those who participate in their research.","Universities around the globe actually encourage faculty to develop entrepreneurial companies, as Kogan did. That helps their research reach beyond campus to foster innovation in business, industry and government.","But the norms and rules that protect participants in academic research – such as not sharing identifiable personal data – do not stop at the door of the university.","Kogan’s exploits show that professors’ outside jobs may raise conflicts of interest and may have escaped the reach of institutional review. This is an area of academic work-for-hire that universities need to review with an eye toward updating how they enforce research ethics."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Cambridge Analytica? Facebook? Users ourselves? - The Hindu","text":["Who is to blame? Cambridge Analytica? Facebook? Users ourselves?","March 28, 2018, 16:50IST","share this article","We are rightfully incensed over the alleged use of online behavioral data to create psychographic profiles and target us users on the basis of our own personality. But wake up and smell who traded their privacy for convenience in the first place.","We live in a strange era where we care intensely about our privacy and simultaneously bandy it about on the most public of platforms — the social media. | AP/Imaging","Silicon Valley has its own rules. It’s the new economy, after all. Traditional valuation doesn’t necessarily apply. The companies which are the most valuable are the companies with the most information, not necessarily the most products, or the most sales. ‘Number of Daily Active Users’, ‘Time spent’, ‘Level of engagement’ and ‘Behavioral insights’ are the new measures of value.","These companies are valued on the basis of the data that they are harvesting off us and, consequently, how well they know us. They are valued on the basis of how deeply they have infiltrated our private lives. Strip away all the financial jargon and you will realise that the primary reason why the market values these companies so highly is that they have built up an astronomical database of user data that can be leveraged and monetised.","In slightly different terms, when we log into Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Amazon or Google, we aren’t customers using a product — we become the product. Our lives, our activities, our deepest darkest secrets, our cravings, our fears, our voyeurism — crystallised into ‘data points’. And if that wasn’t enough, it is ‘social’. So, we help these companies grow their data by connecting with friends, and pulling exponentially more people on board this mass data harvester. We make our own decisions but have willingly chosen to expose our lives, our likes, dislikes, our friends and their lives to massive Big Data Crunchers. Why? Because it is convenient. Because it was ‘free’. Yes, because instead of charging someone a huge amount of money to have access to our personal lives and information, we willingly gave it away in exchange for ‘convenience’. For the opportunity to stay in touch with friends. Actually, scratch that; it was for the opportunity to peek into other peoples lives. And for the opportunity to project an image of oneself to all of one’s acquaintances. Zuckerberg made his billions not by writing killer code — he made his money by understanding just how desperate we are for approval, just how voyeuristic we can be, and how little we value our own privacy when offered ease in exchange.","Silicon Valley has a particular talent for preachy spiels. Once we look past the Valleyspeak quotes like ‘Making the World a Better Place’, we can see this exchange for exactly what it is — an exchange of information for convenience. It is a choice that we made... a sort of Faustian deal. Technically, they informed us. But did we really read all the legal gobbledegook before clicking ‘I Accept’?","Zuckerberg, that master of spin, in a post on Facebook in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica data breach, attempts to mollify, apologise, reassure and preach at the same time. He tries to reflect the anger that Facebook users have been venting when he talks about how his company “doesn’t deserve to serve” users if they cannot keep their data safe. He goes on to try and reassure us by telling us that ‘corrective action’ was taken years ago (after the breach) and that this sort of thing could not happen again. The underlying theme is that Facebook serves us (which is the exactly backwards — in reality, we serve Facebook) and that they are a responsible and trusted organisation who have suffered a data breach. Those of us who ‘felt unsafe’ because an unauthorised agency had gained access to our data could now be ‘reassured’ that our trusted friend Mark solved the data breach problem. Except that if you scratch the surface, you can expose the flaws in the logic.","For a start, he didn’t tell us why his company was silent about the Cambridge Analytica story for as long as they were. If indeed it was ‘our’ information that he was guarding like a faithful, trustworthy watchman (because he believes that by ‘serving’ us he is making the world a better place), then he would have alerted us as soon as the breach occurred. The reality, as it emerges, is that unethical data trawling by app developers was something of an open secret. By their own admission, Facebook attempted to persuade Cambridge Analytica to delete the data. And they only responded when they were forced to, when it all blew up in their faces, and when their share price took a hit. Some experts are of the view that it is beginning to look as if the flaw is systemic, and that the CA data breach isn’t a one-off blip, as the folks at Facebook would have us believe.","Few people got on Facebook because they trusted Facebook with their deepest darkest secrets — most people got on Facebook because their friends were on Facebook. It wasn’t really a well-thought-out decision, robust in logic. It was an impulsive, almost illogical choice in most cases. It was a sticky, addictive, fun way of connecting and sharing our lives. The truth is, we suspended our rationality when we signed up, when we didn’t really read the disclaimer, when we didn’t exchange queries and emails with this company before entrusting it with so much personal information. It was easy... and fun... and addictive as hell. So we didn’t give them our information because we trusted them or their ethical standards. We signed up on a whim, because our friends were signed up. It was really that simplistic a drive.","The generation that uses social media never really had to fight for civil rights or liberties. And because we have never had to fight for our freedom and privacy, we do not value it enough.","If you follow this line of reasoning, it doesn’t really matter who has this very personal, private information about private civilian citizens. The real problem is that such a database exists. If it exists, the chances are that it will be misused. And it only exists because we are ok with it, because we willingly barter our freedom and privacy away without a thought or care in the world.","And so, to those who are outraged about Cambridge Analytica, I ask you to consider an alternative hypothetical scenario. Assume that Cambridge Analytica paid a whopping large sum of money to Facebook and acquired all the information legally. Or what if Cambridge Analytica bought enough stake in the company to warrant a position on the board? When such large sums of money and vast swathes of data are involved, the best coders and statisticians will engage the best lawyers to find ways and means to make it happen. Cambridge Analytica will still have access to your information — information that they will sell or use in any way they choose to profit from. Is a data sale any different from a data breach, as far as you are concerned? The only difference is that Facebook makes a fortune in a sale, but doesn’t when it is stolen.","Or consider another hypothetical scenario where Facebook itself diversified (very quietly and obscurely) into professional political campaign management. No data breach. But your data is being used by the very same people who bought it from CA. Are you better off?","Or perhaps consider a hypothetical scenario where Mark Zuckerberg decides to run for President. Again, no data breach. But you have a candidate who knows his electorate better than any candidate in history. Unfair advantage? Manipulating the electorate? Are you any better off?","Back home in India, I have been amused by the charges and counter-charges being bandied about by the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party about who used the services of Cambridge Analytica. It wouldn’t surprise me one bit to come to know that both of them hired the firm for availing its user/voter analytics research. The stakes are so high and the data is so thorough, complete and personal, that even if one of them felt any pangs of conscience about using the data, the thought or fear of their rival approaching CA would drive them to use CA’s services anyway. And, lets face it, buying or using dubiously acquired data from a consulting firm to help in political campaigns would not feature in the list of the ‘1,000 most Heinous Crimes Committed by Political Parties in India’.","Perhaps the saddest fallout of this entire fiasco is the revelation of just how little we value our freedom and privacy. Perhaps we take it for granted. The generation that uses social media never really had to fight for civil rights or liberties. Indira Gandhi’s Emergency, to us, is a chapter in a history book. And because we have never had to fight for our freedom and privacy, we do not value it enough. We trade it in for the opportunity to stay in touch with an old school crush, to impress our friends, or keep tabs on our relatives. Any outrage that we feel towards Cambridge Analytica or Facebook must first be directed inwards.","And yes, in case you are wondering, I do appreciate the sheer deliciousness of the irony in sharing an article about the perils and evils of social media on social media itself."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The reasons fell into three buckets: targeted advertising, security, and evaluation and improvement of services (“business intelligence”).","For a window of 30 days, WhatsApp offered users the option of opting out of data sharing for the purposes of advertising, but no way to entirely opt out of the new data sharing scheme.","The move outraged privacy advocates. After all, at the time of its $19 billion acquisition by Facebook in 2014, WhatsApp had promised never to share data.","That promise goes back further still. In November 2009, WhatsApp founder Jan Koum posted this to the company’s blog:","So first of all, let’s set the record straight. We have not, we do not and we will not ever sell your personal information to anyone. Period. End of story. Hopefully this clears things up.","Clear as mud. In December, France told WhatsApp and Facebook to knock off the data sharing. France’s ultra-vigilant privacy watchdog, the Chair of the National Data Protection Commission (CNIL), gave WhatsApp and Facebook a month to comply with an order to stop sharing data. In its public notice, it said that the messaging app will face sanctions for sharing user phone numbers and usage data for “business intelligence” purposes if it didn’t comply.","WhatsApp swore that it would work to comply with all these data protection authorities, even though they were all barking out differing orders:","We’re committed to resolving the different, and at times conflicting, concerns we’ve heard from European Data Protection Authorities with a common EU approach before the General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May 2018.","Ahhh, the GDPR: it’s right around the corner, and it features in that public commitment the ICO got WhatsApp to sign.","The document outlines the history of WhatsApp’s privacy policy before and after the Facebook acquisition. The upshot: outside of using UK customers’ data as a “data processor” – data sharing done in order for Facebook to provide support service to WhatsApp, such as to run its messaging service, or perhaps to help out a business that takes out an ad on Facebook to refer people to its WhatsApp account – there’s been no data shared.","My investigation has not been concerned about WhatsApp’s sharing of personal data with Facebook when Facebook are only providing a support service to WhatsApp.","The technical term for such sharing is that WhatsApp can use Facebook as a data processor. This is common practice and if done consistently with the law, under contract, does not generally raise data protection concerns.","In the public commitment, WhatsApp promises to refrain from sharing data with Facebook until the GDPR comes into effect in May, and only if it can do so in accordance with the regulation.","Denham said in her announcement that the investigation had been sparked by outcry from the public and from regulators over WhatsApp and Facebook sharing data.","At the heart of these concerns lies a desire for improved transparency, control, and accountability, at a time when personal data is ever more central to the business models of key players in the digital economy.","One of many examples of that loud outcry: The EU’s influential privacy body, the Article 29 Working Party (WP29), in October 2016 published an unflattering open letter outlining its worries.","Isabelle Falque Pierrotin, who chairs the working party, explained the problem, which was that the new terms had contradicted promises made to users when they signed up for the service:","These changes have been introduced in contradiction with previous public statements of the two companies ensuring that no sharing of data would ever take place.","The companies had also been vague about the precise nature of the sharing, she said:","The Article 29 Working Party has serious concerns regarding the manner in which the information relating to the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy was provided to users and consequently about the validity of the users’ consent.","Post navigation","About the author","Lisa has been writing about technology, careers, science and health since 1995.

DataSift, the London-based company that pulls data from conversations across social, news and blog platforms, anonymises it, and then parses it for insights for third party organizations, is being acquired by Meltwater, the company originally out of Norway but now based in San Francisco that provides business intelligence services such as media monitoring and AI analytics on internal business communications. Financial terms are not being disclosed for the deal but it includes technology, employees and DataSift’s customer base. DataSift had raised about $72 million in funding from investors that include Insight Venture Partners, Scale Ventures and Upfront Ventures and the company had never disclosed its valuation. Meltwater is bootstrapped and has never raised outside funding, but it has also been described as a “unicorn” with a billion-dollar valuation — a description that the company would not confirm but also does not contest. DataSift’s CEO Tim Barker, who is taking on a role at Meltwater leading his team there, said that it’s business as usual for DataSift’s existing customers, while the two will also work on integrating their platforms together. Combined, the customer base includes media companies, brands and educational and other organizations that make use of the data. Disclosed customer names include Viacom, Ogilvy, Air France, Vans, Harvard Business School and Columbia Business School. The news comes at an interesting time in the world of social media, and more specifically the data that swirls around it. Over the weekend, we saw a huge story break about how the analytics firm Cambridge Analytica was involved in what has amounted to a data scandal: an affiliate working with the firm had used an innocuous-looking research survey to in turn tap into the social graphs and the related data of respondents, by way of Facebook’s API, netting tens of millions of profiles in the process. The fallout is likely to be felt for a long time to come, and may well bring about a new kind of regulation and scrutiny over how personal data is harnessed and used in social networks. While this is raising a lot of questions already about personal data and social media, DataSift and Meltwater, to be clear, sit at a different section of the data and media continuum. While Meltwater focuses on what’s produced either internally at a business, or by publications and other media companies, DataSift’s currency is the movement of information that’s already being put out onto social networks in public posts, rather than personal details or attributes of users. As Barker describes it, the company has taken an approach that it calls “privacy by design,” in which it works only with anonymised data to reach its insights, and that work is not focused on how to use that data to rebuild profiles or “types” that can be used to match people back up with ads or other marketing. The idea will be to bring that together with Meltwater’s existing business to enhance it. “By combining advances in machine learning and the vast amount of publicly available information on the internet, you can today understand and track Porter’s Five Forces,” — a framework for analysing a business’ competitors — “in real time to understand strategic opportunities and threats for your business. Executives that take advantage of this new opportunity create an unfair information advantage over those who don’t,” said Jorn Lyseggen, CEO and founder of Meltwater in a statement. “DataSift has built a scalable platform that lets developers build data science-driven insights from social firehoses while protecting the privacy of an individual’s data. When combined with the data Meltwater captures and our AI capabilities, developers can disrupt the Business Intelligence space by either building new applications or complementing existing ones with unique signal that can be only derived from external data.” All the same, it will be interesting to see what the affects are on businesses like these. For one, DataSift currently is built on the cooperation (and by the grace) of social networks — by way of APIs and access to firehoses of data that DataSift and companies like it use to feed their analytics engines. Whether the social media companies decide they would like to try their hands at some of that business themselves, or perhaps get told by regulators that they simply can no longer share information in this way, this leaves companies that are built on that access in a precarious position. And that’s before you consider the effects of existing legislation like GDPR, which Meltwater says is something the company is built to handle. “DataSift’s advanced analytics platform is a great compliment to what we have in house, at a time of growing privacy concerns and regulation such as GDPR,” said Aditya Jami, Senior Director of Engineering and Head of AI at Meltwater. “DataSift’s technology will be instrumental… to deliver next generation insights.” DataSift in its past had a very notable instance of getting cut off from one of those feeds, and feeling the strong after effects: after years of working closely together and being the main users of Twitter’s firehose of Tweets — access that was brokered when DataSift handed over to Twitter the first third-party website “retweet” button to Twitter, created when DataSift was called TweetMeme — Twitter cut off DataSift from its firehose in the wake of a move to beef up its own big-data analytics business. DataSift eventually regrouped and now works with around 15 partners, including Facebook, LinkedIn and WordPress, but given that its original premise was based around the kind of real-time data that Twitter uniquely provides, it was a big shift for the startup. Meltwater has had its own scuffles in the past with the third-party services it relies on to make the wheels of its business model turn. Both have moved on from those more spiky years, it seems. Fast forward to today, the combination of Meltwater and DataSift makes some sense when you think about the evolution of media. The rise of social networking has created another playing field for businesses: they now have a new set of platforms where they can pick up chatter about themselves, and it’s become the hot new place to communicate with customers. Whether Facebook wants to admit it or not, social networking has become the modern-day descendent of the old-school media industry, and this is one aspect of that. While DataSift was built on trying to better harness and parse chatter from the former, Meltwater was built on the back of media monitoring to essentially provide the same services on the latter. http://ift.tt/2poPZQn – pradodesign","text":["from Pradodesign Meltwater has acquired DataSift to double down on social media analytics","In a week when all eyes are on Facebook and the subject of how data about us on social media platforms gets used without us knowing, there’s been some consolidation afoot in the world of media-based big data services. DataSift, the London-based company that pulls data from conversations across social, news and blog platforms, anonymises it, and then parses it for insights for third party organizations, is being acquired by Meltwater, the company originally out of Norway but now based in San Francisco that provides business intelligence services such as media monitoring and AI analytics on internal business communications.","Financial terms are not being disclosed for the deal but it includes technology, employees and DataSift’s customer base. DataSift had raised about $72 million in funding from investors that include Insight Venture Partners, Scale Ventures and Upfront Ventures and the company had never disclosed its valuation. Meltwater is bootstrapped and has never raised outside funding, but it has also been described as a “unicorn” with a billion-dollar valuation — a description that the company would not confirm but also does not contest.","DataSift’s CEO Tim Barker, who is taking on a role at Meltwater leading his team there, said that it’s business as usual for DataSift’s existing customers, while the two will also work on integrating their platforms together. Combined, the customer base includes media companies, brands and educational and other organizations that make use of the data. Disclosed customer names include Viacom, Ogilvy, Air France, Vans, Harvard Business School and Columbia Business School.","The news comes at an interesting time in the world of social media, and more specifically the data that swirls around it. Over the weekend, we saw a huge story break about how the analytics firm Cambridge Analytica was involved in what has amounted to a data scandal: an affiliate working with the firm had used an innocuous-looking research survey to in turn tap into the social graphs and the related data of respondents, by way of Facebook’s API, netting tens of millions of profiles in the process. The fallout is likely to be felt for a long time to come, and may well bring about a new kind of regulation and scrutiny over how personal data is harnessed and used in social networks.","While this is raising a lot of questions already about personal data and social media, DataSift and Meltwater, to be clear, sit at a different section of the data and media continuum. While Meltwater focuses on what’s produced either internally at a business, or by publications and other media companies, DataSift’s currency is the movement of information that’s already being put out onto social networks in public posts, rather than personal details or attributes of users. As Barker describes it, the company has taken an approach that it calls “privacy by design,” in which it works only with anonymised data to reach its insights, and that work is not focused on how to use that data to rebuild profiles or “types” that can be used to match people back up with ads or other marketing.","The idea will be to bring that together with Meltwater’s existing business to enhance it.","“By combining advances in machine learning and the vast amount of publicly available information on the internet, you can today understand and track Porter’s Five Forces,” — a framework for analysing a business’ competitors — “in real time to understand strategic opportunities and threats for your business. Executives that take advantage of this new opportunity create an unfair information advantage over those who don’t,” said Jorn Lyseggen, CEO and founder of Meltwater in a statement.","“DataSift has built a scalable platform that lets developers build data science-driven insights from social firehoses while protecting the privacy of an individual’s data. When combined with the data Meltwater captures and our AI capabilities, developers can disrupt the Business Intelligence space by either building new applications or complementing existing ones with unique signal that can be only derived from external data.”","All the same, it will be interesting to see what the affects are on businesses like these. For one, DataSift currently is built on the cooperation (and by the grace) of social networks — by way of APIs and access to firehoses of data that DataSift and companies like it use to feed their analytics engines. Whether the social media companies decide they would like to try their hands at some of that business themselves, or perhaps get told by regulators that they simply can no longer share information in this way, this leaves companies that are built on that access in a precarious position.","And that’s before you consider the effects of existing legislation like GDPR, which Meltwater says is something the company is built to handle.","“DataSift’s advanced analytics platform is a great compliment to what we have in house, at a time of growing privacy concerns and regulation such as GDPR,” said Aditya Jami, Senior Director of Engineering and Head of AI at Meltwater. “DataSift’s technology will be instrumental… to deliver next generation insights.”","DataSift in its past had a very notable instance of getting cut off from one of those feeds, and feeling the strong after effects: after years of working closely together and being the main users of Twitter’s firehose of Tweets — access that was brokered when DataSift handed over to Twitter the first third-party website “retweet” button to Twitter, created when DataSift was called TweetMeme — Twitter cut off DataSift from its firehose in the wake of a move to beef up its own big-data analytics business.","DataSift eventually regrouped and now works with around 15 partners, including Facebook, LinkedIn and WordPress, but given that its original premise was based around the kind of real-time data that Twitter uniquely provides, it was a big shift for the startup.","Meltwater has had its own scuffles in the past with the third-party services it relies on to make the wheels of its business model turn.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Not a Facebook lawyer, like the one the company sent to Congress last year for hearings on how fake news swamped tech platforms such as, oh, Facebook. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tweeted:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The investigation published by the Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica, after receiving $15 million from conservative donor Robert Mercer in 2014 to micro-target voters, obtained the information to do so in a questionable way. A British professor collected the information from Facebook, saying he was conducting an academic personality study. He did get the approval of about 270,000 people who signed up to take part in the study — they were told their information would be used. He did not, however, get the permission of the users’ friends, whose information was also gathered — an estimated 50 million people.","It’s not just that such an action is unethical. It might well be a violation of an agreement Facebook made with the federal government. Two former employees of the Federal Trade Commission have now told The Post that it’s quite possible that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement with the agency to notify and offer users an out when there is an effort to use their personal information in a way not in line with their privacy settings. This agreement was reached after consumer groups complained that Facebook was cavalier with personal information.","So back to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out, courtesy of a 2015 piece in the Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica and British academics had information on many users that agreed to such a collection, it demanded the information be destroyed. This did not happen. Facebook cited this when pressed on the latest revelations by the Times, claiming that the companies that misused the data “certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","(On Monday afternoon, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica agreed to a digital audit to prove it destroyed the disputed materials. The professors involved in using the data also agreed to an audit.)","And so, after the Times published its piece, Facebook didn’t own up to what happened. Instead, Facebook executives have gotten into a multiplespats with reporters and others over whether the Cambridge Analytica incident is a “breach” or a mere misuse of personal information, since some (but not all!) the people whose data was involved did give permission for their data to be taken and the company was not actually hacked. Facebook’s motive for this is almost certainly legal and regulatory. As Bloomberg News notes, a “breach” is a specific term that requires the company to notify users their information was illegally accessed.","But there is quite possibly a bigger motive. Painting Cambridge Analytica as the villain is an attempt to get Facebook off the hook for its ongoing role in everything from other invasions of privacy (more about that in a moment) to the ongoing complaints about its role in spreading fake news in the 2016 elections. If one or two rogue companies such as Cambridge Aanlytica — and not Facebook — are responsible for this mass misuse of data, perhaps the company can say more regulation is not needed.","But don’t fall for the idea that Facebook is not the problem. This is hardly a first-time offense for Facebook, which — a reminder — allowed fake news to flood many users’ news feeds in the months leading up to the 2016 elections.","In fact, Washington perhaps should have gotten interested in Facebook well before the Trump election contretemps. Over time, Facebook has indulged in numerous instances of dodgy behavior. There was the time Facebook altered news feeds to study whether they could affect the mood of people on the platform. There was the reveal that its platform permitted ad buyers to target people with such delightful terms as “jew hater.” And the discovery that Facebook made it possible to target housing ads to whites only.","Whether this latest scandal was a breach or a misuse of information is irrelevant. It was wrong. Zuckerberg needs to explain — slowly and clearly and without legal terminology or whiny excuses — what went wrong at the company he founded in his Harvard dorm room, and what steps the company is taking to make sure it never happens again. My suspicion? He can’t do that. Instead, a Zuckerberg appearance will demonstrate the need for significant federal regulation of large technology platforms.

Most are probably correct, because many factors were involved. There is one important factor that isn’t written about much — that the side using superior science and technology won. The science and technology were used to deliver propaganda that bashed Hillary Clinton as if she were extremely corrupt, to keep likely Democratic voters away from the polls at election time.","Republicans have been more skilled at political marketing than Democrats. Democrats are science believers when it comes to global climate change. But we’re back in the Dark Ages when it comes to the science of marketing.","We’re science deniers in that area. Frank Luntz has been doing sophisticated marketing research for the Republican party for decades. He tests out different phrasing of messages, to find the right wording so that voters will respond positively. His book, Words That Work, describes his research.","Have Democrats caught up with this, even after decades? No. Democrats don’t do much research on messaging. Democrats do research to find out what voters want. They don’t do much research on how voters respond to different phrases or ways of communicating policies.","The closest Democrats come to doing that is when they follow the advice of George Lakoff, which they didn’t do in 2016. However, Lakoff is an academic — a cognitive linguist. He doesn’t conduct political focus groups like Luntz does. His theories — and ideas from others also — need to be tested in focus groups, to see how voters respond. That’s how science works. Theories must be tested.","Still, Lakoff is perhaps the best Democrats have, for a person who specializes in framing. Did Hillary Clinton’s campaign use his work? No. The Democratic National Committee didn’t use Lakoff’s method during the campaign either.","There are other people who study or write about framing from a progressive perspective. One is Anat Shenker-Osorio who wrote an excellent book on framing of messages about the economy Don’t Buy It: The Trouble with Talking Nonsense about the Economy.","Another one is Stan Greenberg. Here’s a book in which he discusses what he thinks political research and polling reveal about our nation, America Ascendant: A Revolutionary Nation’s Path to Addressing Its Deepest Problems and Leading the 21st Century.","Does the Democratic party use such people, so that they can do large political marketing research studies? No. The party mostly leaves such people in the shadows, ignoring them.","Marketing research of this nature is still horse and buggy level technology, compared to mathematically advanced data analysis that uses social media. Yet Democrats haven’t even caught up with basic marketing research yet. Obama did use technology and social media briefly, as an article I’ll cite later on shows. But Democrats didn’t carry on this practice.","Why don’t Democrats use technology for political marketing? Many Democrats think that you don’t need to market the truth — that only untrue statements need to be sold, in order for people to believe them. Many Democratic pundits and comedians refer to people who believe false political stories as “stupid” — as though only stupid people are vulnerable to propaganda. If only that were so. Anyone can be vulnerable.","People telling the truth on TV don’t have a halo appearing over their heads, to let the viewers know. People speaking lies don’t suddenly have devil’s horns sprouting out of their heads. Media consumers often don’t know what the truth is. There is an old adage that has been around for hundreds of years that says:","“A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.”","That’s the reality about whether truth has to be sold as intensively as lies do.","Once Democrats start doing focus group research on messaging, political operatives need to also go beyond this. The current cutting edge of science and technology in the field of elections is in the use of computers to analyze social media to understand voter preferences.","Such analyses are used to discover the kinds of messages to which voters respond. Then campaigns can know how to effectively market their candidates to voters, using social media. It’s what Cambridge Analytica did for Donald Trump’s campaign. Recent information points to Russia having also done this.","Devil’s Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency, by Joshua Green, describes how Steve Bannon, financed by the Mercer family, helped to elect Donald Trump.","The Mercers bankrolled four different interlocking organizations for the purpose of discrediting Hillary Clinton and marketing Republican presidential candidates.","One of the four was Breitbart News, a media outlet that basically preaches to the Republican choir. Some Democratic media outlets preach to the choir too. However, Bannon, and Andrew Breitbart before him, recognized the power of dramatic narratives with heroes and villains. Breitbart News uses dramatic narratives of this kind and keeps them going continuously over time. So they preach to the choir far more effectively.","Humans love stories. When we watch a film or a TV show, or listen to a song, we are usually responding to a story. Some people believe that when we turn on the news, we are doing something very different. We’re not.","Another way that Breitbart is more effective than most progressive publications is that it’s consistent in its viewpoint. However, there are no large purely Left Wing or progressive media organizations. There are ones that people generally think of as Left Wing, but they’re not. They may contain more Left Wing than Right Wing views, but they cover both sides. Major newspapers do this. Even MSNBC is becoming more inclusive of Right Wing views, as the article below describes.","As much as the Right Wing may complain about Left Wing media bias, it actually doesn’t exist to a significant degree in any large media outlet. Right Wing media have convinced their consumers that media overall have a Left Wing bias. However, that’s not true. It’s a testament to the power of Right Wing propaganda, that so many people can be persuaded to believe something so obviously untrue.","In contrast to people on the Left, Right Wing leaning people can tune into Right Wing TV or radio, or read Internet publications, staying constantly within their own bubble and safe space. They can receive an uninterrupted whole cloth Right Wing world view, with interlocking dramatic narratives that continue over time.","Those on the Left, by contrast, are stuck with individual fragments of a Left Wing world view, frequently interrupted by coverage of the other side’s point of view, which may be lies. The Republican whole cloth view seems like it would be easier to take in, process and follow. However, that’s an empirical question — one that could need to be answered by research.","The second of the four interlocking organizations led by Bannon and financed by the Mercers, was the Government Accountability Institute. Legally, it is a 501(c)(3) research organization that is considered to be nonpartisan. This organization was used to research information that might discredit the Clintons and to spread it to nonpartisan media outlets in ways that those outlets would accept and even welcome.","The Hillary Clinton hit job book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, was produced through this organization. A third organization, a film company, produced the movie version of the book.","The fourth and last of the interlocking organizations covered in Joshua Green’s book, is a data analytics company, used for the purpose of researching how to influence elections and voters’ opinions, using propaganda. This organization advises governments and militaries on ways to influence voters. This is an international organization, the American affiliate of which is Cambridge Analytica.","Here is an article quoting Trump’s digital director as saying that the election was won on Facebook, using highly targeted ads.","A TED Talk by techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufekci contains further information about how Donald Trump’s social media manager used Facebook to get likely Hillary voters to stay home from the polls in the 2016 election. The relevant part is from around 11:50 minutes to around 13:00 minutes on the video or the transcript.","Donald Trump and his campaign organization seemed to be primitive, stumbling through the campaign chaotically. Yet here were these highly sophisticated organizations shoring them up in the background, unseen by voters.","Democrats don’t need to lie, like Right Wing media and social media do. In fact, we ought to lead the way in spreading truth and in fighting fake news and lies in media.","The public needs to pressure mainstream media, Right Wing media, and social media, to do what is necessary to stop the spread of fake news lies. While the Democratic party has much work to do, the public also needs to pitch in and do our part. The party can research effective messaging and can spread the truth. But perhaps it is the public that can make the most difference in fighting fake news, in order to stop the spread of propaganda.","However, the Democratic party does need to market the truth just as aggressively as Republicans market fake news and lies. We also need to spread the word far and wide that Right Wingers are constantly targeting likely Democratic voters with propaganda that is designed to persuade us to stay home from the polls on election day. Fighting back against this propaganda is is the most important way of resisting the Right Wing agenda. We must never let Republican propagandists influence us this way again.","Good grassroots organizing and Get out the Vote efforts go a long way. The elections held on November 7, 2017, which many Democrats won, proved this. The election of Doug Jones to the Senate representing Alabama, in December 2017, proved this yet again. Jones and Alabama Democrats pushed hard to get out the vote.","Nine years before these 2017 elections, Obama’s team had built an amazing grassroots army to get out the vote for his first presidential campaign. He gave the contacts to the Democratic party, and they were discarded. That was a large mistake, as the DNC threw away that information. Democrats need to rebuild that network, so that their grassroots organizing in all states can be improved.","Why are so many Democrats still in the Dark Ages, in the areas of science and technology? I have already discussed the mistaken belief that the truth doesn’t need to be marketed. Some Democrats also have some discomfort with using technology and social media data analysis. Maybe Democrats need to start attending personal growth workshops to work through their hang ups about technology.","I also think some Democrats need to find ways to blast through their hang ups about being comfortable using power politics.","In fact, Democrats could use an outrage machine, in order to stand up for progressive media and politicians. Republicans have an outrage machine. Media and government officials bow to it, giving Republicans their way, leaving Democrats at a disadvantage.","Many Democrats are fair to a fault, literally. We may hesitate to firmly state and defend our values, for fear of offending others with different views. Some Democrats bend over backwards to be fair to opponents and to compromise.","This approach works if the opponent acts this way too. However, if the opponent is a “Give ’em and inch, they take a mile” sort, then Democrats are in trouble. This issue is confusing to some people, because the Republican party has changed in recent decades and become more partisan, uncompromising and corrupt. The current Democratic strategies may have worked in the past, but need to be updated.","The time is ripe for Democrats to enter into the world of science, technology and power. It may be a challenge we’ll have to rise to, but we’ll be glad we did."],"isopubdate":"2017-10-14"}

{"originalurl":"https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/","title":"Foreign nationals | FEC","text":["Foreign nationals","June 23, 2017","The FEC often receives questions about the rules governing foreign nationals’ participation in U.S. elections. While this article responds to some of the most common questions, it does not cover all aspects of foreign national activity. Readers should consult the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act) and Commission regulations, advisory opinions, and relevant case law for additional information. For questions involving proposed activity for which there may not be clear guidance, you may consider requesting your own advisory opinion (AO) from the Commission. Please note, however, that the Commission’s jurisdiction is limited to provisions of the Act and does not include other laws that may also apply to foreign national activity.","The Act and Commission regulations include a broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States. 52 U.S.C. § 30121 and generally, 11 CFR 110.20. In general, foreign nationals are prohibited from the following\nactivities:","Making any contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or making any expenditure,\nindependent expenditure, or disbursement in connection with any federal, state or local election in the United States;","Making any contribution or donation to any committee or organization of any national, state, district, or local political party (including donations to a party nonfederal account or office\nbuilding account);","Making any disbursement for an electioneering communication;","Making any donation to a presidential inaugural committee.","Persons who knowingly and willfully engage in these activities may be subject to an FEC enforcement action, criminal prosecution, or both.","Definition","The following groups and individuals are considered \"foreign nationals\" and are subject to the prohibition:","Foreign citizens (not including dual citizens of the United States);","Immigrants who are not lawfully admitted for permanent residence;","Foreign governments;","Foreign political parties;","Foreign corporations;","Foreign associations;","Foreign partnerships; and","Any other foreign principal, as defined at 22 U.S.C. § 611(b), which includes a foreign organization or “other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country.”","Individuals: The \"green card\" exception","The Act does not prohibit individuals with permanent resident status (commonly referred to as “green card holders”) from making contributions or donations in connection with federal, state or local elections, as they are not considered foreign nationals.","Commission regulations prohibit foreign nationals from directing, dictating, controlling, or directly or indirectly participating in the decision-making process of any person (such as a corporation,\nlabor organization, political committee, or political organization) with regard to any election-related activities. Such activities\ninclude, the making of contributions, donations, expenditures, or disbursements in connection with any federal or nonfederal elections in the United States, or decisions concerning the administration of any political committee. Foreign nationals are\nalso prohibited from involvement in the management of a political committee, including any separate segregated fund (SSF), nonconnected committee, or the nonfederal accounts of any of\nthese committees. See Explanation and Justification for 11 CFR 110.20 at 67 FR 69946 (November 19, 2002) [PDF].","The Commission has pursued a number of enforcement actions related to this prohibition. For example, in Matter Under Review (MUR) 3460, the Commission reached a conciliation agreement with a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign corporation and four of its foreign\nnational directors. The directors, along with one director who was not a foreign national, passed a resolution authorizing a “contribution committee” to make political and charitable donations from a special account, and capitalizing the committee\nwith $50,000 in corporate funds. The one director who was not a foreign national was appointed as the sole member of the committee. The contribution committee subsequently made contributions to state and local candidates. The foreign nationals’ involvement\nin the decision to establish and fund the “contribution committee” meant that its subsequent contributions violated the ban on foreign nationals participating directly or indirectly in the making of contributions and donations in connection with elections.\nThe corporation and the foreign national directors paid a civil penalty.","Volunteer activity","Generally, an individual (including a foreign national) may volunteer personal services to a federal candidate or federal political committee without making a contribution. The Act provides this volunteer \"exemption\" as long as the individual performing\nthe service is not compensated by anyone. The Commission has addressed applicability of this exemption to several situations involving volunteer activity by a foreign national, as explained below.","In AO 2014-20 (Make Your Laws PAC), the Commission concluded that a political action committee could accept assistance from a foreign national in developing intellectual property\nfor the PAC, such as trademarks, graphics, and website design because the services accepted by the PAC would fall under the volunteer exemption. Similarly, in AO 2004-26 (Weller),\nthe Commission held that a foreign national could attend, speak at campaign events for a federal candidate, and solicit contributions to the campaign. However, the Commission cautioned that the foreign national could not manage or participate in any\nof the campaign committee’s decision-making processes. See also AOs 2007-22 (Hurysz) and 1987-25 (Otaola).","In MUR 5987, the Commission examined a situation in which a foreign national provided an uncompensated musical concert performance as a volunteer for a federal candidate’s campaign as part of a fundraising event. The candidate’s campaign had paid all\nof the costs of hosting the concert, including the rental of the venue and equipment and providing security. The performer had merely provided his uncompensated volunteer services to the campaign and had not participated in any of the campaign’s decision-making.\nBased on these facts, the Commission found no reason to believe that the foreign national or the federal candidate’s committee had violated the Act’s foreign national prohibition.","Non-election activity by foreign nationals","Despite the general prohibition on foreign national contributions and donations, foreign nationals may lawfully engage in political activity that is not connected with any election to political office at the federal, state, or local levels. The Commission\nhas issued advisory opinions that help to define the parameters of that activity.","In AO 1989-32 (McCarthy), the Commission concluded that a foreign national could not contribute to a ballot measure committee that had coordinated its efforts with a nonfederal candidate's\nre-election campaign. Also, in AO 1984-41 (National Conservative Foundation), the Commission allowed a foreign national to underwrite the broadcast of apolitical ads that attempted\nto expose the alleged political bias of the media. The Commission found that these ads were permissible because they were not “election influencing” in that they did not mention candidates, political offices, political parties, incumbent federal officeholders\nor any past or future election.","In a decision that was later affirmed by the Supreme Court, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the foreign national ban “does not restrain\nforeign nationals from speaking out about issues or spending money to advocate their views about issues. It restrains them only from a certain form of expressive activity closely tied to the voting process—providing money for a candidate or political\nparty or spending money in order to expressly advocate for or against the election of a candidate.” Bluman v. FEC, 800 F. Supp. 2d 281, 290 (D.D.C.\n2011), aff’d 132 S. Ct. 1087 (2012).","Providing assistance with foreign national election activity","Under Commission regulations, it is unlawful to knowingly provide “substantial assistance” to foreign nationals making contributions or donations in connection with any U.S. election. Further, no person may provide substantial assistance in the making\nof any expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement by a foreign national. \"Substantial assistance\" refers to active involvement in the solicitation, making, receipt or acceptance of a foreign national contribution or donation with the intent\nof facilitating the successful completion of the transaction. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to individuals who act as conduits or intermediaries. See Explanation and Justification for 11 CFR 110.20 at 67 FR 69945-46 (November 19, 2002) [PDF].","Soliciting, accepting, or receiving contributions and donations from foreign nationals","The Act prohibits knowingly soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions or donations from foreign nationals. In this context, \"knowingly\" means that a person:","Has actual knowledge that the funds solicited, accepted, or received are from a foreign national;","Is aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the funds solicited, accepted, or received are likely to be from a foreign national; or","Is aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to inquire whether the source of the funds solicited, accepted or received is a foreign national.","Pertinent facts that should cause the recipient of a contribution or donation to question whether it was given by a foreign national include, but are not limited to the following: a donor or contributor uses a foreign passport, provides a foreign address,\nmakes a contribution from a foreign bank, or resides abroad. Commission regulations provide for a safe harbor: obtaining a copy of a current and valid U.S. passport would satisfy the duty to inquire whether the funds solicited, accepted, or received\nare from a foreign national.","In AO 2016-10 (Parker), the Commission determined that a U.S. citizen living abroad could solicit contributions on behalf of federal candidates and committees from other U.S. citizens\nresiding abroad. She was required to ascertain the citizenship of the individuals whom she might solicit if she were aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to inquire or believe that those individuals were foreign nationals. However, the\nCommission advised the requestor, “Limiting your solicitations to friends and family who live in the U.S. and who have not, to your knowledge, lived abroad, would not obligate you to conduct further inquiry about citizenship status due to the residence\nof the individuals whom you solicit.” If, however, she were to obtain a copy of a valid U.S. passport, she would be covered by the safe harbor provision noted above.","In MUR 4834, an individual admitted knowingly and willfully soliciting a contribution from a foreign national and causing a foreign contribution to be made falsely in the name of a U.S. citizen. The individual also admitted that at the time of the solicitation,\nhe knew that the person he was soliciting was a foreign national and that contributions from foreign nationals were prohibited. The Commission entered into a conciliation agreement with the individual, and he agreed to pay a civil penalty.","In MUR 4638, the Commission found reason to believe that a law firm had violated the Act by knowingly solicited and provided “substantial assistance” to a foreign national making donations. Individuals at the firm participated in conversations with a\nknown foreign national and his agents that resulted in his making donations to state and local candidates. As a result of the Commission’s finding, the firm entered into a conciliation agreement with the Commission and agreed to pay a civil penalty.","Monitoring prohibited contributions","When a federal political committee (a committee active in federal elections) receives a contribution it believes may be from a foreign national, it must:","Return the contribution to the donor without depositing it; or","Deposit the contribution and take steps to determine its legality, as described below.","Either action must be taken within 10 days of the treasurer's receipt.","If the committee decides to deposit the contribution, the treasurer must make sure that the funds are not spent because they may have to be refunded. Additionally, he or she must maintain a written record explaining why the contribution may be prohibited.\nThe legality of the contribution must be confirmed within 30 days of the treasurer's receipt, or the committee must issue a refund.","Evidence of legality may include a written statement from the contributor explaining why the contribution is legal (e.g., donor has a green card or provides a copy of his or her valid U.S. passport), or an oral explanation that is recorded in memorandum.","If the committee deposits a contribution that appears to be legal, but later discovers that the deposited contribution is from a foreign national, it must refund the contribution within 30 days of making the discovery. If a committee lacks sufficient\nfunds to make a refund when a prohibited contribution is discovered, it must use the next funds it receives.","In MUR 4530 and several related MURs (MURs 4531, 4587, 4642, 4909, and 5295), the Commission found that several foreign nationals and corporations had made prohibited contributions to a federal candidate committee and to a national party committee. Several\ncommittees were assessed civil penalties for failing to issue refunds when they became aware that the funds were illegal.","Domestic subsidiaries and foreign-owned corporations","A U.S. subsidiary of a foreign corporation or a U.S. corporation that is owned by foreign nationals or by a foreign parent corporation may be subject to the prohibition, as discussed further below.","PAC contributions for federal activity","Based on a series of FEC advisory opinions, domestic subsidiaries of foreign corporations may establish federal political action committees (known as separate segregated funds or SSFs) for the purpose of make federal contributions and expenditures, so\nlong as:","The foreign parent corporation does not finance the SSF’s establishment, administration, or solicitation costs through the subsidiary; and","Individual foreign nationals:","Do not participate in the operation of the PAC;","Do not serve as officers of the PAC;","Do not participate in the selection of persons who operate the PAC; and","Do not make decisions regarding any PAC contributions or expenditures.","Corporate donations and disbursements for nonfederal activity","A domestic subsidiary of a foreign corporation (or a domestic corporation owned by foreign nationals) may make donations and disbursements in connection with state or local elections (if permissible under state and local law) provided that:","These activities are not financed in any part by the foreign parent or owner; and","Individual foreign nationals are not involved in any way in the making of donations to nonfederal candidates and committees.","For example, in AO 2006-15 (TransCanada), the Commission concluded that two wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries of a foreign corporation could make donations and disbursements in connection\nwith state and local elections so long as the funds used were generated by the U.S.-based subsidiary’s operations and not from the foreign parent and that all decisions regarding political donations would be made by U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\nSince the domestic subsidiaries maintained bank accounts in the U.S. that were separate from the foreign parent and did not receive subsidies from the foreign parent or from any other foreign national, the Commission concluded that the proposal was\npermitted under the Act.","Similarly, in AO 1992-16 (Nansay Hawaii, Inc.), the Commission considered a situation in which a foreign parent corporation provided “regular\nsubsidies [to its domestic subsidiary] in the form of loans or [donations] to capital…” The Commission determined that the domestic subsidiary could make state and local donations, provided that all decisions as to political donations were made by\nU.S. citizens or permanent residents and also that the subsidiary be able to demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method that it had sufficient funds in its account (other than funds given or loaned by its foreign national parent) from which\nthe donations were made. The Commission explicitly cautioned that, “[t]he amount that the foreign parent distributes to the subsidiary cannot replenish all or any portion of the subsidiary’s political [donations] during the period since the preceding\nsubsidy payment.”","In MUR 2892, the Commission entered into conciliation agreements with a number of respondents, including foreign individuals and businesses, who agreed to pay civil penalties for violations of the Act that involved prohibited contributions made to state\nand local candidates through U.S. corporations owned by foreign corporations or by foreign individuals. In this particular case, the Commission found reason to believe that the donations in question violated the foreign national prohibition because\nthey were allegedly financed directly by the foreign parent/owner or because individual foreign nationals were allegedly involved in making decisions concerning the contributions. (See also MURs 2864 and 3004.)","Read next:","Related:","This information is not intended to replace the law or to change its meaning, nor does this information create or confer any rights for or on any person or bind the Federal Election Commission or the public."],"isopubdate":""}

Without completely deleting your account, there may be no guarantee that your data is ever really private, but these steps can help you protect your personal information.","1. Beware of those fun \"quizzes\" and apps","One of the way researchers were able to gather information on Facebook users was through \"personality quizzes.\" Those are pretty common on the network, and users may find them as an attractive time-killer to learn more about themselves. Some of those quizzes allowed Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre to gather private information from Facebook profiles, including from friends and activities, the Times said. Remember: Nothing is free. If you're inputting data about yourself, especially in a random third-party app, you're giving it away.","2. Change your privacy settings","Facebook has a lot of privacy settings available to users, though you might not know about them. You can manage your own by tapping the drop-down arrow on the top-right of Facebook, choosing \"Settings\" and then selecting \"Privacy.\" Here, you can control who sees your posts, your phone number, your friend requests and more. Consider changing these settings so that only you can see this data. Remember: If a friend takes a quiz like the one mentioned above, they could be giving up their friends list, which includes you.","3. Beware who your friends are","That brings us to the next point: Beware who your friends are. If your friends aren't using strict privacy settings, then photos and other posts you're tagged in could still be shared or viewed by others. Facebook explicitly says this: \"Remember, your friends control who can see their friendships on their own Timelines. If people can see your friendship on another timeline, they'll be able to see it in News Feed, search and other places on Facebook.\" Consider pressing your friends to increase their security settings, too, and only befriending people you know and trust.","4. Consider avoiding third-party apps altogether","You might be tempted to install games and other apps that are available through Facebook, but doing so allows those apps to tap into your personal data, including your name, profile picture, gender, networks, username, friends list and other public information. You can manage what an app has access to by going to Settings and selecting \"Apps\" on the left side of the screen. You'll usually need to share your personal information just to use the app, but you can deselect the option to share your friends list, email address and more.","5. Turn on extra security settings","You can beef up your Facebook security even more by getting alerts when Facebook sees a login from a device or browser you don't typically use. You should also turn on two-factor authentication so that a code sent to your phone is required each time you log in. This will help — but not guarantee — to prevent others from accessing your account. Remember, though: Apps and friends can still share some of this data regardless of whether they're logged in to your account or not. To access these extra settings, go to Facebook's Settings page, select \"Security and Login\" from the left side and scroll down to the \"Setting Up Extra Security\" section.","6. Consider leaving Facebook","The best way to protect your private data, at least in light of the sort of data Cambridge Analytica was able to obtain, is to leave Facebook altogether. As CNBC's Matt Rosoff explained in a recent commentary, users of Facebook have now learned that information they share with Facebook \"can now be used in ways they did not intend.\" CNBC has a guide on how to deactivate your Facebook account in case you want to leave altogether."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor.

Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I’m going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends’ data.” Later in the same post, Zuckerberg claims that the issue surfaced again in 2015 and Facebook took action (perhaps not enough action) to bring the offending company into compliance with Facebook policies.","What Facebook Data Did They Get?","The full answer to this question will come out in the upcoming investigations and legal proceedings. But we can make a pretty good guess at what data Cambridge Analytica obtained by looking at the endpoints of Facebook’s Graph API v1.0 (application programming interface) which launched April 21, 2010, and wasn’t fully closed down until April 30, 2015.","Using Facebook’s Graph API v1.0, developers had unfettered access to almost all of your public-facing profile data, including:","The heart of the scandal focuses on one of the API’s permissions groups called “Extended Profile Properties.” These endpoints provided access to data about your friends that your friends may not have explicitly granted permission for Facebook to expose, specifically:","In another permissions group, the API exposed an endpoint called read_mailbox which, just as it sounds, allowed developers access to users’ private messages.","Wow, That’s a Lot of Data. What Can You Do with It?","With tens of millions of rich data profiles, you can apply the tools of data scientific research to turn the data into action. This usually follows a disciplined methodology that starts with transforming the data into usable cohorts and clusters, learning about the propensities of the different cohorts and clusters, and then predicting how they might react to messaging by using simulations (Will a $10 discount work better than a coupon for a 10 percent discount? Is this cohort likely to vote for X?). Optimization is another common use for data (Let’s optimize our media buy to drive 5 percent higher conversions by doing X. Let’s get more people to vote for X). None of this is new. None of this is news. This is how internet advertising works.","Wait. What?","As insane as this may sound, all of the sensationalist craziness, the ~$50 billion of Facebook value wiped out by the scandal, and all the talk of espionage and intrigue are basically about the realization that your data is used to serve you highly relevant, hyper-targeted messages. Again: Not new. Not news.","If Cambridge Analytica didn’t obtain this data set from Facebook, it could have simply purchased a bunch of data and used best practices mar-tech tools to accomplish its marketing goals. Not surprisingly, a fair number of digital marketers I’ve spoken to about this believe that Cambridge Analytica would have achieved better results by leveraging the platforms directly.","Why Do I Care about This?","The silver lining to the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal is the fact that you are becoming aware of what data you create, what is collected, and how it is used. This is a very good thing.","When Facebook urges you to configure your privacy settings, they are using the wrong words. The company should be advising you that you are actually configuring your “Public Persona Settings” or your “Online Presence Settings” or simply your “Public Settings.” Whom you share your stuff with and who gets to see it are practically meaningless in the context of this issue.","What you should be configuring is your “Personal Data Sharing Permission Settings” or “API Endpoint Permissions.” These settings would restrict the data that could be extracted while we are passively going about our business online.","Way Too Complicated!","No. It really isn’t. As a society, we have to raise our level of data maturity. Clearly Facebook has grown faster than it has matured. Societally, we are all neophytes when it comes to data literacy and data governance.","If you want control of your data, it would be a great idea to understand what that means. “They know everything about me,” says someone scared out of their wits by sensationalist headlines. No. They don’t. They have data that can be turned into action to enrich organizations smart enough to use it. Are you hurt by this? Could you be?","Right now, you get to use Facebook, Google, Gmail, Waze, and other “free” apps for the cost of your data. If you don’t want to pay with your data, you are welcome to make other choices. But you should understand how your data is being used before making a blanket statement that your data should be 100 percent private and 100 percent protected. Data is a form of currency, and it is a valid way to pay for goods and services. Data can be (and is) transformed into cash by tech companies. But that does not diminish the value of the services they provide.","Just because you did not take the time to learn how you were paying for a tech service and you thought it was “free” doesn’t mean it is actually free and, most importantly, that you would be willing to pay cash money for it.","So let’s use this scandal as an opportunity to learn as much as we can about data so when we start the regulatory process, we do it in a responsible way.","Author’s note: This is not a sponsored post.

A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts.

In 2011, Facebook agreed to settle charges—though admitted no actual fault—that it \"deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\" among other overreaches.","The settlement barred Facebook from making further deceptive privacy claims, required it obtain a user's explicit approval before changing the way it handles their data, and mandated that Facebook receive periodic assessments of its privacy practices by third-party auditors for the next 20 years. It didn't carry, however, any financial penalties.","'The Federal Trade must bring an enforcement action against Facebook.'","Marc Rotenberg, EPIC","The 2011 consent decree also required that users be notified explicitly if their data is shared beyond the privacy settings they have configured. Specifically, the FTC accused Facebook of telling users that they could limit their data to \"Friends Only,\" whereas in fact this setting did not prevent their information from being shared with third-party applications their friends used. Facebook finally did change this setting in 2014, but it was too late. Facebook may have violated that portion of the settlement by allowing Aleksandr Kogan, an academic at Cambridge University, to obtain data belonging not only to people who downloaded an app he created, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" but also those individuals' friends. The data collected from the app was later passed on to Cambridge Analytica, which reportedly retained it even after telling Facebook it had been deleted.","\"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" Pahl said in the statement Monday announcing the probe. \"Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Facebook says it is willing to answer the FTC's questions. \"We remain committed to protecting people's information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have,\" Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said in a statement.","For privacy advocates, the investigation is a long time coming, but also underscores the FTC's inability to regulate big platforms. \"The confirmation of the investigation is good news. The Federal Trade must bring an enforcement action against Facebook for the violation of the 2011 Consent order,\" Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said in a statement. EPIC has pushed for the FTC to take greater measures to regulate Facebook's data practices for years.","\"Almost everything [the FTC] does is not public, that is a huge drawback to that enforcement approach,\" says Michelle De Mooy, the director of the Privacy & Data Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology. She says that even if the FTC finds that Facebook violated its consent decree, the process by which it came to that conclusion likely won't be made public. The agency's secrecy makes it difficult to know how its enforcement methods may have failed to prevent Facebook and other online platforms from repeatedly engaging in deceptive privacy practices. \"From our perspective it highlights the need for a national privacy law,\" De Mooy says. \"It would ideally give more enforcement powers either to the FTC or to a new agency.\"","If the FTC finds that Facebook failed to comply with the consent decree it agreed to in 2011, it could be liable for trillions of dollars in fines, according to experts who spoke to The Washington Post. Violations of the agreement could carry a financial penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if the social network mishandled 50 million Americans' data, it could face fines up to $2 trillion. It's not clear though that the FTC would necessarily seek the maximum penalty—but even a fraction of that could put a strain even on as large a company as Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Those with a long memory will recall the networking joys of using the SixDegrees social network (as in Kevin Bacon), launched back in 1997. It allowed users to list friends and contacts, and invite them to join them in this new funky internet chatting area. At its peak SixDegrees boasted more than three million users.","This is nothing compared to Friends Reunited, which hit nearly 24 million users in 2010, or Friendster, which launched in 2002, underwent a gaming-focussed makeover in 2011, and hit a whopping 115 million users in the same year.","The historical daddy of social networks is of course MySpace. At its peak in 2008, MySpace also claimed 115 million monthly users. It is remember with enormous fondness for the crazy colour-funkiness of its pages, allowing any user to create all manner of migraine-inducing themes. It was hugely empowering and fun for people who just wanted to, um, express themselves. This was its great advantage, and ironically played a major part in its downfall. For in April of 2008, the younger, simpler, less eye-wincingly adaptable Facebook galloped right alongside MySpace, with an identical claim of 115 million users. From then on it never looked back, and of course we all know where we are now — 2.2 billion users by the end of 2017, which is like 63% of the entirety of the 3.5 billion users of the internet on the planet.","But where we are now is not where we were only a few weeks ago. Much has been made of the phenomenal rise of Facebook, of how it simplified and homogenised the whole act of what was then a nascent social networking experience; of how it struggled at first, and then mastered, the mobile experience, and of it’s smart and timely acquisitions that bolstered it further as it evolved. Early in it’s life it bought other, smaller, social networking platforms, such as FriendFeed. In 2010 it bought Friendster patents, and, oh look, in 2012 it acquired Instagram. In 2014 it secured WhatsApp and Oculus, and from then on a host of AI and audio/visual machine learning apps. This is intelligent, visionary purchasing, with an eye very much on the future. However its key to staying so relevant to both users and advertisers is in its use of data — billions of user preferences and comments and likes, feeding into algorithms that sort and feed and deliver in such a way that it can envelope you in a warm, fuzzy blanket of social connectedness.","This is perhaps why the revelations of recent days have been so damaging. It is no surprise that companies such as Cambridge Analytica seek to exploit user data and twist it for their own purposes. After recent bizarre election results in the US and otherwise, it perfectly fits that when this data is appropriated by other countries, troubling things can happen. In a world of social media new feeds and opinion polls and influencers, data is king. Yet Facebook’s reticence, and damning revelations that it, at best, looked the other way, is now making users and investors blink hard. $50 billion lost in the last two days — almost 10% of the entire value of the company. Zuckerberg called to account for the misuse of data by the UK Parliament. A whole raft of media outlets now explaining how to lock down the privacy settings, or even the likes of Brian Acton, founder of WhatsApp, declaring via Twitter that he is going to #deletefacebook. There is an irony in using one social media network to declare that he will delete another one; you would imagine that Twitter would be rubbings its hands. Yet Facebook is such a mega corp that the news is impact other tech stocks — they are all falling because investors seem spooked by (a) the misuse of the swathes of data that the likes of Google and Apple are holding, and (b) the anticipation of stricter regulation across the whole sector. GDPR officially starts in Europe on May 25th, bringing with it much tighter controls of data for any company that processes more than 250 data subjects, and putting power back into the hands of users. One can expect even more social-data-specific regulations, especially in the US, in the coming months. Today Zuckerberg acknowledged that a “breach of trust” between Facebook and its users had taken place, and announced plans to heavily audit and restrict the use of data on apps that plug into his platform. He did not explain why he waited nearly an entire week to respond to the public about the breach, nor whether any other miscreant companies misused data in a similar way.","The lesson here is that user data is, in fact, Big Data. The trivial facts of somebody’s life — the ones that they were previously quite happy to share with the big, free, social networks — are not quite so trivial any more. And people are starting to question whether they do actually want to share them at all. For that reason, Facebook should be very afraid."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

At the same time, GSR collected information on the test-takers' Facebook friends, building a database of tens of millions of user profiles. Facebook's policy allowed only collection of friends' data to improve the user experience, and barred this data from being sold or used for advertising. Unfortunately, Facebook never confirmed that data policies were followed, which they weren't.","Errant behavior like this strikes at the heart of big data stewardship and governance. It delivers a warning to enterprises engaged in big data (as almost all are) that the security and safekeeping of big data are every bit as important as they are for traditional data systems.","Unfortunately, most companies are ill-prepared for the kinds of security breaches and data compromises that threaten their big data on a daily basis.","What can chief data officers and big data project managers do to combat these growing big data security challenges?","1. Identify your business risk","Situations like the one Facebook finds itself in can damage your brand and your revenue-and it all started with lax big data governance and security practices. Although it is IT that implements the technologies to protect and prevent security and data breaches, none of this means very much if the CIO, CSO, and CDO can't explain in plain terms to the CEO and the board how a security breach that compromises documents containing vital customer information can harm your business. How do you discuss the topic in business risk terms? You say, \"A customer data breach will cause our customers to lose faith in our company and move to a competitor,\" not, \"A customer data breach will compromise our system and will take two days for IT to repair.\"","2. Get the right kind of help","One of the reasons organizations lag in their big data security is that many don't have the in-house security expertise, and it is difficult to find this expertise in the job market. If this sounds like your company's situation, don't get deterred by it. Instead, build the business case for bringing in outside consultative help, because hackers are working every day to compromise systems and steal information. You can't afford to wait.","3. Focus on social engineering","Much of Facebook's problem could have been avoided if someone in charge of the data had followed up to ensure that it was returned as agreed, and not given to others. This step wasn't followed—and it isn't clear as to what procedures and practices were in place to ensure that it would have been done. Possibly, employees inadvertently facilitated a data breach because they did not follow their data security practices. When the employees within your four walls are the culprits facilitating a data or security breach, social engineering (i.e., training your employees so they respect and execute appropriate security) is a major reason. This is why all companies should focus on documenting and training employees in appropriate data security practices. Periodically, refresher training in data security should also be given.","4. Emphasize prevention, not detection","Detection can help you identify threats once they've invaded your systems, but it's even better if you can prevent intrusions altogether. You can do this by screening incoming documents, emails and other forms of big data at the edges of your network-before you admit them into your central network and systems.","For more advice and tips, subscribe to our Big Data Insights newsletter.","Related Topics:","About Mary Shacklett","Mary E.

Here’s what experts have to say","How well the cybersecurity wall in India has shaped up and whether the government at the Centre has managed to secure its citizens' data or not?","Image Credit: Facebook&nbsp","Last week, all hell broke loose on the Internet when Facebook, which is one of the most used social media portals, was accused of sharing personal data of more than 50 million users with a British firm named Cambridge Analytica. Information of millions of users was said to be harvested in order to influence the results of 2016 US Presidential Elections as well as the Brexit referendum. But when it comes to India, while there was not much of a mention of the second most populated country in the world, there have been some reports that major Indian political parties were also clients of the British analytics firm.","This brings us to the question of how well has the cyber-security wall in India shaped up and whether the government at the Centre has managed to secure its citizens' data or not. Meanwhile, following the summons from the US Congress and from Europe, India has also warned FB CEO Mark Zuckerberg of \"stringent action\", including summoning him over the \"misuse\" of data to allegedly influence the country's electoral process.","According to top cyberlaw experts, India as a nation has missed the broader point in the ever-changing tech landscape.","\"The moot point here is: How do we regulate mobile app providers, social media players, and intermediaries in terms of handling and processing the users' data? We don't have a data protection law in place. We neither have a national law on cybersecurity nor a national law on privacy,\" Pavan Duggal, the nation's leading cyber law expert, told IANS. Also see: Facebook data breach: What went wrong and who is to blame?","The absence of these critical laws has created a very fertile ground for the misuse and unauthorised access of users' data by the service providers.","\"On top of it, India has not revisited its stand on intermediaries' liabilities since 2008. Also, the service providers have been given a great fillip by a judgment of the Supreme court, where the service providers are directed not to take any action till such time they get a court or a government agency order,\" Duggal informed.","In such a scenario, service providers are using the \"Indians' data with impunity\".","\"They are transferring them outside the territorial boundaries of the country because we as a nation are sleeping. Once the data goes outside the country, the government loses all control. This has a detrimental impact on the protection and preservation of people's data privacy and personal privacy,\" Duggal stressed.","The EU GDPR has been designed to harmonise data privacy laws across Europe -- to protect and empower all EU citizens' data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. After four years of debate, the GDPR was finally approved by the EU Parliament on April 14, 2016. Organisations that fail to comply with the new regulation will face hefty fines.","Although a white paper on data security has been published by the Indian government for all the stakeholders to deliberate upon, the country is still working on drafting a data protection bill. \"India is woefully under-prepared to address issues of data protection and cyber-security. We need a data protection law that protects citizens from misuse of data with strict liability and extremely high statutory damages that must be awarded within a strict period of time,\" said Mishi Choudhary, President, and Legal Director of New Delhi-based Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC.in), a not-for-profit organization.","According to Duggal, also a noted Supreme Court lawyer, India should not cut-paste any other country's law as it has to deal with a different set of problems. \"India's social realities are entirely different. The country has to deal with the huge issue of Aadhaar which is reeling under a variety of cyber attacks because we have failed to apply cybersecurity as an integral part of the Aadhaar architecture,\" Duggal told IANS. India's approach has to be based on its soil and the country must strive for data localization.","\"India should not allow its data to be stored outside its boundaries. Service providers must (be made to pay) high penalty if they are found to be misusing the data of Indians irrespective of if they are physically located in the country or not,\" Duggal said.","Is India even close to securing its citizens' data?

Kogan claims that the data he collected from thousands of Facebook users and their friends—amounting to data on over 50 million users—abided by Facebook’s terms; Cambridge Analytica promises it deleted the data; and Facebook is auditing everyone it can for signs of the data.","advertisement","advertisement","But while Facebook provided the original data, it wasn’t the only vehicle for Kogan’s app. Kogan acquired what he wanted from individual people—over 240,000 over a six-month period—recruiting them and paying them for their quiz answers and data using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk micro-work platform and Qualtrics, a survey platform.","The two platforms are often used by companies to conduct experiments and surveys and by academic researchers to, for instance, recruit psychology subjects. Research ethics require that scientists only gather people’s data for specified uses with their explicit consent, and Amazon’s polices prohibit tasks from harvesting people’s Facebook data.","At the time, multiple survey-takers took to a message board, Turkopticon, to report the quiz for violating of Amazon’s Terms of Service. The company eventually booted Kogan from its platform in 2015–over a year later–after learning from a Guardian article that he had passed the data to Cambridge Analytica.","But Kogan’s new company, Philometrics, continues to post questionnaires to Mechanical Turk, according to Turkopticon. Kogan’s collaborator on the Cambridge Analytica project, Joe Chancellor, also still uses the platform; according to one review website, he posted a task on Mechanical Turk in February.","Kogan, who remains a research associate in Cambridge University’s psychology department, and Chancellor, who now works at Facebook Research, did not respond to requests for comment.","Amazon wouldn’t provide more details, including how many people Kogan recruited on MTurk, or whether it attempted to notify those users after it learned of Cambridge Analytica’s role in 2015. “Sorry Cale, nothing more to add at this time,” the spokesperson said.","Qualtrics has not disclosed if it took any steps to review Kogan’s work. A spokesperson for the company said, “Qualtrics takes data privacy and security very seriously. Customers, not Qualtrics, own their data. All data are safeguarded using industry best security practices that prevent unlawful disclosure.”","How The Data Harvest Worked","In early 2014, Kogan, a lecturer at Cambridge University, cofounded a company, Global Science Research, for the purpose of working with Cambridge Analytica on a project to collect data on as many Americans as possible.","The personality quizzes–and the associated data-harvesting Facebook app–first appeared that spring on Mechanical Turk. MTurk, as it’s known, is an online marketplace where human workers (called “turkers”) can earn small amounts of money for completing individual “human intelligence tasks” (HITs)–like taking a survey and connecting it with your personal Facebook profile. Kogan and Chancellor also turned to the survey platform Qualtrics, spending around $800,000 to pay users who took their quizzes (and turned over their data), according to the New York Times.","Generally, the task offered to pay turkers $1 to $2 dollars apiece once they completed the quiz and handed over access to their Facebook data. Technically, neither MTurk nor Qualtrics allow integrations that let survey respondents connect to users’ Facebook data. It’s likely, however, that Kogan recruited users using these platforms and then sent them a link to the external Facebook app, which then connected him with Facebook’s Open API.","[Screenshot: Turkopticon]From a base of approximately 270,000 users, Kogan took advantage of a then-widely used feature in the Facebook API, which allowed him to harvest data from their friends too; by the time the project was finished, over 50 million users’ data had been downloaded, with over 34 million profiles “usable” for psychometric research. Facebook would completely close access to friends’ data in May 2015.","advertisement","Attached to one of the tasks it sent out in 2014, Global Science Research and Cambridge Analytica added a few specific requirements.","First, GSR and Cambridge Analytica were only interested in Americans. Second, “turkers” wouldn’t be paid until they authorized the Facebook app to “…give us permission to download some data from your Facebook. We will download (a) some of your demographic data, (b) your likes, (c) your friend’s list, (d) whether each of your friends knows one another, (e) the likes of your friends and their demographics, and (f) some of your private messages…” (Research shows the average Facebook user then had about 340 friends.)","Not long after the surveys started to appear, a few of the “turkers” began to realize that the Global Science Research app was taking advantage of Facebook’s gray data supply chain. “Someone can learn everything about you by looking at hundreds of pics, messages, friends, and likes,” warned one “turker.”","“Advertising or marketing activities, including HITs requiring registration at another website or group”","“Posting HITs on behalf of third parties without our prior written consent”","On Turkopticon, Kogan has more than a hundred reviews for various tasks, posted both by his account, from at least February 2014 to May 2014, and by his company’s account, from June 2014 to December 2015.","But in February 2014 and again in May 2014, a flurry of negative reviews reported that Kogan had violated the Amazon Turk Terms of Service. In May 2014 one user wrote:","advertisement","After 15 minutes of working on the survey –answering all the questions and then providing my demographic data — the survey then asks to access my Facebook account by having me log in collecting personal identifiable information… This is against AMT policy, which includes:","“collecting personal identifiable information” as an example of a prohibited activity.","Also, the survey was carelessly done, which makes me believe it’s all a setup to collect information about a person for really cheap.","At least nine people on the message board reported Kogan and Global Science Research for violating Amazon’s rules. But he continued posting various research surveys until December 2015, when Amazon said it banned him from the platform.","After recent reporting by The Guardian and The Times, Facebook banned Kogan and Cambridge Analytica from its platform pending an investigation. The company said Kogan previously claimed that the data his app was scraping was being used for academic purposes.","Kogan, who has agreed to an audit, has said that Facebook “at no point raised any concerns at all” about the app or an updated description of it that detailed its commercial, rather than academic, use. He also said that when Facebook asked him to delete the data in 2015, he did. Kogan told the BBC last week that he was “being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.”","Offloading Responsibility","Rochelle LaPlante, an MTurk worker and advocate, said the scandal highlighted issues with the way Amazon addressed abuse on its platform. Amazon, she said, doesn’t thoroughly check out the people who recruit turkers, instead relying on people like her to turn in those whose tasks go against the platform’s terms of service, she said.","“This puts responsibility onto individual workers to be familiar enough with the Terms of Service that the platform requesters must agree to,” she told Fast Company over email. “It relies on workers to know what to report and when, and to take on the labor of sending these reports to Amazon.”","What’s more, says LaPlante, Amazon rarely gives Turkers feedback about reports they have submitted or follow up on them in any way, “so we never know if our reports are read or if action is taken or how quickly (or not) any of that happens.” In regards to Kogan, LaPlante wonders why he was able to make multiple MTurk accounts and continue posting requests for work even after he was initially terminated.","How many others, like Kogan, have used these freelancer platforms for this kind of participation—and this kind of data harvesting—in exchange for a small compensation? One user on the subreddit MTurk writes about Cambridge Analytica, “This firm definitely isn’t unique and I’m sure there are worse abusers that will never get noticed.”","LaPlante says there are many tasks on MTurk that ask for people to log into Facebook, or something similar. And it’s difficult to know exactly where that data is going.","“These are clear violations of the MTurk Terms of Service and we report them to Amazon when we see them. But again, we have no way on the worker side to know if Amazon ever takes action against those,” she says. “If the researcher is suspended for a TOS violation, it’s quite possible the researcher still gets their project completed before Amazon gets around to taking a look at the reports, since popular HITs are often done within a few hours (or less).”","LaPlante said the company needs to be more transparent, echoing calls increasingly heard around Silicon Valley and the data industry. “I do wonder why we have yet to see a recent statement from Amazon about their involvement,” says LaPlante","There are many questions that still surround the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica controversy, and many lessons too. Among them: If tech companies can’t police themselves, they must share more of their internal data with researchers, journalists, and the public. It’s a demand that people have been making of Facebook and other companies for years, with varying and mostly dismal success. If they want to maintain the integrity of their platforms–and their users’ trust–any company that helps to amplify the misuse of our data will need to find ways to turn over some of their own data too."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Allegations of data being sent overseas, without consent, to a US company reek of what happened in the US and the UK last week.","When grey areas in data science meet political innuendo, the results can be incendiary in the age of real-time social media. So what are we to make out, as some engaged digital-age activists are saying, of a society that loves to share personal data but does not like it to be unsafe?","File image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PTI.","Last week, I had said half in jest that 'consent has moved from sex to data'. Truth is that both are separately important, but last week at least, the public focus was more on Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's beleaguered CEO, than on disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein or even President Donald Trump, whose sexual misdemeanours are hogging headlines the world-over.","Given that we are entering an election year in India, mutual swipes and wild accusations by the Congress, the AAP and the BJP on use or abuse of data is bound to go up. We are also faced with the unique situation where Google and Facebook, friends of the Election Commission up until yesterday for their awesome reach into Indian voter minds, are suddenly becoming unwanted wannabe spies. One piece of bad news is enough.","Now take a deep breath. Apps — be it of Facebook or Narendra Modi — are meant to gather data. Targeted content, sales offers and advertisements are part of the official business models of Google, Amazon and Facebook. All of a sudden, there are three hard issues at stake: unethical use of profiling; use of such profiling to mislead people into voting (you can call it data-based ambush); and the presence or alleged interference of foreign powers in a scenario of a globally connected social network.","In India, the harsh ground reality is that we are being forced to leapfrog into a Big Brother syndrome and deal with it. Laws are yet to catch up with reality. It's a bit like someone discovering the joys of sex being suddenly informed that there is also such a thing called a sexually transmitted disease.","The Supreme Court (SC), which is still hearing a case on whether the Aadhaar unique ID breaches the rights of citizens in terms of data protection, safety and freedom, passed a verdict on the right to privacy less than a year ago.","Data protection was a key issue in the software industry a year ago when business process outsourcing (BPO) companies were targeted by trade unions and protectionists in Europe as violative of data privacy. Too much has happened across the globe since then, including in India.","The country does not yet have a real law in place for data protection. Only contract laws and the Information Technology Act of 2000 are in place and a real data protection law is still in the works. The Justice Srikrishna committee, which is drafting a proposed data protection framework, began its public consultation process with an open house only two months ago.","It is time perhaps for the Supreme Court to pronounce a quick view on the subject and for the Srikrishna panel to push out an early set of data hygiene guidelines, so that those already thriving in the grey areas or caught on the wrong side of an emerging discipline can quickly learn and act in the interest of national consensus. Political mudslinging has found a new platform in data hygiene but it is best for us to ignore the noise and focus on real safety and protection.","And while at that, it would be a good idea to have a Lokpal for data -- some kind of a 'go-to' data ombudsman with credibility and political neutrality who can issue quick pronouncements to block out the emerging noise. It is best done with some constitutional validity, as an ombudsman friendly to the government can only be viewed with suspicion. Given the way India's courts are burdened with cases, it is too much to expect a creaking judiciary to talk in detail just as more cases pile up.","Note:The Congress pulled its 'With INC' app off all OS stores on Monday"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Facebook, according to the reports, did little to protect the data from abuse. President Donald Trump’s former chief adviser, Steve Bannon, is a former vice president of the company, and Trump’s campaign director for his 2020 re-election campaign, Brad Parscale, worked closely with Cambridge Analytica in 2016 to boost Trump’s digital operations.","In a secretly recorded meeting with Channel 4 News’ fake client, Nix suggested secretly entrapping politicians and then exposing them for political gain.","“Deep digging is interesting, but you know, equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true, and make sure that that’s video recorded,” he said. “These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption and putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”","Nix said he could use “somebody posing as a wealthy developer” offering a bribe in exchange for land in order to entrap a political opponent.","“Send some girls around to the candidate’s house,” he added. “We have lots of history of things.”","“We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know,” he said later, noting separately: “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done, what has been done.”","Later in the meeting, Nix emphasized: “I mean, it sounds a dreadful thing to say, but these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true, as long as they’re believed.”","The company’s representatives also discussed ways to keep their involvement in campaigns hidden from the public.","“It may be that we have to contract under a different name,” Turnbull said at one point. “A different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.”","“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” Nix said separately. “So often we set up, if we are working then we can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists, there’s so many options we can look at. I have lots of experience in this.”","Finally, the report highlighted, Turnbull claimed to have experience working with ex-spies working for “British companies” and “Israeli companies,” the latter of which he called “very effective in intelligence gathering.”","“We just used a different organization to run a very, very successful project in a eastern European country where no-one even knew they were there,” he said. “They just ghosted in, did the work, ghosted out, and produced really, really good material.”","A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica told Channel 4 News: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever… We routinely undertake conversations with prospective clients to try to tease out any unethical or illegal intentions…”","The spokesperson added: “Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”"],"isopubdate":""}

By that measure, a potential case against Amazon, with its reputation for lowering prices in markets it enters, is less likely.","The Federal Trade Commission quickly gave its blessing to Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market, an indication that the company was far from triggering serious antitrust concerns.","“I’m deeply skeptical that a plaintiff could prove anti-competitive behavior” by Amazon under current law, based on what’s publicly known about the company, said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School and a former Justice Department antitrust official.","“Bottom line, show me the beef,” he added. “If you have any specific wrongdoing you’re alleging about Amazon, show that.”","The president’s critiques also echo criticism of Amazon’s tax practices. The company for years sought to avoid sales taxes charged by brick-and-mortar competitors, relying on a Supreme Court ruling that exempted from taxes any mail-order sellers and internet businesses that had no physical presence in a jurisdiction.","The tax issue has faded a bit since Amazon began collecting sales taxes nationwide on purchases from its own inventory, though some loopholesremain.","Trump’s bluster directed at Amazon doesn’t appear to have filtered to cabinet officials, some of whom seem to maintain a cordial public relationship with the retailer.

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan's data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\"","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign.","Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","\"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.","Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller's investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel's investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.","Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The prevalence and impact of fake news are also becoming a question of concern for political campaigners, journalists, government officials, and companies like Google.","But observers now say there’s a concerted attempt at spreading misinformation and to perhaps sway public opinion. As the campaigns have gotten underway, there has been an increase in the number of attack ads appearing online, besides the manufacturing of falsehoods disguised as news material. Some users on Kenya’s social media networks have also blamed some of the misinformation on Cambridge Analytica, a company at the center of a growing controversy over the use of data mining and psychological profiling to influence both the Brexit vote in the UK and the Donald Trump election in the US.","“It seems as if there’s a drive, a deliberate effort to create fake stories,” Catherine Gicheru, the Kenya head for the data journalism and civic technology initiative, Code for Africa, said.","Deliberate spreading of false information is now a core part of the news mix in Kenya, according to a study which revealed 90% of Kenyans had heard or seen false stories related to the election, with a cross section of the population including official groups, friends, and families all using social media to spread misinformation. The study, by Portland and GeoPoll, had asked a sample of 2,000 Kenyans about their consumption of news related to the upcoming polls.","So called fake news and misinformation has been a significant problem in recent years around the world especially as more and more people look to social media for their news and information. The election of Donald Trump to the presidency of the United States led to a lot of soul-searching, not least of which by the world’s largest social network, Facebook which also owns WhatsApp.","In the US, Facebook has beenrepeatedlyaccused of facilitating and magnifying an ecosystem of websites that spread false information and conspiracy theories across the platform. That criticism led Facebook to announce late last year that it would be collaborating with “third-party fact checking organizations” to identify stories that don’t hold up to scrutiny, and warn users when they try to post these stories.","In Kenya, the problem is elevated by the levels of connectivity among voters. Mobile phone subscriptions stand at 39 million lines among Kenya’s 45 million people. The country also has the 14th fastest mobile internet speed in the world, with as much as 88% of the population accessing the internet through their phones—thanks in large part to cheap data plans and the ubiquity of mobile money platforms like M-Pesa. Social media is also big in Kenya not to mention the over 15,000 registered bloggers in the east African nation.","Almost 50% of those polled said they used social media to access and share news about the election. But despite their pervasiveness, respondents didn’t fully trust information shared on networks like Facebook and WhatsApp. Mainstream media outlets like television, newspapers, and radio were rated as more trustworthy sources.","Analysts have labeled the spread of information on these messaging apps as “dark social,” given that their effect cannot be measured or questioned publicly. Government officials in Kenya are also closely watching chatter on these apps, recently accusing the managers of 21 WhatsApp groups of spreading hate.

By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app. The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users — and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so-called psychometric profiles of American voters, setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain.","In his testimony before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, (Cambridge Analytica whistleblower) Wylie had claimed that they had several meetings with Palantir and that the firm had informal access to the Kogan data.","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” he said. “That was not an official contract between Palantir and CA, but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data. And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.”","Wylie said that Alexander Nix, the chief executive of SCL, was interested in Palantir’s work and that when he joined SCL, one of the first emails he received was asking him about Palantir.","Of course, Thiel’s company, Palantir, now claims that the employee was working “in an entirely personal capacity”, which is total B.S. — before today, they were claiming that there was zero contact between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica.","And by the way, guess who was an original investor in Facebook...Peter Thiel.

I am not a cool person,” said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of the social-media giant, in 2014. That has never been more true. His company has spent the past year stumbling through controversies over the peddling of fake news and enabling Russian manipulation of American voters, with various degrees of ineptitude. Then, on March 17th, articles in the New York Times and Britain’s Observer newspaper suggested that a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had obtained detailed data about some 50m Facebook users and shared this trove of information and analysis with third parties, including Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The result is a corporate crisis—and a political reckoning.","Republicans and Democrats alike have called on Mr Zuckerberg and the heads of other tech firms to testify before the Senate. America’s consumer watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), has also reportedly launched an investigation into Facebook’s privacy policies and whether it violated a consent decree of 2011 requiring the social network to notify users about how their data are shared. British MPs have called for Mr Zuckerberg to come before a select committee.","Even Facebook’s allies have unfriended it. On Twitter, Brian Acton, a co-founder of the popular messaging app WhatsApp (which Facebook bought for $22bn in 2014), encouraged people to “#DeleteFacebook”. News of his post pinged around the internet, including on Facebook itself. Investors, who have forgiven months of bad headlines in light of Facebook’s strong financial performance, are growing jittery. Between March 16th and March 21st the firm’s share price fell by 8.5%, erasing $45bn in market value. Facebook is still the world’s eighth-most-valuable publicly listed firm, but shareholders worry that politicians in Europe and America may impose onerous restrictions on data, suppressing growth.","Help yourself to our data","The Cambridge Analytica scandal reveals Facebook’s morphing, porous privacy policies and the company’s cavalier approach to oversight. The data on Facebook users were obtained by Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge University, who enticed some 270,000 people to take part in a survey in exchange for a small fee. When those users installed the survey app, they shared details about themselves and—unwittingly—their friends, around 50m Facebook users in all. Surprisingly, before 2015 Facebook’s rules allowed the mining of social connections without each user’s consent.","What happened next was never permitted by Facebook. Mr Kogan provided these data to Cambridge Analytica, which then allegedly shared them with customers, including Mr Trump’s campaign. Cambridge Analytica is backed by Robert Mercer, a Republican donor; Steve Bannon, formerly a top adviser to Mr Trump, used to serve as an executive. (The Economist used Cambridge Analytica for a market-research project in the past.)","Although news of Cambridge Analytica’s peddling of Facebook data was first reported in December 2015, the social network reportedly did not respond until eight months later, with a letter asking the firm to delete the data. It seems not to have checked that this was done. The lax response is evidence of wider “systemic operational problems”, says Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research, who follows the firm.","If reports are to be believed, Cambridge Analytica has a habit of pushing ethical and legal boundaries to gather data. On March 20th Alexander Nix, its chief executive, was suspended after recordings were aired on British television that seem to capture him describing manipulating people for information. Britain’s data-protection regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office, is expected to search Cambridge Analytica’s offices.","The scandal reverberates through politics as well as the internet. Facebook has built a mammoth advertising business, with sales of around $40bn in 2017, by gathering detailed information about users’ identities and behaviour online and then selling access to them. Facebook tracks users not only on its services, including its eponymous social network and Instagram (which it owns), but across the web. Knowing that someone is a dog owner and interested in buying a new lead may not seem controversial. “Microtargeting” someone in order to influence their political views and voting behaviour appears more sinister.","Though political advertising is still a minuscule percentage of Facebook’s revenues, perhaps around 3%, it is a growing and lucrative line. Politicians have found that using Facebook can pay dividends. Even without using illegitimately obtained data to boost targeting, the social-media firm offers precise tools to political campaigns, including reaching users on Facebook whose names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses they already have. Facebook also enables campaigns to target voters who show an interest in the same issues or have similar profiles, packaging them into what it calls “lookalike audiences”. No other Western company apart from Google has such rich data.","Barack Obama’s campaigns were digitally sophisticated and used Facebook to reach prospective voters. Yet Mr Obama got proper permission to obtain data about people’s friends and did not microtarget users on an industrial scale, unlike Mr Trump’s campaign. Targeting based on Cambridge Analytica’s data may have helped Mr Trump win the presidency, although how much cannot be known.","A tepid response","Companies can overcome scandals. Rupert Murdoch, a media mogul, survived a maelstrom in 2011 when it was reported that a newspaper he owned had hacked the phone of a murdered girl, Milly Dowler. Mr Zuckerberg, like Mr Murdoch, has structured ownership of his firm so that he controls super-voting shares, and will probably maintain his power. But there is speculation that some of his lieutenants, including Sheryl Sandberg, could leave in the next year. The head of security, Alex Stamos, is expected to resign.","Mr Zuckerberg’s response to the scandal has been modest. He has apologised and promised thorough audits of third-party app developers and steps to make it easier for users to control their privacy settings. Such basic assurances may not be enough to reverse flagging corporate morale and win back the enthusiasm of users. Trust in social media is already low, and Americans have been spending less time on Facebook, in part because so much of what they see online is negative and dubious. Globally, users spent around 50m hours less per day on Facebook in the fourth quarter of 2017, which translates into a 15% drop in time spent year over year, according to Mr Wieser.","As some users turn away, politicians in America and Europe are likely to give Facebook more of their attention. They are scrutinising Facebook’s conduct and may propose new laws, especially in the domain of data privacy. In May regulations concerning data protection and user consent will come into effect in Europe. America has historically been weak on data protection, except for specific industries like health care. Overworked regulators have typically responded to reports of misconduct on a case-by-case basis, and the online advertising industry has been trusted to police itself.","Mr Obama was in favour of a consumer-privacy bill of rights, which would give users more control of their online data by requiring user consent. That made little headway because of opposition from the industry. Some politicians may want to revive talk of such a law, especially as Europe strengthens its safeguards. But political reformers seldom have an easy time in America. And, like many others, politicians have come to rely on Facebook.","This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \"The antisocial network\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.\"","Stamos advocated investigating and revealing manipulation of news at the social network by Russian entities, to the chagrin of other top executives, the Times reported, citing unnamed current and former employees.","Profiles weaponized?","Senator Ron Wyden asked Facebook to provide more information on what he called a \"troubling\" misuse of private data that could have been used to sway voters.","Wyden said he wants to know how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook tools \"to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.\"","In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage.","Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations \"horrifying, if confirmed,\" and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week.","According to a joint investigation by The New York Times and Britain's Observer, Cambridge Analytica was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's Information Commissioner who regulates the sector in the country, announced her office would seek a court warrant on Tuesday to search Cambridge Analytica's computer servers.","She said the company had been \"uncooperative\" to requests for access to its records and missed a Monday deadline stipulated.","Meanwhile, Facebook said it has hired a digital forensics firm to examine how the data leak occurred and to ensure that any data collected had been destroyed.","Facebook shares skidded 6.8 percent by the close of the Nasdaq amid concerns about pressure for new regulations that could hurt its business model.","Shares slipped another percent or so to $170 in after-market trades.","'Self-regulation not working'","Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media, said the disclosures will increase pressure to regulate Facebook and other social media firms, already under scrutiny for allowing disinformation from Russian-directed sources to propagate.","\"Self-regulation is not working,\" Grygiel said.","Daniel Kreiss, a professor of media and communications at the University of North Carolina, said Facebook failed to live up to its responsibilities on election ads.","\"The fact that Facebook seems to make no distinction between selling sneakers and selling a presidential platform is a deep problem,\" Kreiss said.","Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research maintained that the revelations highlight \"systemic problems at Facebook,\" but that they won't immediately impact the social network's revenues.","David Carroll, a media professor at the Parsons School of Design, said Facebook and others will soon be forced to live with new privacy rules such as those set to take effect in the European Union.","\"Facebook and Google will have to ask users a lot more permission to track them,\" Carroll said. \"Most people are going to say no, so I think it's going to have a huge impact on these companies.\"","Carroll has filed a legal action in Britain calling on Cambridge Analytica to disclose what data was gathered and used on him.","An undercover investigation of Cambridge Analytica by Britain's Channel 4 said executives boasted they could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and Ukrainian sex workers, and spread misinformation online.","The executives claimed to have worked in more 200 elections across the world, including Argentina, the Czech Republic, India, Kenya and Nigeria.","The British firm said it \"strongly denies\" the claims from Channel 4 as well as reports on misuse of Facebook data.","\"Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign,\" a statement read."],"isopubdate":""}

In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.”","The company’s response to the Ars Technica story, however, struck a different tone, with Facebook titling the post “Fact Check: Your Call and SMS History.” It said “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,” before going on to explain that call and text history logging is included with an opt-in feature on Messenger or Facebook Lite for Android that “people have to expressly agree to use” and that they can turn off at any time, which would also delete any call and text data shared with that app.","Ars Technica has already amended its original post with a response to Facebook’s statement, saying it contradicts several of its findings, including the experience of users who shared their data with the publication.","“In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used,” wrote Ars Technica IT and national security editor Sean Gallagher in the amendment to his post. “Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.”","In its statement, Facebook said “Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with. This was first introduced in Messenger in 2015, and later offered as an option in Facebook Lite, a lightweight version of Facebook for Android.”","When people first sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android or log into Messenger on an Android device, they see a screen giving them the option to continuously upload contacts as well as call and text history. Facebook added that on Messenger, users are then given three options: to turn the feature on, “learn more” for more information or “not now” to skip it. On Facebook Lite, they get two options: turn it on or skip. If users who opted in change their minds later, Facebook said they could turn it off in the app’s settings, with the option of turning off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled or deleting all contact information they’ve uploaded from that app.”","An image included with Facebook’s statement.","Facebook emphasized in bold text that it “never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.”","Even though the opt-in screens do state that granting permission will “continuously upload info” about contacts and call and text history, it is arguable that many users don’t really understand what that means and that instead of saying “this lets friends find each other on Facebook and helps us create a better experience for everyone” (a message sweetened with a saccharine cartoon of a figure texting a little heart), Facebook should really be giving more details about what exactly will be recorded and why.","With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still fresh on everyone’s minds, Facebook’s apparent willingness to place the onus for protecting personal data on users who already feel victimized is unlikely to help them regain any goodwill. But even people who truly understand the implications of the feature and chose to opt-in anyway did so assuming that their data would be guarded as Facebook promised. As the Cambridge Analytica fiasco threw into sharp relief, that hasn’t always been the case."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Meanwhile, a New York Times story published Saturday claims the firm siphoned off information from the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission.","Despite Cambridge assuring Facebook the data were deleted - Facebook eventually received reports that the data was never disposed of.","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","Cambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix once boasted that his firm had collected as many as 5,000 data points on the 270 million likely American voters - a staggering number, according to Mother Jones.","Looking back, that admission may have been ill-advised: Cambridge Analytica is now embroiled in a lawsuit over whether they need to turn over the data they've collected on individual voters should those voters request it. This threatens to pull back the curtain on methods that the company used to help Trump win - including the rumored use of a technique called psychographics. Psychographics is a groundbreaking data-analysis technique that sounds like something adapted from a bad science-fiction novel.","Cambridge Analytica opened its doors in 2013 and claims to use big data to predict human behavior and influence political elections, according to the company’s website. But what sets Cambridge Analytica apart from other data firms is that it claims to use what’s known as psychographics to build its voter profiles. Many political campaigns have used demographics (e.g., age, race, gender) to target political messaging, and President Obama successfully and famously used consumer data to target voters. But psychographics, in theory, go deeper, claiming to be able to predict a voter’s personality traits, such as how organized, extroverted, or quick to worry they are, by looking at a person’s online and consumer behavior.","Representatives of the company have since tried to walk this back:","To add, even Cambridge Analytica itself is sending mixed messages about the use of psychographics on the Trump campaign. Nix said in that same fall 2016 presentation, “Of the two candidates left in the election, one of them is using these technologies,” referring to Trump. Then, at a December post-election panel hosted by Google, Matt Oczkowski, Cambridge’s head of product, said “I don’t want to break your heart; but we actually didn’t really do any psychographics with the Trump campaign.”","Cambridge Analytica said it's in touch with Facebook in order to resolve the matter as quickly as possible​, according to a company statement on Saturday.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the statement said.","The suspension comes as CA is embroiled in a lawsuit, brought by David Carroll, a media professor at Parsons School of Design, over whether it must turn over the data it has collected on American voters when they request it. While there are no US laws requiring this, CA, being a UK company, is subject to UK laws, that mandate disclosure.","Still, critics of CA have sought to portray the firm as a purveyor of psychological warfare that has actively tried to interfere in international elections. The company has been forced to repeatedly deny allegations that it conspired with Russia to sway the US election in favor of Trump - allegations that surfaced after it was revealed that Nix, the founder of CA, had offered Julian Assange help in releasing Hillary Clinton's stolen emails."],"isopubdate":""}

Heck, even Mark Zuckerberg himself believes Facebook is about bringing the world closer together. In some ways this is absolutely true. I for one have seen that as I’ve built a conscious media and education outlet over the last 9 years that reaches hundreds of millions all over the world.","I intuitively reported late last year that Facebook would be under heavy fire in 2018 as they struggle to find what the point of their platform is beyond surveillance and money. Here we are seeing it already.","Since the 2016 presidential election ended and Hillary lost in what was a shocking result to many, ‘fake news’ and censorship on Facebook has become so strong I’m not even sure it’s the same platform it once was. Not only that, it appears that meaningless, and often useless, content and conjecture is about all that fills users newsfeeds these days. What happened?","Edward Snowden weighed in on what he feels Facebook is, and always has been: a surveillance company.","Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims. They are accomplices. https://t.co/mRkRKxsBcw","Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as “surveillance companies.” Their rebranding as “social media” is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.","Is he right? The story goes that Facebook started out in colleges and universities as a way to keep students in touch with one another. It then opened to the general public and became a massive source of communication, information sharing and connection. Then Facebook went public.","The moment this happened Facebook’s new priority was making money for its share holders, and upholding whatever political pressure they had to abide by given their obvious connections with intelligence communities. Data is a huge business, for both companies and intelligence agencies.","With the need for constant financial growth, Facebook began to strip the value it provided on its platform, connecting people with information, and replaced it with a newsfeed that would produce as much income as possible. The problem with this is, Facebook no longer became a tool of connection and instead became a massive advertising platform.","How did they do it? They had all the data they ever needed as people were freely giving it up, and Facebook had its many ways of eerily collecting it.","Facebook The Only One?","It has been said by many close to the company that Facebook’s agendas go far beyond simply a social media network connecting people. Facebook’s former vice president of user growth stated Facebook was “ripping society apart.” Ex Facebook chief Sean Parker said Facebook was built to exploit people’s weaknesses.","But apparently it isn’t just Facebook in this game, it’s Google, YouTube and other SM networks too. Julian Assange discusses the close relationships between Google and the NSA in his 2014 book: When Google Met WikiLeaks","Around the same time, Google was becoming involved in a program known as the “Enduring Security Framework” (ESF), which entailed the sharing of information between Silicon Valley tech companies and Pentagon-affiliated agencies “at network speed.” Emails obtained in 2014 under Freedom of Information requests show Schmidt and his fellow Googler Sergey Brin corresponding on first-name terms with NSA chief General Keith Alexander about ESF Reportage on the emails focused on the familiarity in the correspondence: “General Keith . . . so great to see you . . . !” Schmidt wrote. But most reports overlooked a crucial detail. “Your insights as a key member of the Defense Industrial Base,” Alexander wrote to Brin, “are valuable to ensure ESF’s efforts have measurable impact.” –Julian Assange","What To Take From This","It isn’t that any of these platforms are inherently evil, I truly believe it’s a ‘lazy’ way to think and attempt to understand people and things when we simply call them evil or other hateful terms. Discussion marginalized to that level means we don’t want to understand why, therefore we don’t want to actually solve the issue we just want to complain about it.","We are in a time where humanity is being challenged to ‘grow up’ in a sense. I feel that means usherhing ourselves into full individual responsibility for the nature of world and choosing to individually do something about it.","Show we use these platforms? use them as you see fit but I always raise the question about how we are choosing to use them and reflecting on how we feel as we use them in certain ways. Are we putting information out that we wouldn’t want others seeing, knowing and collecting? Are we chasing likes and the feeling of approval from others? Are we comparing ourselves to others via these platforms? Or are these platforms serving us to stay informed or connected to others and information in an effective way?","Things are what they are, we can choose to use them and engage in whatever way suits us. No judgement necessary.","In Brief","The Facts:","Child trafficking goes far beyond the sexual abuse of children. As Robert David Steele explains, it deals with torture, ritual abuse, organ harvesting and much more. It's a big issue that needs more awareness, and the ITNJ is taking action.","Reflect On:","How did we get to the point where our 'leaders' in the most powerful positions are involved in such things? Is it appropriate to continue having them occupy high-ranking positions? Should we be supporting them? Processing our emotions is key.","Robert David Steele is a former Marine, CIA case officer and the co-founder of the US Marine Corps Intelligence Activity. His mission has been to spread the use of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), and he’s written a number of handbooks on OSINT for NATO, the DIA and US Special Operations Forces.","He has been working in these fields for decades, and definitely knows a thing or two about what’s going on at the deepest levels of government and the military industrial complex. These are the people we have to start listening to for truth. He won’t get an interview on CNN, that’s for sure.","Lately, he’s been one of several credible people from ‘within’ creating awareness and speaking out about issues that mainstream media continues to ignore, who sometimes goes as far to label as a ‘conspiracy theory,’ no matter how much evidence sits behind the claims. One of these issues is child trafficking and abuse, a topic that’s gained a lot of attention since the 2016 American election as high ranking members of the global elite have been implicated in such activity, and have been implicated in such activity for a very long time.","Only now are we seeing it creep up into the mainstream narrative, despite the fact that they continually try and shut it down. Why? Because the owners and shareholders of these networks have been implicated in the activity discussed in this article.","Beyond Simple Abuse","In the video below, Robert gives a very brief outline of the issue, and how child trafficking goes far beyond the abuse of children. It goes into organ harvesting, children being bred for ritual abuse, born without a birth certificate, tortured, enslaved, mind-controlled and a much more.","Again, this information is hitting the mainstream like it never has before, one example would be the fact that an NBC news report implicated Hillary Clinton in covering up a massive pedophile ring in the heart of the State Department, another would be multiple ex-high ranking political officials claiming that both the Clinton’s engage in sex with minors, pointing towards their close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein (who also has Royal Family connections).","Epstein is now a registered sex offender. When it comes to the Vatican, there are always disturbing acts going on. Right now, the Pope’s right-hand man, George Pell, is in court for sexual assault, and a massive pedophile ring has been exposed where hundreds of boys were tortured and sexually abused, Pope Benedict’s brother was at the forefront of that controversy.","As far as the military industrial complex goes, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney grilled Donald Rumsfeld on DynCorp about a private military contractor with ties to the trafficking of women and children. Years later, a top U.S. General who was the liaison between DynCorp and the U.S. Military was implicated in the sexual assault of teenaged girls. The list goes on and on, and it’s a long one. Oh yeah, let’s not forget about PizzaGate…","Individuals from within governments like former U.S. State Department official, Steve Pieczeni, have also been very outspoken on the subject of elite pedophile rings, and who is involved.","As Steele mentions below, ‘powerful’ organizations, like intelligence agencies for example, are not all ‘bad.’ He claims that they are filled with 90 percent good people, with good hearts and good intentions, and that the 10 percent that controls these areas are wrapped up in in-humane activity, like child trafficking.","Give the video below a listen to learn more, and you can check out more testimony from the International Tribunal on Natural Justice from others like Robert, police officers, MK Ultra survivors and many more who have knowledge of such activity.","Why Are We Learning About This?","This information can seem ‘dark’ and ‘grim,’ but how are we helping the situation if we completely ignore it and pretend it isn’t happening? It’s one thing to present this information with great judgment and anger, pushing us into a state of being and emotion that keeps us locked into lower frequencies, but it’s another thing all together to present it as neutral facts that we can become aware of so we can begin to make way for more survivors, whistleblowers and witnesses come forward to share their testimony.","When this happens, action starts to take place, like what we are seeing at the ITNJ. So, if you want to know what to do with this information, share it, and help be the voice for those who still don’t have one. Process any emotions that come from learning this information. This is how we will move through the states of consciousness that project a world that keeps this type of stuff occurring. Evolving beyond the need for it, is often about switching our perspective about it and processing the emotions.","In Brief","Robert Bigelow, founder of the Bigelow Aerospace Corporation lets the world know that he has knowledge that we are not alone, and that we are currently being visited by intelligent extraterrestrials.","Reflect On:","Bigelow is just one person, but he is joined by hundreds of others with impressive credentials. These people have been telling the world that we are not alone for years, in a very serious manner. Why do you think this is considered a 'conspiracy?'","“We have, indeed, been contacted – perhaps even visited – by extraterrestrial beings, and the US government, in collusion with the other national powers of the Earth, is determined to keep this information from the general public.” – Victor Marchetti, former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (Second Look, Volume 1, No 7, Washington, DC, May 1979)","If you’re paying attention to what’s happening in the world, it’s OK if you feel like Alice in Wonderland. For years humanity has become comfortable with their enslavement, prior to today, a large portion of the population was content with the human experience, simply entering into the system, trying to put food on the table and chase higher ‘material’ status, among other things, without ever questioning what is really happening. All of us have been engulfed in our own lives when the world is calling for us to be concerned about others.","Today, it’s a different story. There’s a massive shift in consciousness that’s occurring, and part of that shift is questioning the human experience and the systems we’ve chosen to surround ourselves with. Revelations are now coming forth in all areas that surround every aspect of human life; health and finance, to education, politics, entertainment etc… It’s quite clear that our world is not what we’ve all been presented with, and that there are aspects of reality that we should really start paying attention to if we want to grow, move forward, and break out of the cycle we currently find ourselves in. We can’t change our world if we continue to do the same things over and over again without questioning what’s happening, and why it’s happening. There are people in all fields coming forth to ‘blow the whistle,’ and witness testimony is backed up by credible evidence, which gives these whistle-blowers confidence to come forward and say what they say. Edward Snowden is one of many great examples, prior to him, mass surveillance was considered another ‘conspiracy theory.’","One big revelation hitting the mainstream right now is the fact that we are not alone, and that intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms have been visiting our planet for a long time, and still do. As unbelievable as this may sound, it comes from the highest ranking military personnel, academicians, intelligence agents, politicians, and private contractors from within the military industrial complex. There are hundreds of these people who keep telling the world that we are being visited and that governments around the world have had evidence that some of these ‘UFOs’ are indeed extraterrestrial.","“Yes, it’s both. It’s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and it’s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. And so the phenomenon stretches us, or it asks us to stretch to open to realities that are not simply the literal physical world, but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen realities from which our consciousness, our, if you will, learning processes over the past several hundred years have closed us off.”\n– Dr. John E. Mack, a Harvard University psychologist and Pulitzer prize winner (source)","The Credibility of These Sources","The sources are the most credible in the world, the only issue is, the topic. No matter how much evidence for a given phenomenon, and no matter how obvious its reality, if it goes against the human mind and what we are willing to accept, it is usually ignored or greeted with ridicule. We see the same thing with science, which has largely become dogma, the downright denial of parapsychology (telepathy, healing at a distance, etc) when it has more statistically significant results than the science used to approve most of our drugs (source). It’s called cognitive dissonance… We believe what we choose to believe, and humanity is currently in the process of shedding some belief systems in order to accept new realities that once did not fit the frame, and thus were ignored and ridiculed.","One of the latest ‘whistle-blowers’ to speak openly about their knowledge about extraterrestrial visitation is Robert Bigelow, founder of the Bigelow Aerospace Corporation. Bigelow has done work for multiple international space agencies and is currently in agreements with multiple nations to build space habitats and space stations.","Before we get to his comments, it’s important to let the reader know what type of circles Bigelow is currently ‘in’ with regards to space and the extraterrestrial/UFO question in general. Bigelow’s comments were made approximately a year ago now, but not a lot of information was given as to the type of connections this person has, if it isn’t already obvious as being one of the leading aerospace contractors in the world…","Towards the end of last year, an article titled “Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious U.F.O Program” put to rest the question of whether or not UFOs are real. CEO Tom Delonge, along with several other people, including a recently retired director of Lockheed Aerospace, Steve Justice, a Department of Defense Scientist, Hal Puthoff, a senior intelligence officer from the CIA, Jim Semivan, a Director of National Intelligence, Louis Elizondo, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and Bush Administrations, Christopher Mellon, and many more are all releasing official video footage and electro-optical data (radar trackings, returns) and letting the world know that these things (UFOs) are real.","I go into more detail regarding the latest updates in an article I published previously:","Multiple people from within this new initiative have expressed that they believe there is an extraterrestrial intelligence behind the operation of some of this craft.","This movement brought to light the Pentagon’s UFO program (AATIP) for aerial threats, one program out of what could be many, according to Hal Puthoff. You can view the entire team and their credentials here.","The main hub for all of this recent and future ‘official mainstream’ UFO disclosure is the To The Stars Academy, it’s the organization that’s releasing all of this information.","Where does Bigelow come in? Well, as the New York Times article points out:","The shadowy program – parts of it remain classified – began in 2007, and initially it was largely funded at the request of Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was the Senate majority leader at the time and who has long had an interest in space phenomena. Most of the money went to an aerospace research company run by a billionaire entrepreneur and longtime friend of Mr. Reid’s, Robert Bigelow, who is currently working with NASA to produce expandable craft for humans to use in space.","Bigelow is part of the team at To The Stars Academy, and here’s what he had to say about extraterrestrials,","“I am absolutely convinced, that’s all there is to it. There has been and is an existing presence, an ET presence.”","He also stated that we “don’t have to go anywhere” to find extraterrestrial life, that we can find it here on Earth, implying that they’re already here, walking among us, and based on my research, are already working with multiple governments.","How many races are we talking about? Perhaps hundreds, maybe even thousands of races have been catalogued by our governments worldwide.","For decades, as General Carlos Cavero told the world in 1979, “everythinghas been in a process of investigation both in the United States and in Spain, as well as the rest of the world.”On a global scale, “the nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon”and there is “an international exchange of data.”(Via Richard Donal’s UFOs for the 21st Century Mind)","A couple of years ago, longtime Bigelow Aerospace executive Mike Gold, who’s now director of Washington operations for Space Systems Loral, was asked about how Bigelow Aerospace’s’ involvement with UFOs.","He gave an intriguing answer, with some interesting expressions on his face. He mentions how he finds the subjects matter “very interesting,” and also mentions a congressional hearing where scientists emphasized that the universe is teeming with life. He goes on to state that he “cannot comment” on what Bigelow Aerospace does with UFO reports, but glad that “somebody is taking the reports because these are important issues that deserves serious attention.” (source)","Clearly, we now know that this is the case!","“An extraterrestrial influence is investigating our planet. Something is monitoring the planet and they are monitoring it very cautiously.” — 2008 Presidential Candidate, Mike Gravel (source)(source)","People Are Taking Placebo Pills To Deal With Health Problems & It’s Working","In Brief","The Facts:","People are now involved in studies where they are told they are taking a placebo medication, and it in fact is one, and they are being healed. The mainstream is finally picking up on mind-body connection.","Reflect On:","Is this the true power of our mind? Our consciousness? When we want to get better deep down, do we not make that decision in our mind and thus heal? What does this say about harmful and side effect-ridden medications?","An article published in Scientific American is a clear marker for showing just how much the mainstream has caught on to the fact that the mind-body connection is much more powerful than we previously thought, and could explain why more and more people are gravitating towards alternative forms of medicine.","A growing body of scientific research suggests that our mind can play an important role in healing our body – or in staying healthy in the first place…There are now several lines of research suggesting that our mental perception of the world constantly informs and guides our immune system in a way that makes us better able to respond to future threats. – Dr. Bruce Lipton, from The Biology of Belief","Health is one area where we can clearly see how our mind is connected to physical material reality, and how non-material science is going to play an even more important role as we move through 2018 and beyond. It’s not just health though, research in the areas of neuroscience and quantum physics is also showing how vital our thoughts, perceptions, emotions and feelings (factors associated with consciousness) are with regards to understanding the true nature of our reality.","Mind influencing matter is no longer something that’s being trivialized. There are even declassified intelligence agency documents and peer-reviewed studies that have been published that clearly show an effect at both the quantum level, and the classical mechanical level as well. If you want to learn more about this, a great place to start is with the Institute of Noetic Sciences, founded by Apollo 14 Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell.","It’s really no surprise to see this topic pop up all over mainstream media outlets, it’s a common occurrence these days. When something so spectacular gains attention and becomes so obvious, it’s almost impossible to ignore, despite the fact that its discovery has been around for decades.","Open-Label Placebo Experiment","Time magazine recently published an article about a woman (now a 71-year old medical assistant) and her struggle with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). She tried everything, from drugs to changing her diet. It was a horrible way to live, she told the Times, as she was often huddled in a corner and keeled over in pain. It’s something that can really debilitate your life. Approximately ten years ago today, she decided to enroll herself into a study, a first of its kind clinical trial, one where the patient would be receiving a placebo pill. The pill had no active ingredients, and she felt “deflated,” that she got her hopes up for nothing.","Three weeks later, after taking the pill twice daily, Buonanno (the 71-year old medical assistant) was symptom free. She had never gone so long without an attack. “I didn’t have a clue what was going on,” she says. “I still don’t.”","The placebo effect is a non-therapeutic treatment (like a sham pill), and it improves a patient’s physical condition. This has been documented for centuries. The interesting thing about the study the woman decided to participate in, is the fact that patients taking the placebo pill were well aware that they were taking a placebo. With traditional placebo studies, patients are made to believe that they are taking something that will benefit them and improve their condition. In 2009, Harvard Medical School launched the first open-label placebo, where patients knew what they were taking, and they started with people who had IBS, including the 71- year old woman. As Time points out,","The findings were surprising. Nearly twice as many people in the trial who knowingly received placebo pills reported experiencing adequate symptom relief, compared with the people who received no treatment. Not only that but the men and women taking the placebo also doubled their rates of improvement to a point that was about equal to the effects of two IBS medications that were commonly used at the time.","The team of researchers, alongside a team at the Program in Placebo Studies and Therapeutic Encounter at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, have secured a $2.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to replicate the study mentioned above. So far, researchers have treated 270 patients and intend to treat approximately 100 more with IBV via their ongoing clinical trial.","How Is This Working?","Despite the fact that the Placebo effect has been documented for well over one-hundred years, experts still can’t pinpoint what underlies this mechanism. It seems quite simple to me: it’s consciousness and the basic biology of belief. Some people argue that that the human body does not respond to treatment, but instead, the ritual of treatment. The actual pill has no effect, so what else could it be? What’s interesting is that the effect is now demonstrated even when the person knows it’s just a placebo!","There is no money in the placebo, which is why we probably haven’t heard about it much, or not enough attention is paid to it. Today, it’s well recognized in modern medicine, doctors at the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, for example, have shown that fake surgeries – slicing people’s knees open and sewing them back together without any treatment at all – provide the same improvements for people with osteoarthritis of the knee as real knee surgery.","Isn’t that remarkable?","Other Examples Of The Placebo Effect","Another example comes from a study published in 2002 by the New England Journal of Medicine which looked at surgery for patients with severe debilitating knee pain. It’s long been thought that there is no placebo effect observed in surgery, but this just isn’t true. This study divided people into three groups, for one group the surgeons saved the damaged cartilage in the knee. For another, they flushed out the knee joint by removing all of the material believed to be causing inflammation. The third group received a fake surgery, the patients were simply sedated and tricked into thinking that they actually had the surgery. All three groups went through the same rehab process, and the results were astonishing. The placebo group improved just as much as the other two groups who had the surgery.","The placebo effect should be the subject of major, funded research efforts. If medical researchers could figure out how to leverage the placebo effect, they would hand doctors an efficient, energy-based, side effect-free tool to treat disease. Energy healers say they already have such tools, but I am a scientist, and I believe the more we know about the science of the placebo, the better we’ll be able to use it in clinical settings. – Bruce Lipton, Ph.D (Taken from his book Biology of Belief – Highly recommended to learn more about this phenomenon)","A 2002 article published in the American Psychological Association’s Prevention & Treatment, conducted by University of Connecticut Psychology Professor Irving Kirsch and titled “The Emperor’s New Drugs,” made some more shocking discoveries (source)(source). Kirsch found that 80% of the effectiveness of antidepressants, as measured in clinical trials, could be attributed to the placebo effect. Kirsch even filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to get information on the clinical trials of the top antidepressants.","“The difference between the response of the drugs and the response of the placebo was less than two points on average on this clinical scale that goes from fifty to sixty points. That’s a very small difference, that difference is clinically meaningless,” Professor Kirsch explains. (source)","Studies examining non-physical healing go beyond the placebo. There are hundreds of studies examining the effect of human intention (the human mind) and how it can also alter physical material reality as well as our health. I go into more detail on these topics in the article linked below, so please feel free to check it out if interested!"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.","Wednesday's announcement follows revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for \"some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\"","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page.","Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding \"clearer explanations\" about how its privacy controls work.","Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, called the new settings \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns.","Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.","To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called \"access your information,\" a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That's where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.","Cox said that while the changes are \"in line with the principle of GDPR,\" there's also a \"bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\"","Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy, but gave no further details."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

But is it ok for a few firms to possess so much data and thereby wield so much power? In the U.S., at least, antitrust officials so far seem ambivalent about these data-opolies. They’re free, the thinking goes, so what’s the harm? But that reasoning is misguided. Upon closer examination, data-opolies can actually be more dangerous than traditional monopolies. They can affect not only our wallets but our privacy, autonomy, democracy, and well-being.","James Graham/Getty Images","“It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts,” Cambridge Analytica’s managing director told an undercover reporter, “because actually it’s all about emotion.” To target U.S. voters and appeal to their hopes, neuroses, and fears, the political consulting firm needed to train its algorithm to predict and map personality traits. That required lots of personal data. So, to build these psychographic profiles, Cambridge Analytica enlisted a Cambridge University professor, whose app collected data on about 50 million Facebook users and their friends. Facebook, at that time, allowed app developers to collect this personal data. Facebook argued that Cambridge Analytica and the professor violated its data polices. But this was not the first time its policies were violated. Nor is it likely to be the last.","This scandal came on the heels of Russia’s using Facebook, Google, and Twitter “to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election.” It heightened concerns over today’s tech giants and the influence they have.","That influence comes in part from data. Facebook, Google, Amazon, and similar companies are “data-opolies.” By that I mean companies that control a key platform which, like a coral reef, attracts to its ecosystem users, sellers, advertisers, software developers, apps, and accessory makers. Apple and Google, for example, each control a popular mobile phone operating system platform (and key apps on that platform), Amazon controls the largest online merchant platform, and Facebook controls the largest social network platform. Through their leading platforms, a significant volume and variety of personal data flows. The velocity in acquiring and exploiting this personal data can help these companies obtain significant market power.","Is it OK for a few firms to possess so much data and thereby wield so much power? In the U.S., at least, antitrust officials so far seem ambivalent about these data-opolies. They’re free, the thinking goes, so what’s the harm? But that reasoning is misguided. Data-opolies pose tremendous risks, for consumers, workers, competition, and the overall health of our democracy. Here’s why.","Why U.S. Antitrust Isn’t Worried About Data-opolies","The European competition authorities have recently brought actions against four data-opolies: Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (or GAFA for short). The European Commission, for example, fined Google a record €2.42 billion for leveraging its monopoly in search to advance its comparative shopping service. The Commission also preliminarily found Google to have abused its dominant position with both its Android mobile operating system and with AdSense. Facebook, Germany’s competition agency preliminarily found, abused its dominant position “by making the use of its social network conditional on its being allowed to limitlessly amass every kind of data generated by using third-party websites and merge it with the user’s Facebook account.”","We will likely see more fines and other remedies in the next few years from the Europeans. But in the U.S., the data-opolies have largely escaped antitrust scrutiny, under both the Obama and Bush administrations. Notably, while the European Commission found Google’s search bias to be anticompetitive, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission did not. From 2000 onward, the Department of Justice brought only one monopolization case in total, against anyone. (In contrast, the DOJ, between 1970 and 1972, brought 39 civil and 3 criminal cases against monopolies and oligopolies.)","The current head of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division recognized the enforcement gap between the U.S. and Europe. He noted his agency’s “particular concerns in digital markets.” But absent “demonstrable harm to competition and consumers,” the DOJ is “reluctant to impose special duties on digital platforms, out of [its] concern that special duties might stifle the very innovation that has created dynamic competition for the benefit of consumers.”","So, the divergence in antitrust enforcement may reflect differences over these data-opolies’ perceived harms. Ordinarily the harm from monopolies are higher prices, less output, or reduced quality. It superficially appears that data-opolies pose little, if any risk, of these harms. Unlike some pharmaceuticals, data-opolies do not charge consumers exorbitant prices. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s consumer products are ostensibly “free.” The data-opolies’ scale can also mean higher quality products. The more people use a particular search engine, the more the search engine’s algorithm can learn users’ preferences, the more relevant the search results will likely be, which in turn will likely attract others to the search engine, and the positive feedback continues.","As Robert Bork argued, there “is no coherent case for monopolization because a search engine, like Google, is free to consumers and they can switch to an alternative search engine with a click.”","How Data-opolies Harm","But higher prices are not the only way for powerful companies to harm their consumers or the rest of society. Upon closer examination, data-opolies can pose at least eight potential harms.","Lower-quality products with less privacy. Companies, antitrust authorities increasingly recognize, can compete on privacy and protecting data. But without competition, data-opolies face less pressure. They can depress privacy protection belowcompetitive levels and collect personal data above competitive levels. The collection of too much personal data can be the equivalent of charging an excessive price.","Data-opolies can also fail to disclose what data they collect and how they will use the data. They face little competitive pressure to change their opaque privacy policies. Even if a data-opoly improves its privacy statement, so what? The current notice-and-consent regime is meaningless when there are no viable competitive alternatives and the bargaining power is so unequal.","Surveillance and security risks. In a monopolized market, personal data is concentrated in a few firms. Consumers have limited outside options that offer better privacy protection. This raises additional risks, including:","Government capture. The fewer the number of firms controlling the personal data, the greater the potential risk that a government will “capture” the firm. Companies need things from government; governments often want access to data. When there are only a few firms, this can increase the likelihood of companies secretly cooperating with the government to provide access to data. China, for example, relies on its data-opolies to better monitor its population.","Covert surveillance. Even if the government cannot capture a data-opoly, its rich data-trove increases a government’s incentive to circumvent the data-opoly’s privacy protections to tap into the personal data. Even if the government can’t strike a deal to access the data directly, it may be able to do so covertly.","Implications of a data policy violation/security breach. Data-opolies have greater incentives to prevent a breach than do typical firms. But with more personal data concentrated in fewer companies, hackers, marketers, political consultants, among others, have even greater incentives to find ways to circumvent or breach the dominant firm’s security measures. The concentration of data means that if one of them is breached, the harm done could be orders of magnitude greater than with a normal company. While consumers may be outraged, a dominant firm has less reason to worry of consumers’ switching to rivals.","Wealth transfer to data-opolies. Even when their products and services are ostensibly “free,” data-opolies can extract significant wealth in several ways that they otherwise couldn’t in a competitive market:","First, data-opolies can extract wealth by getting personal data without having to pay for the data’s fair market value. The personal data collected may be worth far more than the cost of providing the “free” service. The fact that the service is “free” does not mean we are fairly compensated for our data. Thus, data-opolies have a strong economic incentive to maintain the status quo, in which users, as the MIT Technology Review put it, “have little idea how much personal data they have provided, how it is used, and what it is worth.” If the public knew, and if they had viable alternatives, they might hold out for compensation.","Second, something similar can happen but with the content users create. Data-opolies can extract wealth by getting creative content from users for free. In a competitive market, users could conceivably demand compensation not only for their data but also their contributions to YouTube and Facebook. With no viable alternatives, they cannot.","Third, data-opolies can extract wealth from sellers upstream. One example is when data-opolies scrape valuable content from photographers, authors, musicians, and other websites and post it on their own platform. In this case, the wealth of the data-opolies comes at the expense of other businesses in their value chain.","Fourth,data-opolies can extract our wealth indirectly, when their higher advertising fees are passed along in the prices for the advertised goods and services. If the data-opolies faced more competitors for their advertising services, ads could cost even less — and therefore so might the products being advertised.","Finally, data-opolies can extract wealth from both sellers upstream and consumers downstream by facilitating or engaging in “behavioral discrimination,” a form of price discrimination based on past behavior — like, say, your internet browsing. They can use the personal data to get people to buy things they did not necessarily want at the highest price they are willing to pay.","As data-opolies expand their platforms to digital personal assistants, the Internet of Things, and smart technologies, the concern is that their data advantage will increase their competitive advantage and market power. As a result, the data-opolies’ monopoly profits will likely increase, at our expense.","Loss of trust. Market economies rely on trust. For online markets to deliver their benefits, people must trust firms and their use of the personal data. But as technology evolves and more personal data is collected, we are increasingly aware that a few powerful firms are using our personal information for their own benefit, not ours. When data-opolies degrade privacy protections below competitive levels, some consumers will choose not “to share their data, to limit their data sharing with companies, or even to lie when providing information,” as the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority put it. Consumers may forgo the data-opolies’ services, which they otherwise would have used if privacy competition were robust. This loss would represent what economists call a deadweight welfare loss. In other words, as distrust increases, society overall becomes worse off.","Significant costs on third parties. Additionally, data-opolies that control a key platform, like a mobile phone operating system, can cheaply exclude rivals by:","steering users and advertisers to their own products and services to the detriment of rival sellers on the platform (and contrary to consumers’ wishes)","degrading an independent app’s functionality","reducing traffic to an independent app by making it harder to find on its search engine or app store","Data-opolies can also impose costs on companies seeking to protect our privacy interests. My book with Ariel Ezrachi, Virtual Competition, discusses, for example, Google’s kicking the privacy app Disconnect out of its Android app store.","Less innovation in markets dominated by data-opolies. Data-opolies can chill innovation with a weapon that earlier monopolies lacked. Allen Grunes and I call it the “now-casting radar.” Our book Big Data and Competition Policyexplores how some platforms have a relative advantage in accessing and analyzing data to discern consumer trends well before others. Data-opolies can use their relative advantage to see what products or services are becoming more popular. With their now-casting radar, data-opolies can acquire or squelch these nascent competitive threats.","Social and moral concerns. Historically, antitrust has also been concerned with how monopolies can hinder individual autonomy. Data-opolies can also hurt individual autonomy. To start with, they can direct (and limit) opportunities for startups that subsist on their super-platform. This includes third-party sellers that rely on Amazon’s platform to reach consumers, newspapers and journalists that depend on Facebook and Google to reach younger readers, and, as the European Commission’s Google Shopping Case explores, companies that depend on traffic from Google’s search engine.","But the autonomy concerns go beyond the constellation of app developers, sellers, journalists, musicians, writers, photographers, and artists dependent on the data-opoly to reach users. Every individual’s autonomy is at stake. In January, the hedge fund Jana Partners joined the California State Teachers’ Retirement pension fund to demand that Apple do more to address the effects of its devices on children. As The Economistnoted, “You know you are in trouble if a Wall Street firm is lecturing you about morality.” The concern is that the data-opolies’ products are purposefully addictive, and thereby eroding individuals’ ability to make free choices.","There is an interesting counterargument that’s worth noting, based on the interplay between monopoly power and competition. On the one hand, in monopolized markets, consumers have fewer competitive options. So, arguably, there is less need to addict them. On the other hand, data-opolies, like Facebook and Google, even without significant rivals, can increase profits by increasing our engagement with their products. So, data-opolies can have an incentive to exploit behavioral biases and imperfect willpower to addict users — whether watching YouTube videos or posting on Instagram.","Political concerns. Economic power often translates into political power. Unlike earlier monopolies, data-opolies, given how they interact with individuals, possess a more powerful tool: namely, the ability to affect the public debate and our perception of right and wrong.","Many people now receive their news from social media platforms. But the news isn’t just passively transmitted. Data-opolies can affect how we feel and think. Facebook, for example, in an “emotional contagion” study, manipulated 689,003 users’ emotions by altering their news feed. Other risks of this sort include:","Bias. In filtering the information we receive based on our preferences, data-opolies can reduce the viewpoints we receive, thereby leading to “echo chambers” and “filter bubbles.”","Censorship. Data-opolies, through their platform, can control or block content that users receive, and enforce governmental censorship of political or religious information.","Manipulation. Data-opolies can promote stories that further their particular business or political interests, instead of their relevance or quality.","Limiting the Power of Data-opolies","Upon closer examination, data-opolies can actually be moredangerous than traditional monopolies. They can affect not only our wallets but our privacy, autonomy, democracy, and well-being.","Markets dominated by these data-opolies will not necessarily self-correct. Network effects, high switching costs for consumers (given the lack of data portability and user rights over their data), and weak privacy protection help data-opolies maintain their dominance.","Luckily, global antitrust enforcement can help. The Reagan administration, in espousing the then-popular Chicago School of economics beliefs, discounted concerns over monopolies. The Supreme Court, relying on faulty economic reasoning, surmised that charging monopoly prices was “an important element of the free market system.” With the rise of a progressive, anti-monopoly New Brandeis School, the pendulum is swinging the other way. Given the emergence of data-opolies, this is a welcomed change.","Nonetheless, global antitrust enforcement, while a necessary tool to deter these harms, is not sufficient. Antitrust enforcers must coordinate with privacy and consumer protection officials to ensure that the conditions for effective privacy competition and an inclusive economy are in place.","Maurice E. Stucke is a co-founder of The Konkurrenz Group and a law professor at the University of Tennessee."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Adam Schiff is calling for the social media company to appear before Congress again.","\"I think Facebook should come back and testify,\" Schiff said in an interview with KQED.","The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee also said he thinks Christopher Wylie -- the former Cambridge Analytica employee who went public with the allegations against the firm linked to President Trump's campaign -- should testify.","\"We need to bring in the whistleblower,\" Schiff told KQED. \"And I'll be inviting him to come testify before our committee, whether the Republicans show up or not.\"","Sponsored By","According to The New York Times, Cambridge Analytica used the Facebook data to develop techniques that formed the basis of its work on the Trump campaign.","In a blog post on Friday, Facebook announced that it had suspended the firm over allegations that it kept the improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had been deleted.","Facebook explained in the post that Cambridge Analytica had years ago received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm was not authorized to have the information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","The social media company has also suspended Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower and former Cambridge Analytica employee.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan's data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\"","According to one tech law expert, it's no surprise that the data firm was able to harvest the Facebook profile data.","\"This was not a security protocol breach,\" said Eric Goldman, a Santa Clara University law professor and director of the law school's High Tech Law Institute. \"When Facebook gave permission to the app to collect the data from consumers, there were not technical barriers that restricted how the app might be able to use or transfer that data.\"","Goldman says the only thing protecting the data was a contract, and it's not surprising that some app developers would disregard their promises and transfer the data to third parties.","\"It's entirely foreseeable that some of the app developers would ignore the contract restrictions that Facebook thought were protecting the consumer data,\" Goldman said.","And Goldman says this free movement of consumer data is fairly unique to Facebook.","\"They are so open with so much consumer data to app developers,\" he said. \"Many other sites have the richness of data that Facebook has and do a tighter control of their app developers than Facebook has historically done.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

According to the Financial Times, reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly filmed a series of meetings, including one with the chief executive. The report is due to air this week.","Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be recalling Nix to give further testimony to explain why he had told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook.","“We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments,” he said.","Collins will also call on Zuckerberg to testify. He said the company appeared to have previously sent executives who were able to avoid difficult questions and who “claimed not to know the answers”.","The two men may also face a summons from US lawmakers. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia.","The Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian.","“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records. It denies using any Facebook data in the campaign.","Shortly before the story broke, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer that it was making “false and defamatory” allegations and reserved Facebook’s legal position. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach.","It also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan.","The public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate. He described it as a chilling attack on someone acting in the public interest.","“They acknowledged my offer but then turned around and shot the messenger. I’m trying to make amends for my mistakes and so should Facebook,” he told the Guardian. “Facebook has known about this for at least two years and did almost nothing to fix it. This is not new. And it’s only by coming forward that Facebook is now taking action. People need to know this kind of profiling is happening.”","Collins said his committee wanted more information from Facebook about the circumstances around the breach. “Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","Last month, both Facebook representatives and Nix told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from GSR.","Play Video","0:25","Cambridge Analytica chief denies working with Facebook data - video","But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ‘platform policies’ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” the statement said.","Collins attacked Facebook for appearing to have been “deliberately avoiding answering straight questions” in testimony to the committee.","“It is now clear that data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,” Collins said. “Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","Cambridge Analytica responded to the Observer story on Twitter before Collins had said Nix would be recalled. “We refute(s) these mischaracterizations and false allegations,” it said.","“Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data,” the company said. “When we learned GSR sold us Facebook data that it shouldn’t have done, we deleted it all – system wide audit to verify.”","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

He has encouraged developers to connect apps and programs to Facebook’s platform.CreditCreditJeff Roberson/Associated Press","In 2007, a young Mark Zuckerberg stood on a stage in San Francisco and announced that Facebook was throwing open its doors.","No longer, he said, would Facebook be a closed-off software product like every other social network. Instead, it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it.","“We want to make Facebook into something of an operating system,” Mr. Zuckerberg told a reporter.","At the time, the announcement drew little notice outside the programming world. Developers quickly went to work making fun and quirky apps that plugged into Facebook — early hits included “Rendezbook,” a kind of proto-Tinder that allowed users to match with each other for “random flings,” and CampusRank, which allowed college students to nominate their peers for yearbook-type awards.","Later, popular games like FarmVille arrived, and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials. In some ways, it was a fair trade. Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users’ internet habits, and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users. In all, millions of apps have been created with Facebook’s open platform tools.","Through it all, Facebook’s users were mostly unfazed. Sure, these apps collected data about their lives. But they seemed convenient and harmless, and, really, what could go wrong?","Today, more than a decade later, the consequences of Facebook’s laissez-faire approach are becoming clear. Over the weekend, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm, improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users, and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.","What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn’t technically a data breach, since this trove of personal information wasn’t stolen from Facebook’s servers. Rather, it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called “thisisyourdigitallife.”","That app, which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor, collected data about the 270,000 people who installed it, along with data about their Facebook friends, totaling 50 million people in all. The professor, Aleksandr Kogan, then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica.","Technically, only this last step violated Facebook’s rules, which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third-party app. The rest was business as usual. Third-party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day, including their ages, location, pages they’ve liked and groups they belong to. Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information, but it’s unclear how many do.","This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook, which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform. Permissiveness is a feature, as they say, not a bug.","But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica, some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2.2 billion registered users.","“It seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people’s data,” said Can Duruk, a technology consultant and software engineer. Facebook, he said, was “extremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get.”","In a Facebook post on Monday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake.","“We thought that every app could be social,” Mr. Bosworth wrote. “Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures. It was a reasonable vision but it didn’t materialize the way we had hoped.”","An early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook’s third-party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel, then at The Wall Street Journal, reported that an online tracking company, RapLeaf, was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third-party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants. In response, Facebook cut off RapLeaf’s data access and said it would “dramatically limit” the misuse of its users’ personal information by outside parties.","But preventing data-hungry developers from exploiting Facebook’s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging. In 2015, Facebook removed the ability of third-party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app, citing privacy concerns. (Cambridge Analytica’s data trove, which included this type of information, was gathered in 2014, before the change.) Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications.","But the core functions of Facebook’s open platform tool are still intact. There are still many third-party apps like “thisisyourdigitallife” out there, vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users. That data doesn’t disappear, and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.","Not all open data access is used irresponsibly. Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook’s third-party development tools to respond to natural disasters. And many of the functions that internet users depend on — for example, the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app — are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third-party development known as application programming interfaces, or A.P.I.s.","“Everything we depend on uses A.P.I.s,” said Kin Lane, a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist. “They’re in your home, in your business, in your car. It’s how these platforms innovate and do cool, interesting things.”","In Facebook’s case, permissive data policies were also good for business. Third-party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook’s platform, giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company. Restricting access to data would limit Facebook’s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead, making those products better.","In this context, it’s even less surprising that Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans. After all, why else would the quiz be there?","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: How Did Data Sharing Go From Feature to Bug On Facebook?.

At this point, there is no real alternative to the site in every respect; no greener pastures to speak of.","Many community organisers, minority groups and isolated individuals use the platform as a lifeline. Its thousands of groups and 2.2bn users allow for a sense of community in an increasingly individualised and frenetic world.","For many, Facebook is the only way to run their business, organise protests and training events, or keep in touch with far-flung friends and family. Many online activists have noted the privilege inherent in being able to completely delete your Facebook accounts with no repercussions on your offline life.","The tale of the Graph API","Prof Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University explained in a Medium post that much of Facebook’s problems (particularly around Cambridge Analytica) involve the company’s Graph API which was launched in 2010 and was the primary way for apps to read and write to the Facebook Social Graph.","The Graph API, which was deprecated in 2014 and completely shuttered in April 2015, was designed in such a way that unusually rich seams of data about users’ friends were easily obtained from quizzes such as the one Cambridge Analytica allegedly used to harvest information. Facebook hailed this as “building a web where the default is social”. Albright said the “extended permissions” of the firm’s Graph API were the main issue and added that the company’s existing privacy settings are a “grand illusion”.","Albright explained: “In reality, Facebook users have the exact opposite ability to control what is passively shared about them – meaning the information and metadata others can extract.”","Rather than overstating elements around the issue or simply telling people to delete their accounts, a thorough rethink of data privacy as a concept as well as an overhaul of the business models that built these tech giants is what is sorely needed. The social network’s power for organisation and role as a lifeline for many is not to be underestimated.","I still want to delete my account. What do I do?","Facebook offers you two different options; the first is deactivating your account. This means you can reactivate whenever you want and you can continue to use Messenger if you so wish. If you want to completely delete your account, you need to send a request to Facebook.","If you log back in following a request to deactivate, it is cancelled automatically, so be wary. At this stage, make sure sites that you use Facebook to authenticate yourself on allow you to change your verification method before the request is processed – for example, Instagram (which is owned by Facebook).","Accessing your Facebook archive before you decide to deactivate is also recommended. If you go to your general account settings, you will see an option to download a copy of your Facebook data. Clicking ‘Start my Archive’ begins this process.","What are the alternatives?","If you use Facebook Messenger to interact with and chat to family members, there are a whole host of frankly superior apps and services you can use. WhatsApp, while owned by Facebook, still has end-to-end encryption and is better than nothing. Signal is the standard for secure messaging – its encryption is used in WhatsApp and Acton recently funnelled millions of dollars into improving it.","For organising events, tools such as Doodle, Paperless Post and Eventbrite are very useful. Although migrating phone numbers and email addresses will seem like a pain at first, the knowledge that your interactions are more secure should be a positive catalyst to take the plunge.","Photo-sharing is a primary use of Facebook for many, and Instagram is also property of the company. While Google Photos, iCloud Photo Storage and others work well, social networks such as Tumblr are a good alternative if photos for public consumption are important to you.","Securing your internet experience","If you cannot delete Facebook at this point (and many can’t), there are ways you can secure it as best you can. Take a look around your app settings page on Facebook and see which apps and plugins have access to your information. Choose which details you want to keep private, such as religion or family– think of it as a spring clean.","Go directly to sites rather than taking quizzes through your Facebook login – this stops app developers from accessing the information on your profile.","Installing an extension such as Ghostery, Privacy Badger or Disconnect allows you to browse the internet while blocking company tracking requests such as the Facebook tracking pixel, which is embedded in numerous websites and lets advertisers monitor your browsing habits.","Once GDPR comes into force, data subjects will be able to take back control of their own data, and the threat of large fines means companies such as Facebook will now be obliged to share the information they store about you.","For those who want to take a long hard look at their privacy online in a more general sense, the Tactical Tech Data Detox is an equally enlightening and unnerving look into how tech firms track users – it’s far from just Facebook.","Updated, 4.40pm, 22 March 2018: This article was amended to reflect that the version of Facebook’s Graph API (v1.0) has not been in use since April 2015."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

This data reportedly included information siphoned from hundreds of thousands of Amazon Mechanical Turkers who were paid to use a \"personality prediction app\" that collected data from them and also anyone they were friends with -- about 50 million accounts. That data reportedly turned into information used by the likes of Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and the Donald Trump campaign for social media messaging and \"micro-targeting\" individuals based on shared characteristics.","Now, reports by The New York Times and The Guardian reveal what was behind the timing of that Friday night news dump. According to reporters from both outlets, which were collaborating, the social network had downplayed their reporting and even threatened to sue The Guardian, over what they learned from documents and a whistleblower (who Facebook included in its ban list): Christopher Wylie.","Wylie's account largely fills in the gaps from Facebook's statement. While Facebook didn't explain how many users had their data snagged by the \"thisisyourdigitallife\" app, the reports say it pulled private info from more than 50 million people even though they didn't know about it or consent -- an act that at the time was allowed under Facebook's rules. About 30 million of those (a number previously reported by The Intercept) contained enough information for Cambridge Analytica to match profiles with other data and complete its \"psychographic\" work -- learning about individuals and trying to target them with personally tailored messages.","That's the bit that causes Wylie to describe his former employer as engaging in something more like psychological warfare than simple \"data analysis.\" Cambridge Analytica maintains that \"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR.\" It also claims none of the data was used during the 2016 campaign, however, the NYT notes that its CEO previously said the Trump efforts drew on psychographics it had created for the Ted Cruz campaign.","As for Facebook, that company is staunchly pushing the line that this does not represent a \"breach\" or a \"leak\". Deputy General Counsel tweeted that \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\" In a series of now-deleted tweets, CSO Alex Stamos said the app's creator \"lied\" to users and Facebook about what he was using the data for, but said his use was consistent with its API at the time, and the way some APIs for contact sharing works on platforms like Android and iOS. Facebook updated last night's release with a new statement:","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","That will not be enough to avoid further scrutiny however -- according to The Guardian, the British Information Commissioner's Office and the Electoral Commission are investigating. In the US, Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey announced her office is opening an investigation, and they probably won't be the only ones.","That's above and beyond the professor suing Cambridge Analytica in the UK to find out the full extent of the data it has acquired. David Carroll's lawsuit was filed yesterday, and a crowdfunding campaign to back the effort has already raised £30,000."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a Democratic member of the committee, not the ranking Democratic member. (The ranking Democrat is Senator Dianne Feinstein.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","TechCrunch has reached out to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica with additional questions about the timing of this disclosure and the data’s relationship, if any, to the Trump campaign and will update when we hear back."],"isopubdate":""}

Though it has been alleged that this information access was obtained legally and was willingly provided by users, Kogan’s company, Global Science Research, then had an agreement to disclose data to Cambridge Analytica, however, the latter in fact took a majority of the data without authorisation.","It is this London-based company, marketing itself as using ‘data to change audience behaviour’, that has been accused of using the sensitive information of over 50 million Facebook users and applying that data to build a software programme that influences voting choices. The data itself was also gathered by Cambridge Analytica at the cost of $7 million, is has been reportec by The Guardian. In another exposing report, whistleblower Christopher Wylie has further pointed out the company was ‘hijacking the profiles of millions of Facebook users’ whilst also possessing proof from ‘Facebook’s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately’.","In what appears to be a cross-intelligence investigation, involving a number of news agencies, Channel 4’s documentary even captured recordings of Cambridge Analytica boasting about former dodgy dealings relating to political campaigns in an undercover sting. Through conversations with the company’s executives, it was suggested they could ‘speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true and make sure that it’s video recorded’ and also ‘send some girls around to a candidates house’, all whilst working ‘in the shadows’. The corruption surrounding this company amplifies global concerns about their access to personal information and how this was used in campaigns.","Both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have denied any wrongdoing however it was late on Friday night that Facebook announced it was suspending the data company Cambridge Analytica from accessing it’s platform, shortly before news of the breach broke.","This isn’t a spy movie. We’re a data analytics company doing research & analysis on commercial, public and data sets for clients 7/8","Although Facebook have said they have launched an investigation into the issue, Cambridge Analytica’s links to Donald Trump’s campaign as well as ties to Brexit and a variety of other worldwide political movements brings into question Facebook’s pivotal relationship with political decisions. A key Trump supporter, Robert Mercer, has been ousted for donating $15 million funding to the data analytics company and as well as receiving support from Steve Bannon, Cambridge Analytica claim to have polled votes in seventeen American states and used online advertising to sway the political decisions. On top of this Downing Street have voiced new concerns about the handling of personal data and look to review legislation surrounding online information in the wake of fears that technology companies are growing quicker than anticipated and thus not providing sufficient focus upon meeting regulations.","The weekend has unravelled in a bout of increasingly bad news for Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. At the time of writing, Facebook stocks had plummeted by 5% (a loss of $27 billion) as the data revelations bring into question the bigger picture of data safety on the internet platform.","Mark Zuckerberg may not have to answer to anyone, but if the calls from politicians, customers and shareholders intensify, he may come to realize that it's in his best interests to do so. $FB down 8% today. My story. https://t.co/6DqZtp2nVm","It is yet to be understood exactly how much personal data Cambridge Analytica have gained access to, however in order to understand quite how much data Facebook stores on each user it requires a simple download from the site’s security page to be provided with pages upon pages of personal data, likes, photographs and statuses. It’s a somewhat terrifying revelation.","Noted as one of the biggest data breaches Facebook has faced so far, this story is far from over as the question of security delves ever deeper amidst the intricacies of technology and personal security. Though it has been claimed that Zuckerberg doesn’t have to answer to anyone, if his platform is further proven to have had such a politically fuelled, and potentially illegal contribution, then it might be time for the CEO to emerge from the cyber sidelines and defend his company.","Hi I am so thrilled I found your web site, I really found you by\nerror, while I was searching on Digg for something else, Nonetheless I am here now\nand would just like to say many thanks for\na tremendous post and a all round thrilling blog (I also love the\ntheme/design), I don?t have time to look over it all at the moment but I have bookmarked it and\nalso added your RSS feeds, so when I have time I will be back to read more, Please do\nkeep up the awesome jo. https://top200ragnarok.com/index.php?a=stats&u=leslieborowski5"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

In this we have the potential not just to affect Facebook but also other corporations and services that make a profitable business out of personal data.","Updated May 2018","Concerns over personal data collection and its use for profit and political control are not new. Iconic German band Kraftwerk sang about it back in early 80s with their song Computer World (\"Interpol and Deutsche Bank. FBI and Scotland Yard. Business, numbers. Money, people\"). Though the current scandal is focused on elections, the collection and use of personal data goes much further than that.","To leave or not to leave","Leaving Facebook is a personal choice. Knowing that Facebook, by default, is not a privacy oriented platform; if your privacy is top priority for you, the answer is clear.","But there are various options that can adapt to your needs and what you want to make of its use. In this article we present you with information that we hope helps you make an informed decision, as well as the options at hand with practical step-by-step on how to carry out whatever decision you choose. But in case you choose to stay on Facebook, we have a set of recommendations for you here: I Just Can't Quit You! Your Privacy Guide to Facebook.","Leaving can mean different things, depending on how far you want to take it. Click on each section to jump to it directly","In the current context, leaving Facebook can have a broader effect than just lessening the flow of data the company is able to collect about you: en masse, it’s also an important act of consumer feedback or protest. Like boycotting other products, leaving the platform tells the company not just that we care about their practices and what they do with the personal information they have access to, but also that we are willing to take action. Ultimately that sends a clear message to shareholders, investors and to the companies themselves: that compromising our privacy for political and financial gain is not ok.","What does Facebook know about you?","If you are logged in to Facebook, visiting the ad preferences pageoffers you a first glimpse into some of the basic things the company knows about you. From here you can exercise a small amount of control over what kinds of ads you want to see, and what information you allow Facebook to use for marketing purposes.","In Facebook’s Settings, you can also see which apps are collecting data through Facebook, and then take steps to gain more control over these. Go to the ‘settings’ section and then on the left hand side of the screen you will see different choices, including ‘apps’.","Seems simple? Unfortunately, that is not all. Data collected about you can be collected by others and then may show up anyway. There have been several reports of Facebook having ‘shadow profiles’ of people. That is people who don’t have Facebook accounts but that they have information on anyway because of their friends activities or the data collected from them of other services. It should be as simple as a few checkboxes to control your personal data collection and use, but unfortunately it is not right now. This may change with the implementation required by General Data Protection Regulation in Europe.","What data does Facebook collect?","The list of data that Facebook collect is probably longer than you may think. From what they state in their privacy policy , the following comes up:","info you provide when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others","location of a photo","date a file was created","types of content you view or engage with","frequency & duration of your activities","when others share a photo of you","when others send a message to you","when others upload, sync or import your contact information","people and groups you are connected to & how you interact with them","who you communicate with the most","groups you share with","contact information when you upload, sync or import e.g. an address book","credit/debit card if you use facebook's services for purchases or financial transactions","billing, shipping and contact information","operating system","hardware version","device settings","file and software names and types","battery and signal strength","device identifiers","device locations (through GPS, bluetooth and wifi signals)","name of mobile operator or ISP","browser type","language and time zone","mobile phone number","IP address","information when you visit or use third-party websites and apps that use our Services (like button, log in, measurement/ad services)","information about you and your activities on and off facebook from third-party partners","information about you from companies that are owned or operated by facebook","And if you log in to an app with Facebook login, or visit a website that shows the “Like” button or one that uses its advertising services, Facebook can collect data about how you are using those websites and apps.","Facebook also receives information about your activities from third-party partners: Companies that are owned or operated by Facebook (for example WhatsApp and Instagram) may share information about you to Facebook, depending on their individual privacy policy.","You can choose to share some of the data you create on Facebook with particular audiences.","Software developer Dylan McKay downloaded his Facebook data and he found his entire call history with his partner's mum. A historical record of every single contact on his phone, including ones he no longer has, and metadata about every text message he has received or sent since getting on Facebook. He also found the metadata of every phone call he made including time and duration. You can read McKay's documentation on Twitter","Who does Facebook share our information with?","Facebook shares the information they have collected about you with their family of companies that are part of Facebook, as well as with vendors, service providers and other partners who globally support their business.","If ownership of Facebook changes, your information may be transferred to the new owner. Facebook also shares “non-personally identifiable demographic information” (like age, location, interest) with advertising, measurement and analytics services.","Facebook is not really “just Facebook”","Before you follow the steps to leave Facebook, it is important to remember that Facebook is not “only Facebook”. The company operates, and harvests personal data from their other products like WhatsApp, Instagram, and others. Taking steps towards our privacy on Facebook is a good first step, but our data is being harvested far beyond Facebook. When we review our use of these platforms, it is a good time to reassess our behavior in general across digital platforms, laptops, tablets and phones.","It is more likely than not that if an online service or an app is free, that we are paying with our personal data, and at times, with the personal data of those we are in contact with. Be it a game on our mobile phone, a dating app, a shopping website, an activity tracker like Fitbit, or a restaurant rating app.","Detach: Keep your Facebook account active, but stay well away from it","Probably the hardest of the three to maintain!","Some people advise this as a first step to deleting Facebook as opposed to going cold turkey, especially for regular users. And as a first step, it does have some value – you won’t be feeding new personal data into the platform, and the data Facebook already has will become less valuable the older it becomes.","But if you do take this route, try and set an end date for the “transition”. If your Facebook account is just a login away, it’s too easy and tempting to go back.","While you’re thinking about how to disengage, also think about what other services you use that involve Facebook. How many services do you log into using your Facebook login? To see a list of apps and websites where you have used your Facebook account to subscribe and log in follow those steps:","You will be asked for your password. (if you forgot your password there is a link on the same window to help you regain it)","Facebook will then inform you that a selection of five friends will miss you and that your contacts in exact number “will no longer be able to keep in touch with you”.","On the same page Facebook will ask you for the reason and you can choose to give one or choose “other” and refrain from explaining further.","Click deactivate","Facebook lets you know that if you deactivate your account “it will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things you've shared on Facebook. Some information may still be visible to others, such as your name in their friends list and messages you sent”.","Note that all of this just puts your profile on ice temporarily – it can be revived in a number of ways:","\"whenever you want by logging back into Facebook\" \"when you use your Facebook account to log in somewhere else\"","This means your Facebook profile will be completely restored.","Permanently deleting your account","Before you permanently delete your account, you might want to consider downloading your data from Facebook.","You can download your information from your settings. To download your information:","Click on the arrow at the top right of any Facebook page and select Settings","Click Download a Copy of Your Facebook Data at the bottom of General Account Settings","You can choose the date range, format and which data to download. Click Create File","Because this download contains your profile information, you should keep it secure and be careful when storing, sending or uploading it to any other services.","To permanently delete your account on Facebook, you have to use their ‘help’ section. But it’s simple to do: just click on the following link:","When you delete your account, your Facebook contacts won't be notified. According to Facebook “It may take up to 90 days from the beginning of the deletion process to delete all of the things you've posted, like your photos, status updates or other data stored in backup systems.” Some sources also talk of a 14-20 day waiting period before the deletion process starts. This would add to the 90 days, and if in this period you access your account for any reason, you would need to start the deletion process from start.","Important disclaimer from Facebook","“While we are deleting this information, it is inaccessible to other people using Facebook. Some of the things you do on Facebook aren’t stored in your account. For example, a friend may still have messages from you even after you delete your account. That information remains after you delete your account.”`","What all this means is that if you delete your account at the beginning of April, you will be fully Facebook-free some time in July.","There will still be some data accessible by Facebook after your account is permanently deleted, but according to Facebook it will be dissociated from personal identifiers. Something that still needs to be corroborated through independent or governmental reviewers like data protection commissioners and agencies to make sure Facebook meets its promises especially with the justified broken trust.","One more step – to keep this divorce neat!","You might have subscribed to other services using your Facebook account, and why not? It’s an easy and quick sign-up option that allows you to avoid email confirmation, entering data..etc.","But now that you have decided to delete your account, it is also time to dissociate your other accounts from Facebook. De-link those newspaper subscriptions, change the account info on your shopping websites, start getting used to subscribing to services in other ways.. and enjoy your new independence!","You can see the apps and websites you log in to using Facebook by:","Click on the arrow at the top right of any Facebook page and select Settings","Click Apps and Websites in the left column.","Review what apps and websites you have subscribed to using your Facebook account. Also review the permissions you have granted to these apps. Revoke permissions, unsubscribe and remove apps and services you are not using; or that don't meet your privacy needs.","Depart: Breaking up with Instagram and WhatsApp","As mentioned, if you want to more fully curtail the ways Facebook collects your data directly through their own services , then it is time to say goodbye to Instagram and WhatsApp.","How to delete Instagram","As with Facebook, Instagram offers the possibility to deactivate the account. If you’d just like to take a temporary break, this would be the option for you.","To actually delete your account you should, according to Instagram, use the Help page.","When you delete your account, your profile, photos, videos, comments, likes and followers will be permanently removed. After you delete your account, you can't sign up again with the same username or add that username to another account, and we can't reactivate deleted accounts.","To permanently delete your account:","Go to the Delete Your Account page. If you're not logged into Instagram on the web, you'll be asked to log in first. You can't delete your account from within the Instagram app.","Select an option from the drop-down menu next to Why are you deleting your account? and re-enter your password. The option to permanently delete your account will only appear after you've selected a reason from the menu.","How to delete WhatsApp","Enter your phone number in full international format and tap Delete my account.","Deleting your account will:","Delete your account from WhatsApp.","Erase your message history.","Delete you from all of your WhatsApp groups.","Delete your Google Drive or iCloud backup.","I’m off Facebook, now how do I stay in touch?","What to look for in an alternative?","Leaving Facebook is not about forcing yourself to stop communicating with people online. Rather, it’s about finding and building alternative channels of communication that take our privacy, and the privacy of others, into account! If you are making the big migration away from Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, what other options are out there? How do you know which companies to trust with your data? How do you choose an alternative that protects your privacy a little better?","When it comes to Facebook, the bad news is there’s no direct replacement. But the good news is that you can replace a lot of Facebook’s core services individually. For Facebook’s key services, like Messenger or WhatsApp, you can use a messaging alternative that doesn’t sell your data, like Signal. It’s easy to use and easy to invite others to use. That’s the key with social media platforms – they are social, so getting your friends, families or colleagues on to the same app is part of the plan.","In terms of looking around for other options, here are some handy tips:","The first criteria is whether the app is open source software, which means the source code behind the app can be seen by anyone, and independently audited to see if it works how it claims to work (e.g. that it implements proper encryption).","The second is what kind of encryption is available. When looking specifically at chat apps, end-to-end encryption means that your message is scrambled throughout its journey and can only be decrypted by the recipient and sender. Not all encryption works in the same way (e.g. some allows for the message to be decrypted en route), so it’s worth looking into the type of encryption the tool offers and what works best for your in your context.","It’s true that WhatsApp is encrypted, but that only covers the content of the message, not who is sending the message to who, where and when, nor how often. So even though messages themselves are still encrypted, there’s a lot of other information – sometimes more important information that is collected, stored and shared with Facebook to build your profile and sell for advertising.`","The third criteria is who owns the app. What is the business model of the app’s parent company? How long has it been around for? Is it likely to get bought out by another company? Is it likely to collaborate with governments? Are they known to sell your data for profit?","In addition to this, where is the company based? Different countries have different data protection laws, and where the app’s parent company is based determines the jurisdiction it operates within. Also try to find out where their servers are based, as this is where your data will actually be located and can impact how your data is governed.","And finally, does the service allow for any degree of anonymity? Do you have to provide your real name, email address, phone number or other identifiable information to use the service?","For mobile apps, always check permissions on your phone to see what information the app can access on your phone. Also consider if the access you are granting the app is necessary for its functionality. For example, why would a food delivery app need access to your contacts or your photo library?","_ This article was written by Leil-Zahra Mortada, with contributions from Stephanie Hankey, Ling Luther, Helen Kilbey._"],"isopubdate":""}

Parties in Europe, the United States and farther afield increasingly rely on digital advertising, largely on Facebook, to woo voters, Politico reports.","Over the last 18 months, Russian-backed groups and domestic digital tricksters also have used these online tactics. That includes against some 126 million U.S. voters who saw Facebook content produced by Russian-affiliated groups ahead of the 2016 presidential election, according to Facebook disclosures to American lawmakers.","“What they did was a straightforward strategy already used by advertisers selling toothpaste and shoes,” said Ben Scott, an outside technology adviser to Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 U.S. presidential campaign who recently analyzed the use of online misinformation in last year’s German election.","Digital rights groups have long criticized how much data tech companies can gather on their users, who are frequently offered “free” services in return for access to their online footprints. In the wake of the latest allegations about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, these organizations called on social networks to be held liable when users’ information is misused.","Such calls are likely to gain momentum. U.S. politicians are readying new legislation to regulate online political advertising on social networks, including mandating that companies disclose who pays for political ads online. In Europe, lawmakers are also pushing for rules to force tech companies to be more accountable when their platforms are used to spread online falsities or hate speech.","Many of these same lawmakers rely on sophisticated data analytics firms and lobbyists to reach potential voters to craft targeted advertising campaigns on social networks. But as the clamor to act increases, particularly from voters who may have had their data collected without their permission, politicians are likely to pressure tech companies, notably Facebook, to do more to address the potential online abuses.","Read alsoU.S. sanctions Russian \"troll factory\", 19 individuals for election meddling“These companies have grown very fast within the span of less than 10 years.

Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","Originally published on March 16, 2018:","We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.","We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies","Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","How Things Have Changed","We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.","In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time.","On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps.","We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

While the rich may be better positioned to travel and form relationships with people from other countries, the data showed that their friend networks mostly consist of domestic acquaintances.","These results align with a theory called the “restricting social class” hypothesis, which suggests that rich people have greater resources and thus depend less on others. Less of a need to rely on other people creates a greater tendency for the upper class to be less socially engaged, particularly with those from other socioeconomic groups than their own.","The researchers from the department of psychology at the University of Cambridge conducted a local study and a global study, both of which supported the \"restricting social class hypothesis.\" Impressively, the global study used a massive dataset of billions of Facebook friendships, allowing for a more comprehensive study than most.","The tendency of the upper class to stay in their own social bubbles could ultimately give the lower class a big advantage. “If you are not engaging internationally then you will miss out on that international resource — that flow of new ideas and information,” says Dr. Alexandre Spectre, the study’s co-author. Members of lower social classes may actually stand to benefit from a higher level of engagement in a highly international and globalized social world, the researchers say.","In the local study, the researchers worked with over 850 people in the United States and analyzed their Facebook networks. The results indicated that low-class participants had nearly 50 percent more international friends than high-class participants.","For the global study, Facebook provided the researchers with data on every friendship formed over the network in every country in the world at the national aggregate level in 2011. The dataset included over 57 billion friendships, and all data was kept anonymous.","“Previous research by others has highlighted the value of developing weak ties to people in distant social circles, because they offer access to resources not likely to be found in one’s immediate circle. I find it encouraging that low-social class people tend to have greater access to these resources on account of having more international friendship,” said study co-author Maurice Yearwood.","A radical facet of this study is that, 10 or so years ago, it would have been impossible. Big data and social media are revolutionizing the way researchers can analyze data. Spectre says we’re entering an era where researchers can start to ask the big questions and actually answer them in a way that was never feasible before.","Spectre commends Facebook for its “scientific spirit” and willingness to collaborate with his lab for research purposes — this is only the first output of ongoing research collaborations between the two. \"Having the opportunity to work with companies like Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google should be something that's hugely exciting to the academic community,\" he said.","Since it was recently discovered that not even half of 100 retested psychology studies could reproduce the same results, analyzing more comprehensive sets of data could lead to more legitimate findings. If more influential companies like Facebook cultivate a scientific spirit, studies in the future could yield excitingly accurate results."],"isopubdate":""}

The share plunge erased $5billion from the net worth of Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg as calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British firm hired by Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy called for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter. The two lawmakers said the companies “have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data” and that the lack of oversight “raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.”","Senator Ron Wyden asked Facebook to provide more information on what he called a “troubling” misuse of private data that could have been used to sway voters. Wyden said he wants to know how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook tools “to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.”","In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage. Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations “horrifying, if confirmed,” and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week. In Britain, parliamentary committee chair Damian Collins said both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had questions to answer.","“We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Collins said in a statement. Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee.” Alexander Nix is chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, which has denied misusing Facebook data for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research said the revelations highlight “systemic problems at Facebook,” but that they won’t immediately impact the social network’s revenues."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

London-based TheInternet.Foundation, a Non-Governmental Organisation dedicated to promoting digital rights, is leading changes in how personal data is used in commerce.","TheInternet.Foundation was created in 2013 by Dele Atanda, a digital visionary, entrepreneur and long-standing advocate of digital human rights. He is also a cyber and fintech expert, a crypto-economy theorist and an advocate of using technology to form a more compassionate, empathetic and human-centred world.","Back in 2013 TheInternet.Foundation (The IF) pioneered the call for a Universal Declaration of Digital Rights ratified by the United Nations. It leads the development and implementation of the initiative, with leading digital think tanks and consumer rights groups from around the world. In parallel, The IF also leads an initiative to establish a framework outlining how enterprises and brands can responsibly use consumers’ personal data in a fair and mutually equitable manner.","According to the world economic forum, it is estimated that by 2020 personal data will be worth €1trillion in Europe alone. Personal data is an incredibly valuable asset, and currently individuals neither own nor control their personal data or digital identity. There are a number of challenges surrounding personal data, and with the introduction of GDPR on May 25 2018, companies will have to change the way they collect, share and use customer information.","Dedicated to promoting universal digital rights as a natural extension of human rights, TheInternet.Foundation is set to make the use of personal data in commerce much more sustainable.","Dele Atanda commented on the importance of personal data management, “Today, you don’t own your data and you don’t own your identity, so the question really is – who does?”","Even before this latest scandal, the Equifax data breach in 2017 left over 143 million American citizens in a state of permanent, lifetime threat of identity theft, identity crime and identity exposure. Unfortunately, there is no solution except for them changing their identity. Their names, date of birth and social security numbers are now in unknown databases forever. Those identities are effectively owned by the company that compiled and created this information, and not by the individuals whose details were stolen. The stolen information was gathered through no willing participation of the hack’s victims and little has been done to rectify their exposure.","If you look at the history of financial profiles, you find the foundation of what is becoming pervasive commercial surveillance. The use of our data in this commercial framework – for example in advertising and sales – can make business models based on this ethically questionable.","Dele Atanda continues, “There is a fundamental conflict of interest for companies such as Facebook and Google when it comes to information provisioning and data sharing, because their business models are based on advertising. This in effect means the information they provide is based on advertiser interests, not truth or merit, which makes such information fundamentally unreliable at best and untrustworthy at worst. This is the heart of the crisis of fake news”.","The issues surrounding data are only going to get worse with the rise of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the internet of things. Dele Atanda explains, “As our buildings and cities become more connected, the internet of things becomes more prevalent and the 3D world becomes more digitized, these threats will rise exponentially. As data becomes the new oil, we are faced with increasingly prevalent surveillance commerce corporations in what we refer to as ‘The Dirty Data Economy’.”","“This year we will see the introduction of GDPR. It is perhaps the most significant piece of legislation of our generation and a complete reset of the digital economy.","“As people, we are social creatures that become richer by our ability to share experiences with each other. This is a great thing that should be celebrated, and the internet is a powerful and incredible tool that enables this. What we need is a framework to ensures we are able to use it in ways that enrich us that are not harmful. We should be able to share our thoughts and feelings with friends and family without this sharing being used to manipulate and exploit us.”","TheInternet.Foundation has created a “Clean Data Charter” – a self-regulating set of principles for companies to adopt, allowing for the fair and equitable use of data in commerce in contrast to the “Dirty Data” model of data acquired through surveillance commerce. It is partnering with the British Standards Institute to introduce an international Ethical Data Standard based on these principles. This will allow personal data to be used commercially in an ethical and sustainable manner.","Dele Atanda continues, “The three focuses of the Ethical Data Standard are privacy, ownership and consent. GDPR to a large extent addresses privacy and consent, but does not tackle ownership and it is data ownership that most urgently needs to be resolved. Personal data is personal property, which businesses must acknowledge and respect.","“We are creating a global framework that businesses will be able to use to do this. Self-regulation is one part of it and technology is the other. We are using cryptography and blockchain technologies to create a protocol – the mPod Protocol, that allows sealed data objects to be created by people and consensually accessed through tokens in marketplaces. By using encryption and tokens we can provide a data sharing model that is mutually beneficial for data owners and data seekers alike. Information can be protected and used in a universal and ethical standards based manner. People can choose how much exposure they are comfortable with and who they wish to share what with based on clear transparent value exchanges. We call this the ‘Clean Data’ framework analogous to Clean Energy in the ‘old oil’ economy.”","“As personal data is so valuable and personal we should be able to determine who has access to it, take part in its value exchange and earn equity from transactions should we so wish. By introducing the Clean Data framework, no one can exploit your personal information or use it without full transparency on what they wish to do with it and your clear consent for it to be used in this way.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The company, partly owned by major Trump supporter and donor Robert Mercer, was allegedly hired by the campaign to build targeted ads and potentially influence political opinion during the 2016 elections, using personal data harvested through a personality quiz on Facebook developed by Cambridge data scientist Aleksandr Kogan.","Safety Lock Cyber Privacy. Photo via Tumisu, Pixabay","A subsequent report by the UK’s Channel 4 featuring hidden camera footage showed Cambridge Analytica executives, including CEO Alexander Nix, as they described uncouth company practices to an undercover reporter posing as a potential customer. Company practices included bribery stings, prostitutes, and the use of Israeli companies and former Israeli spies to gather intelligence and information about voters. Israeli hackers also reportedly offered Cambridge Analytica hacked emails of politicians in Nigeria and the Caribbean island of St Kitts and Nevis who are now heads of state.","The revelations sparked outrage and public debate on ethical standards for social media companies turned powerful data gatherers and political consulting firms. The scandal also put a spotlight on Facebook’s failure to provide adequate privacy protection, for which Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg apologized – after days of silence – accusing Cambridge Analytica of “breach of trust” and listing actions taken by the tech giant to prevent such events from happening again.","Nevertheless, the US Federal Trade Commission, British authorities, and Israel’s Privacy Protection Authority (part of the Justice Ministry) all announced separate investigations into Facebook’s activities. Cambridge Analytica’s London offices were also raided by UK police.","And as the world grapples with the developments and their ramifications, and amid a global push for new privacy standards, questions abound on the social contract between technology companies and their users and the right to cyberprivacy.","In Israel, already a cybersecurity powerhouse, the cyberprivacy sector is a “burgeoning industry” notable for the development of software or technology aimed at enhancing the online privacy of users and companies. In 2017, there were 57 active privacy protection companies in Israel, covering areas like public key identification, VPN, permissions control, and digital footprint management, according to a Haaretz report from January. One Israeli company had even gone as far as undercutting Facebook and other tech companies, developing a “firewall to block facial recognition so that people could share pictures while still protecting their identity.","The rise of cyberprivacy","Israeli startup BigID, an early-stage company that just raised $14 million in a Series A funding round in January, claims it is “redefining data protection” and the cyberprivacy industry with a software that uses machine learning and identity intelligence technologies to help companies secure and track customer and employee data. BigID CTO and co-founder Nimrod Vax tells NoCamels he believes that technology has more of a relevant purpose in the future of digital privacy than contracts like the one that was breached between Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.","“Cambridge Analytica did violate legitimate use of data, but the bigger issue here is the lack of automation in today’s privacy,” he tells NoCamels, referring to the idea that technology should be responsible for privacy protection and not the human operator. Automation never fully eliminates the operator, but it does shift responsibility to the machine or technology, he explains.","Yoav Degani, CEO of the Israeli-founded MyPermissions (soon to rebrand as MyPrivacy) since 2016, echoes this sentiment, suggesting that social media users need a “bottom-up approach” where they can be proactive through private protection technology rather than waiting for Facebook to make policy changes.","“Maybe this is an opportunity to change people’s thinking about privacy — that they have solutions,” he tells NoCamels, “The key point is being proactive instead of reactive. Search for privacy tools, read permissions, look at the app description page.”","Degani says MyPermissions brings “awareness” to the social media user through its app, which provides an automatic personal cloud protection service that scans the online services and apps the user is connected to, alerts them in real time when apps gain permissions to personal information, and show them the best and quickest way to protect their data.","“Until they install our app, people don’t realize so many apps and services are running their data,” he adds.","“Technology did not stop the misuse of information and it was limited by a contract, so we saw the breach,” Jonathan Klinger, an Israeli-certified lawyer who works with Israeli startups on privacy, copyright, and information challenges, tells NoCamels, “In the case of Cambridge Analytica, the misuse of data occurred because the data the company received was in breach of contract. The contract was between Facebook and the researcher, who was specifically prohibited from sharing it.”","Is Facebook solely to blame?","Facebook may not have allowed Cambridge Analytica to use its data in the way it did, but it never enforced its own privacy policies, even when rumors persisted that the data analytics firm might have been doing something wrong, which there were indications of as early as 2015, the experts explain.","Social media apps on a smartphone. Photo via LoboStudioHamburg, Pixabay","“I believe that, because Facebook acted reasonably, but not in the best manner, it should be free of any liability,” says Klinger, who also volunteers as the legal counsel of the Digital Rights Movement, which acts to protect privacy and free speech in Israel.","“Facebook did request that its developers refrain from such use, and was unable to ensure in any other way that the information is used in a legitimate fashion. Had Facebook employed stricter security measures, then yes, it would be liable. This is the case where closing your eyes will set you free,” he says.","“What they need to change is how they share data in third-party [programs] so they will not expose or endanger their users,” Vax suggests, reiterating that today’s enforcement relies on contract when it should be relying on technology. “The role of technology is to automate those processes so it would be more robust.”","“You don’t need to wait for Facebook to make changes,” says Degani, “With one scan you could have seen that the [Facebook] quiz was taking your data. It’s just one of the many cases [of such breaches].”","Local enforcement and legislation","Another question that arises from the scandal is the role of government and law enforcement in securing personal data.","In the wake of the Facebook data case, the European Council, which regulates data privacy through the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), issued a warning at a summit in Brussels last Thursday saying that EU and national legislation must be respected and enforced by social networks and digital platforms. It didn’t specify Facebook by name.","While the GDPR was approved by the EU Parliament on April 14, 2016, its enforcement date is May 25, 2018 at which time a stricter European law will take effect and those organizations not in compliance will face heavy fines.","The UK data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, said it was investigating the Facebook case as part of a larger look into how personal data is analyzed for political campaign purposes. EU privacy regulators also said that “authorities from other member states are participating in a joint investigation led by the British watchdog.”","Israel meanwhile said its investigation into Facebook’s actions came “following the publications on the transfers of personal data from Facebook to Cambridge Analytica,” and amid “the possibility of other infringements of the privacy law regarding Israelis.”","According to Israeli Privacy Law, personal data may only be used for the purpose for which it was given, with the consent of the individual,” said the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority, adding that it will “investigate whether personal data of Israeli citizens were illegally used in a way that infringes upon their right to privacy and the provisions [of the law].”","For Israel to have jurisdiction, “they’ll need to show that the data [belonged to] Israeli nationals, as well as that the data was used against Israeli law. Israeli law is a bit more lenient than EU laws, and therefore I’m not sure that the use was made in violation of Israeli law,” Klinger explains.","“I think that the [Israeli Privacy Protection Authority] needed to respond to a media crisis instead of seeking action against other entities that do harm Israeli nationals’ privacy on a daily basis,” he says."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The hubris accumulated from the achievements is now plain to see. Zuckerberg seems either oblivious to - or incapable of assuming - the responsibilities that come with running an enterprise of extraordinary political, cultural and social influence.","It is evident even in the company’s lame response to the latest imbroglio. The New York Times and Observer of London chronicled, with the help of a whistleblower, how political consultancy Cambridge Analytica exploited Facebook user information. Worse, they say Facebook knew about it and failed to alert customers. The tin-eared first lines of defense over such harrowing claims were to argue that what occurred was not technically a “data breach” and to belatedly suspend the firm’s account.","Responses from outside Facebook were notably, and deservedly, more severe. U.S. legislators called for investigations into the leaks. Democrat Senator Amy Klobuchar demanded Zuckerberg appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on which she sits. A conservative British lawmaker called for him to testify in a parliamentary inquiry over Russian meddling in the UK referendum to leave the European Union. For over a year, Zuckerberg has been ducking such requests even as he embarked on a road trip across America last year to meet people in every state.","Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn’t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation.

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

Suggesting that the money would come on stream this year, she said: “I would suggest we can’t wait until next Easter [when the next financial year will start].” At the weekend a report in the Sunday Times (paywall) said there was a plan to announce an extra £4bn for the NHS annually in the summer. May was not asked about this figure, and did not suggest how much extra the NHS might get. She was also not asked about reports the government is considering introducing a new hypothecated tax to fund the increase.","May hinted that the government has now realised that setting up new customs arrangements after Brexit could take longer than expected. This is what she said in response to a question from the Conservative Nicky Morgan, who said HM Revenue and Customs told her Treasury committee that a new customs partnership with the EU could take five years to set up.","We are looking at different potential customs arrangements for the future in order to deliver on the commitments that we have made. We are now the point at being able to look in more detail with the European commission at some of those proposals. And I think it is fair to say that, as we get into the detail and as we look at these arrangements, then what becomes clear is that sometimes the timetables that have originally been set are not the timetables that are necessary when you actually start to look at the detail and when you delve into what it really is that you want to be able to achieve.","But she does want to come forward with a long-term funding plan for the NHS. She says she does not think it should have to rely on annual funding top-ups.","But she says she does not think having a commission (the proposal in the letter) is the right way ahead.","May says she wants to produce a long-term plan to improve NHS funding. It should not be reliant on annual top-ups, she says.","Dan Bloom (@danbloom1)","May says there'll be \"proposals in advance of next year’s spending review\" to \"enable the NHS to plan much more effectively and efficiently in the future\".

The code generates a miniscule image the size of one pixel, the smallest visual element on a digital screen, and indiscernible to the human eye.","Facebook currently allows its advertisers to create targeted marketing using Facebook pixels to tally the number of Facebook users who view their ads on the site, monitor sales conversions, and obtain surfing histories.","Once the pixel loads into a browser, it can send back the user's IP address and web activity to the advertising website's server. Outside Facebook, pixels are commonly used in the web analytics world to implement targeted advertising.","In the new set of recommendations, the Belgian regulator expressed its concern over Facebook obtaining excessive personal data for targeted advertising. It also reasserted its position that Facebook excessively tracks internet users without giving them adequate controls in the form of informed consent.","The Dutch data regulator announced earlier that Facebook violated Dutch privacy law on the same grounds. However, rather than imposing a fine, it worked with Facebook on a corrective measure that the company has implemented, although it does not address all the regulator's concerns.","France's data regulator announced that it had fined Facebook €150,000 ($168m) for violating its data-protection rules but did not opt to work with Facebook on implementing any changes.","Europe's dispute with Facebook did not stop there. The European Commission also fined Facebook €110m ($123m) for misleading regulators on how it matches WhatsApp users' data with Facebook accounts to create targeted advertisements.","Like the Netherlands, Belgium has not imposed a fine on Facebook.

{"originalurl":"https://woostermediagroup.com/will-data-breach-drive-marketers-away/","title":"Will Facebook's data breach drive marketers from the platform? | Wooster Media Group","text":["Will Facebook’s data breach drive marketers from the platform?","When a whistleblower revealed Cambridge Analytica had improperly used data on 50 million Facebook users, there was an uproar. Will the data breach drive digital marketers from the platform? I have been struggling trying to understand the issue and what it means for digital marketers — and their clients — moving forward.","The data breach background","A whistleblower accused the British firm of Cambridge Analytica of harvesting data from 50 million Facebook profiles to help shape people’s behaviors. The company’s work has been said to help Donald J. Trump win the presidency in the United States and to lead voters in England to approve the leaving of the European Union (aka Brexit).","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","So, what does this mean?","I wish I knew. I am a walking contradiction. I am a private person, yet very public. What I mean is I share what I want to share online, but there are things I don’t. Essentially, information is power. The more a company knows about my likes, desires, loves, passions, fears and apprehension, the better it can give me what I want. The better companies can target me, the greater the likelihood I will spend money with them.","In other words, companies can better target products and services to me if they understand me. Cambridge Analytica’s uses of data analytics is nothing new. Just about every website uses Google Analytics to understand behavior of users who visits.","Search engine optimization is a core function of what I provide clients. There are several ways to optimize, here are few:","An SEO audit can be performed on a website to make sure it loads quickly, has the right schema markup language, has the right meta descriptions, page titles, and more;","Individual blog posts can be optimized to rank higher in search engine results; and","Photos can be optimized to load faster and contain the right information in the ALT text.","The ultimate goal of optimization is to increase the likelihood of converting a website visitor into a customer. Optimizing a site, a post or a photo, increases engagement and the possibility of doing business. In short, optimizing helps guide and direct behavior.","Will digital marketers exit Facebook because of the data breach?","In a piece published by Adweek, the thinking was probably not.","The gist of the problem: Facebook’s data is powerful and its ads work with hyper-precision targeting and incomparable reach in digital advertising across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook Audience Network (or FAN). According to eMarketer’s latest report, Facebook will generate $21 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue in 2018, up 16.9 percent year-over-year. In other words, Facebook’s tentacles reach so deep into digital advertising that it’s nearly impossible for brands to ditch the platform altogether.","Still, it’s not clear if the data allegations will spook consumers from using the platform, which would change audience sizes for advertisers.","And, therein lies the rub: Cambridge Analytica might have gotten a leg up because of the data breach, but there is still a lot of useful data collected by Facebook to help businesses target the right people. The information collected by Facebook isn’t anything new; Google has perfected this data collection, and it puts the information to good use in its Gmail service, in its search results, through mobile apps and more.","The data collected allows for more efficient marketing and advertising. Think of it this way: When you purchase an ad in a newspaper, you are paying for it to appear in every single copy of that particular edition. In digital marketing, you get to pick a target audience. I usually focus on people who are interested in small business and entrepreneurship. I think they are the ones who might have use of my services. However, I will not only target them. There are times I will target those who like my Facebook page and their friends. This casts a wider net.","Where do we go from here?","If you are concerned about the Facebook data breach, you can take action. Here is how you can download your information from Facebook to see what it has collected.","I downloaded my data, all 1.9 gigabytes of it. I did not encounter any horror stories like others have reported. I saw one person write about how Facebook had collected text messages with his mother-in-law. My data was basically an archive of every message, every post, every video and every photo I have shared on Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.”","The company’s response to the Ars Technica story, however, struck a different tone, with Facebook titling the post “Fact Check: Your Call and SMS History.” It said “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,” before going on to explain that call and text history logging is included with an opt-in feature on Messenger or Facebook Lite for Android that “people have to expressly agree to use” and that they can turn off at any time, which would also delete any call and text data shared with that app.","Ars Technica has already amended its original post with a response to Facebook’s statement, saying it contradicts several of its findings, including the experience of users who shared their data with the publication.","“In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used,” wrote Ars Technica IT and national security editor Sean Gallagher in the amendment to his post. “Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.”","In its statement, Facebook said “Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with. This was first introduced in Messenger in 2015, and later offered as an option in Facebook Lite, a lightweight version of Facebook for Android.”","When people first sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android or log into Messenger on an Android device, they see a screen giving them the option to continuously upload contacts as well as call and text history. Facebook added that on Messenger, users are then given three options: to turn the feature on, “learn more” for more information or “not now” to skip it. On Facebook Lite, they get two options: turn it on or skip. If users who opted in change their minds later, Facebook said they could turn it off in the app’s settings, with the option of turning off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled or deleting all contact information they’ve uploaded from that app.”","An image included with Facebook’s statement.","Facebook emphasized in bold text that it “never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.”","Even though the opt-in screens do state that granting permission will “continuously upload info” about contacts and call and text history, it is arguable that many users don’t really understand what that means and that instead of saying “this lets friends find each other on Facebook and helps us create a better experience for everyone” (a message sweetened with a saccharine cartoon of a figure texting a little heart), Facebook should really be giving more details about what exactly will be recorded and why.","With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still fresh on everyone’s minds, Facebook’s apparent willingness to place the onus for protecting personal data on users who already feel victimized is unlikely to help them regain any goodwill. But even people who truly understand the implications of the feature and chose to opt-in anyway did so assuming that their data would be guarded as Facebook promised. As the Cambridge Analytica fiasco threw into sharp relief, that hasn’t always been the case."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

Would Snapchat let you post back to your account from other services?","A Snap spokesperson declined to comment, and the company is likely thinking a lot about those very questions, given the current climate around privacy sharing. Hopefully, Snapchat will learn from Facebook‘s mistakes whenever it decides to roll this out.","Until now, Snap has stayed pretty far out of the spotlight when it comes to data collection and user privacy, probably because so many of the interactions on Snap are in private messages.

This comes as a huge embarrassment for the Congress party as it had earlier vehemently denied any connections with the firm which, along with social networking site Facebook, is in the spotlight for the global row over the alleged unauthorised access to personal data of the social media website's users. Earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had alleged that the Congress had engaged with Cambridge Analytica to run party president's Rahul Gandhi's election campaign.","Christopher Wylie, who is the whistleblower and a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, deposed in front of a Parliamentary Committee in the UK and admitted on camera that the firm had \"extensively\" worked in India and had an office here. \"I believe their client was Congress but I know that they have done all kinds of project. I don't remember a national project but I know regionally. India's so big that one state can be as big as Britain. But they do have offices there, they do have staff,\" Wylie reportedly told the digital, culture, media and sports committee in the House of Commons. Government issues notice to Cambridge Analytica over Facebook data breach, demands response by March 31","The whistleblower has reportedly also claimed that he had documentary proof for the CA's activities in India. Such evidence could probably establish a connection between the CA and the Congress.","Meanwhile, shortly after it emerged that the Indian National Congress had indeed used the services of disgraced firm Cambridge Analytica, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday hit back at the Rahul Gandhi-led party, demanding that it must apologise for lying to the nation. Union Law Minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters here that Rahul Gandhi has been exposed who has been trying to lie to the nation and divert attention from the Facebook user data breach scandal. “The Congress party must apologise, Rahul Gandhi must also apologise. No more alibi would absolve the Congress party of blatant lies,” Prasad said, adding today’s developments prove the Congress had got into a deal with a shady firm that was seeking to influence voters.","Just a few days ago, Congress spokesperson Divya Spandana had told Times Now that the party had no involvement with the controversial as its ideologies did not match with Cambridge Analytica and also did not have the requisite funds for such activities.","In fact, previously, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala had confidently stated that neither Congress party nor Rahul Gandhi \"had never bought or hired services of the company called Cambridge Analytica.\" He had added that allegations by Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad about the possible links between Congress and the contentious firm were \"false propaganda\" and a \"white lie\". BJP diverting from main issues again, alleges Cong President Rahul Gandhi on data theft charge","On Thursday, the Law Minister had alleged that the recently concluded Gujarat elections had an 'imprint of Cambridge Analytica' on it. Addressing a press conference, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had alleged that despite reports suggesting Congress' engagement with Cambridge Analytica, the party remained silent for almost five months. Prasad said that newspaper reports had in October and November 2017 suggested Congress engaging Cambridge Analytica for election campaigns. \"If the Congress maintains silence on the involvement of a dubious company in their campaign, much can be said about their ability to run the country,\" Prasad said.","On the other hand, the Congress has also accused the BJP of having links with the allegedly dubious firm, a charge denied by the BJP.","Meanwhile, The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an independent government body charged with ensuring that companies abide by their own privacy policies, is looking at whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree after media reports alleged that it had handed the data of millions of users to a political consultancy.","Reports had also alleged that Cambridge Analytica used data mined from Facebook in the voter research it conducted for President Donald Trump during the 2016 elections campaign.

That joke is only 15 years old, but seems as if it is from an entirely different era. Once upon a time the internet was associated with anonymity; today it is synonymous with surveillance. Not only do modern technology companies know full well you’re not a dog (not even an extremely precocious poodle), they know whether you own a dog and what sort of dog it is. And, based on your preferred category of canine, they can go a long way to inferring – and influencing – your political views.","Just over a week ago, the Observer broke a story about how Facebook had failed to protect the personal information of tens of millions of its users. The revelations sparked a #DeleteFacebook movement and some people downloaded their Facebook data before removing themselves from the social network. During this process, many of these users were shocked to see just how much intel about them the internet behemoth had accumulated. If you use Facebook apps on Android, for example – and, even inadvertently, gave it permission – it seems the company has been collecting your call and text data for years.","It’s not me, it’s you! So Facebook protested, in the wake of widespread anger about its data-collection practices. You acquiesced to our opaque privacy policies.

Download all the information Google has on you","You may well have downloaded your Facebook data already; it has become something of a trend in recent days. Now take a look at what Google has on you. Go to Google’s “Takeout” tool and download your data from the multiple Google products you probably use, such as Gmail, Maps, Search and Drive. You’ll get sent a few enormous files that contain information about everything from the YouTube videos you have watched, your search history, your location history and so on. Once you’ve seen just how much information about you is in the cloud, you may want to go about deleting it. I highly recommend deleting your Google Maps history, for a start, unless you are particularly eager to have a detailed online record of everywhere you have ever been. You may also want to stop Google from tracking your location history. Sign in to Google, open Maps, then click on “timeline” in the menu. At the bottom, there’s an option to manage your location history.","Not only are most of these gadgets unnecessary and expensive, most of them have shoddy security and are a liability. In 2016, for example, hackers created a zombie army of internet-connected devices and used them to take down large parts of the internet, including sites such as Netflix, Facebook, Spotify and the Guardian. So think twice about whether you really need to buy that fancy connected gadget. There’s enough to worry about today without having to wonder if your toaster is plotting against you.","3. Ensure your AirDrop settings are dick-pic-proof","If you are an iPhone user, turn off your AirDrop function while in a public place or limit it to contacts. This stops strangers on the train from sending you unsolicited dick pics via AirDrop, which is a thing that actually happens because of course it does.","4. Secure your old Yahoo account","You may have an old email account you never use any more and can’t be bothered to delete. That email account is a treasure trove of personal information just waiting to be hacked; indeed, if it’s a Yahoo account it was hacked in 2013. You don’t need necessarily to delete your old account but you should secure it. Change the password and turn on two-step verification. Make sure you’ve disconnected any linked services (such as cloud storage) in your settings.","6. Check if you have been pwned","“Pwned” is internet-speak for, among other things, having your email account compromised in a data breach. It’s a good idea to check this regularly. Simply go to haveibeenpwned.com, enter your email address, and the website will let you know if and when your details have been compromised so you can take appropriate action such as changing your password.","7. Be aware of personalised pricing","We’re all familiar with dynamic pricing – the annoying way in which airline ticket prices fluctuate according to supply and demand. Increasingly, however, we’re seeing the rise of “personalised pricing”, as retailers analyse our data to gauge how much we’re likely to pay and charge us accordingly. Uber, for example, knows that you’re more likely to pay surge pricing if your phone battery is about to die – although they claim not to have acted on this information. And Staples has displayed different prices to customers based on their location. It’s hard to know just how widespread personalised pricing is as retailers are understandably discreet about it. However, you should assume that it’s happening. So, before making a big purchase online you might want to see if using a different device or using the incognito or private mode in your browser has any effect on the price. There are also tools you can download that let you spoof your location. It’s the modern equivalent of haggling.","8. Say hi to the NSA guy spying on you via your webcam","Even spooks need a little social interaction.","9. Turn off notifications for anything that’s not another person speaking directly to you","Sometimes this will be easy: is it a single-player game? It doesn’t need notifications at all. You can find out if you’ve got more gems, or extra energy – or whatever other fake currency the game hopes you will care about – in your own time, not when it wants to drive your engagement. Other times, this will be harder. Instagram’s rubbish – “a famous dog just posted a picture that received 12 likes” – can be turned off, but you’ll have to dig down in the settings to find it. Are there exceptions? Sure. The odd breaking news alert never hurt anyone, and maybe you really do want to let Duolingo prod you to practise your Spanish. But if you would be annoyed by a robot calling you up to tell you something, why are you letting it interrupt your thought process in another way?","10. Never put your kids on the public internet","Maybe it’s fine to upload pics to a shared (private) photo album, or mention their day in a group DM. But if it’s public, Google can find it. And if Google can find it, it’s never going away. How are you going to tell your child in 16 years’ time that they can’t get a drivers’ licence because Daddy put a high-res photo of their iris online when they were two and now they trip alarms from here to Mars?","11. Leave your phone in your pocket or face down on the table when you’re with friends","Unless you want to signal, repeatedly and obviously: “I would rather be hanging with someone else than you.”","12. Sometimes it’s worth just wiping everything and starting over","Your phone, your tweets, your Facebook account: all of these things are temporary. They will pass. Free yourself from an obsession with digital hoarding. If you wipe your phone every year, you learn which apps you need and which are just sitting in the background hoovering up data. If you wipe your Facebook account every year, you learn which friends you actually like and which are just hanging on to your social life like a barnacle.","14. Have as many social-media-free days in the week as you have alcohol-free days","This can be zero if you want, but know that we’re judging you.","15. Retrain your brain to focus","Save up your longreads using Instapaper or Pocket and read them without distraction. Don’t dip in and out of that 4,000-word article on turtles: read it in one go. Or maybe even try a book!","16. Don’t let the algorithms pick what you do","You are not a robot, you are a human being, and exercising your own free will is the greatest strength you have. When that YouTube video ends, don’t watch the next one that autoplays. When you pick up your phone in the morning, don’t just click on the stories at the top of Apple News or Google Now. Exercise choice! Exercise freedom! Exercise humanity!","Be a pioneer – delete Facebook | Jaron Lanier","Read more","17. Do what you want with your data, but guard your friends’ info with your life","Yes, you should think twice before granting that fun app you downloaded access to your location or your photo library. Do you trust it not to do weird things with your pictures? Do you know it won’t track your every movement? But ultimately, those are your decisions, and they are for you to make. But your friends’ data isn’t yours, it’s theirs, and you are a trusted custodian. Don’t think twice before authorising access to your address book, or your friends’ profiles: think five or six times, and then don’t do it.","18. Finally, remember your privacy is worth protecting","You might not have anything to hide (except your embarrassing Netflix history) but that doesn’t mean you should be blase about your privacy. Increasingly, our inner lives are being reduced to a series of data points; every little thing we do is for sale. As we’re starting to see, this nonstop surveillance changes us. It influences the things we buy and the ideas we buy into. Being more mindful of our online behaviour, then, isn’t just important when it comes to protecting our information, it’s essential to protecting our individuality."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

That was then.","Oh, how the mighty Zuck’s image has fallen amid scandalous revelations about the social network allowing consultants for Donald Trump's presidential campaign to gain access to personal information on millions of Facebook users.","Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told CNN Thursday that he \"doesn't remember\" purchasing personal information from Facebook while working for the data firm Cambridge Analytica, where he once served as a vice president.","But Bannon did express a novel version of an often-used Trumpian deflection that I call “BBOF,” or “blame Barack Obama first.”","“In 2008, it was Google and Facebook that went to Barack Obama and met him at San Francisco airport and told him all about the power of this personal data,” he said. Yet, \"the great opposition party — media — never went after the Obama campaign, never went after the progressive left as they've been doing this for years. And in 2013, when I thought a data company might be important, all the sudden it becomes global news.\"","Bannon’s view already was going viral on the political right. “Liberal media,” shouted a Fox News website headline, “didn’t think data mining was so bad when Obama’s campaign did it.”","“What’s genius for Obama is scandal when it comes to Trump,” said a headline on a column by conservative Ben Shapiro in The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper.","And numerous other developers, including the makers of such games as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, also used the same Facebook developer tool that Cambridge Analytica used.","However, as former Obama advisers point out, there are significant differences between the way Obama’s campaign mined data from Facebook, and the activities of which Cambridge is accused: The Obama campaign collected data with its own campaign app, complied with Facebook’s terms of service and, most important in my view, received permission from users before using the data.","An estimated 1 million Obama supporters gave the campaign access to their Facebook data in order to spread the word about their campaign. Campaign officials say they kept the data secure and did not sell or give it to third parties, although there have been some allegations that Facebook released at least some of that data anyway, without permission.","Cambridge, by comparison, has been accused of violating Facebook rules. The firm has suspended CEO Alexander Nix, pending an investigation.","Nix, you may recall, unintentionally added juice to this story by getting caught in an undercover sting video conducted against Cambridge Analytica by Britain’s Channel 4. Viewers around the world saw Nix claim credit for Trump’s election and appear to offer to entrap the client’s political rivals with secret videotapes and sex workers.","Facebook has taken heat from Trump’s critics too. They have accused the company of contributing to Trump’s victory by failing to rein in fake news and Russian propaganda. The latest scandal has brought new calls for Zuckerberg to testify before Congress and clarify how customer data is being used and possibly misused.","On Wednesday, after remaining conspicuously silent since Friday night, Zuckerberg promised to restrict third-party access to Facebook data in an effort to win back user trust. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” he wrote on Facebook.","Well said, but we’ve heard such earnest mea culpas from Zuckerberg before. Fast Company has compiled a list of almost a dozen other apologies Zuck has issued since 2003. “Like any habitual sinner,” opines Politico’s media columnist Jack Shafer, “he sins, seeks forgiveness in confession, and then with that naughty boy expression pasted on his face, he goes forth and sins again.”","Will he get away with it again? We’ve seen this dance before. Everybody hates Zuckerberg, yet we also love what his company has brought to us. Like a lot of tech wizards or major corporate CEOs, he likes to push the limits and worry about apologies later.","Perhaps this time, we the public will push back hard enough to rein in Facebook’s seductive power with appropriate regulations, beginning with the requirement that they get our permission before collecting and sharing our data with third parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

In what legal experts say may be a “watershed” case, a US citizen is using British laws to try to discover how he was profiled and potentially targeted by the Trump campaign.","David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York, has discovered a transatlantic legal mechanism that he hopes will give him access to information being sought by both the FBI and the Senate intelligence committee. In recent weeks, investigators looking at how people acting on behalf of Russia targeted American voters have focused on Trump’s data operation. But although the FBI obtained a court order against Facebook to make it disclose evidence, the exact way in which US citizens were profiled and targeted remains largely unknown.","But British data protection laws may provide some transparency on the company at the heart of Trump’s data operation – Cambridge Analytica – and how it created profiles of 240 million Americans. In January, Carroll discovered he – and a group of other citizens – had the right under UK law to ask for his personal data back from the company, and when it failed to supply it, he started filing pre-trial actions to sue the company under British law. The lawsuit is the result of a unique situation, according to Ravi Naik of Irvine Thanvi Natas, the British solicitor who is leading the case. It arose because although Cambridge Analytica is largely owned by Trump’s biggest donor, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and though its vice-president at the time of the US election was Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the company was spun out of an older British military and elections contractor, SCL, with which it still shares staff, directors and a London office.","In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever","Ravi Naik","Naik says: “It’s this fascinating situation because when it became apparent that Cambridge Analytica had processed Americans’ data in Britain, it suddenly opened up this window of opportunity. In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever, but the data protection framework is set up in such a way that it doesn’t matter where people are: it matters where the data is processed.","“I’m a human rights practitioner and in the past most of my cases were national security issues, but increasingly it’s about data protection and the way people are affected by the misuse of their data. I see this as an issue affecting fundamental rights and it’s taking citizen activism to uncover what’s going on, to request data. I really hear echoes of the civil rights movement in people becoming more aware, more resistant and willing to fight.”","As an academic, Carroll had studied advertising, data and design, but he was still shocked when Cambridge Analytica eventually sent him a “profile” that it had created about him though not the data it was created from. “It was very strange and unsettling because they had given me ‘scores’ for different issues but I had no idea what they’d based this on.” The company scored him 3/10 on “Gun Rights Importance”, 7/10 on “National Security Importance” and “unlikely” to vote Republican.","“I was perplexed by it. I started thinking, ‘Have I had conversations about gun rights on Facebook? Where are they getting this from? And what are they doing with it?’” He reported the firm to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which is investigating the use of data in political campaigning; he has also launched a CrowdJustice campaign and is appealing to the public to help him take the case as far as he can through the British courts.","It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations","Frank Pasquale, University of Maryland","“There are so many disturbing aspects to this. One of the things that really troubles me is how the company can buy anonymous data completely legally from all these different sources, but as soon as it attaches it to voter files, you are re-identified. It means that every privacy policy we have ignored in our use of technology is a broken promise. It would be one thing if this information stayed in the US, if it was an American company and it only did voter data stuff.”","But, he argues, “it’s not just a US company and it’s not just a civilian company”. Instead, he says, it has ties with the military through SCL – “and it doesn’t just do voter targeting”. Carroll has provided information to the Senate intelligence committee and believes that the disclosures mandated by a British court could provide evidence helpful to investigators.","Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland, author of The Black Box Society and a leading expert on big data and the law, called the case a “watershed moment”.","“It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations. I think we will look back and see it as a really significant case in terms of the future of algorithmic accountability and data protection. These issues are so critical and in the US there are only these incredible, lethargic data laws largely because of the incredible power of the lobbying industry.”","Big data’s power is terrifying. That could be good news for democracy | George Monbiot","Read more","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician who has created the firm PersonalData.IO to help people reclaim their data, and who helped Carroll with his quest, said it was important that people realised that there are tools they can use against big corporations.","“In the US election, the FBI has been trying to get information from the top down but this doesn’t help with regard to the French election or Brexit,” Dehaye said. “And we know we just cannot trust Facebook, even with good intent, to run our elections fairly. There are a few huge companies amassing vast amounts of data on vast amounts of people and there’s no democratic oversight.”","Pasquale said news that Facebook information had been used by Russian agents to target US citizens may prove to be a tipping point. “It shows this information has now been weaponised by a state actor. What we’re seeing is really a failure of the first order. Mark Zuckerberg wrote this 6,000-word letter about creating a global political community and yet we now know that Facebook was a platform for a devastating attack on the most robust democracy in the world.”"],"isopubdate":"2017-09-30"}

Tajani urged the social media company to take more responsibility, saying on Twitter that “allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens’ privacy rights”.","In the US, a state attorney general has called for investigations, greater accountability and regulation, while the head of the parliamentary committee in the UK investigating fake news accused Cambridge Analytica and Facebook of misleading MPs, with the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport warning of an end to the “wild west” of technology firms.","Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach","Read more","“The allegations are clearly very concerning. It’s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way,” May’s spokesman said.","“So it is absolutely right the information commissioner is investigating this matter and we expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.”","In a statement Facebook said: “We have hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems. We remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Cambridge Analytica said: “In 2014 we received Facebook data and derivatives of Facebook data from another company, GSR, that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research. After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook.","The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, told the House of Commons that the revelations were “clearly very worrying” and the government was considering additional powers that the commissioner had proposed, including powers to impose further criminal sanctions and to compel testimony from individuals. Hancock said he was shocked at the speed at which Facebook had barred the whistleblower, Chris Wylie, from its platforms, including WhatsApp.","“I thought it was outrageous,” he said. “Facebook have some serious questions to answer here, and they will tell their side of the story. And to answer it by blocking an account, when we know in this house they do not act fast enough to block other accounts of obviously outrageous behaviour, I’ll tell you what, it shows that when they need to they can block things incredibly quickly and they will need to do a lot more that.”","However, Hancock said he had not seen any evidence that the activities had had an effect on the outcome of any election or referendum.","Labour’s Stephen Kinnock said that if Cambridge Analytica were proved to have been “in flagrant breach of our electoral rules, that would place a pretty huge question mark over the referendum result”.","Damian Collins MP, who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would call the heads of both companies, Mark Zuckerberg and Alexander Nix, to give further testimony.","“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","Collins suggested the powers of the information commissioner should be beefed up to add the legal ability to force companies to provide information.","Downing Street said it would consider any formal requests to give new powers to the commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, but added her powers had only recently been reviewed.","“I haven’t seen any formal requests. The information commissioner does have significant powers, which have been enhanced in recent times, but if any formal requests were made to us I’m sure we’d consider it,” the spokesman said.","Last month both Facebook representatives and Nix had told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from Global Science Research (GSR). But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.","Profile","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica","Nix worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman.","Controversies","Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison","Photograph: The Washington Post","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","“In 2015 we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ‘platform policies’ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” the statement said.","Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign paid Cambridge Analytica more than $6.2m, according to US federal election commission records but is has denied using any Facebook data in the campaign.","In a now-deleted series of tweets, Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, argued that the friend list data that Cambridge Analytica had acquired was obtained through an API, a feature that allows programs to interface with Facebook, that was well documented “in our terms of service, platform documentation, the privacy settings and the screen used to login to apps”.","On Saturday evening, however, he deleted his tweets, saying: “I should have done a better job weighing in. There are a lot of big problems that the big tech companies need to be better at fixing,. We have collectively been too optimistic about what we build and our impact on the world.

With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand.","Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network.","He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them.","“Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it.","“Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.”","Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland.","(NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.)","The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges.","The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results).","And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value — and led to a bunch of lawsuits.","“We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on.","“Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.”","He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account.","So, er, ouch.","In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner himself as, er, hostile to privacy…","A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement:","We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further.","This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions.","Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!).","The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning.","Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook.","Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period.","Downloaded FB data also gives you insight into whom else has data on you (used to run custom audiences). Have never engaged with 75% of these… pic.twitter.com/dQPjIcI8CW","“I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.”","Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot.","But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users.","“They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.”","“Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large.","“It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?”","“They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks. If you think about how antitrust laws work, that’s the starting point for those laws. So it’s kind of mindboggling that they don’t see their argumentation, how it’s going to hurt them at some point.”","*DISCLAIMER - What sets us apart from other online business opportunities is our world class system and methods, as well as our integrity - so we want you to know exactly where you stand.

If users had not adjusted their privacy settings on the social media outlet, however, the app didn’t just capture the survey responses — it also gathered as much data from each account as possible.","That data included information from Facebook users’ friends and contacts, as well.","\"So by you filling out my survey I capture 300 records on average right,\" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. \"And so that means that, all of a sudden, I only need to engage 50,000, 70,000, 100,000 people to get a really big data set really quickly, and it’s scaled really quickly. We were able to get upwards of 50 million plus Facebook records in the span of a couple of months.\"","Similar stories based on the same reporting also appeared in the New York Times and the Observer of London.","According to Wylie, the project was of particular importance to Steve Bannon, who later served as the chief executive of Trump's campaign. He added that the former head of the right-wing media organization Breitbart wanted to use the data netted by Cambridge Analytica to influence and galvanize the views of the American public.","\"Steve wanted weapons for his culture war, that’s what he wanted,\" Wylie said.","\"We offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do, which was change the culture of America,\" Wylie added.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman refuted all of Wylie's claims, calling his decision to speak to the media \"a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"","\"We were forced to take action against Mr. Christopher Wylie to prevent his misuse of the company's intellectual property and he is the subject of restraining undertakings in this regard,\" the spokesman said. \"It is clear that he has a grudge to bear and appears set on trying to damage the company.\"","But Wylie said in the initial interview that this wasn’t about getting back at Cambridge Analytica, noting that \"if it was about revenge I could have done this years ago.\"","Instead, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of research calls his whistleblowing a crisis of conscience.","\"It weighs on me that I played a pivotal role in setting up a company that I think has done a lot of harm to the democratic process in a lot of countries,\" Wylie said.","The idea behind the project was that political preferences can be predicted by personal details people voluntarily provide on their social media accounts. By analyzing the details that users share online, Cambridge Analytica could predict individual behavior, which included voter preferences and how to influence that preference.","CEO of Cambridge Analytica Alexander Nix speaks at the 2016 Concordia Summit - Day 1 at the Grand Hyatt New York on Sep. 19, 2016 in New York City.Bryan Bedder / Getty Images for Concordia Summit","\"Whenever you go and you like something you are giving me a clue as to who you are as a person,\" Wylie said. \"And so all of this can be captured very easily and run through an algorithm that learns who you are.\"","Wylie said that \"almost none\" of the people whose profiles were tapped were aware that Cambridge Analytica had harvested their data.","The research all began in 2013 at Cambridge University, according to ITN Channel 4 News, where the university's psychometrics center began to examine the psychology behind Facebook and what information could be gleaned by pulling the data from user profiles.","According to Wylie, Bannon hoped to use that research and replicate it on a massive scale across the American electorate to buoy his influence campaign in 2014 and again in the 2016 presidential campaign. Billionaire Republican donors Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebecca — who own a portion of Cambridge Analytica — put Bannon in contact with the founder of the method, Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan, ITN Channel 4 News.","\"Kogan didn’t make any money off of it, he didn't,\" Wylie said. \"He did it for free, and what he got out of it was the giant data set and what [Cambridge Analytica] got out of it was also data, everyone got data. But Cambridge Analytica paid for it directly.\"","Cambridge Analytica appeared to lay the blame on Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), which is not associated with Cambridge University.","\"This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement issued Saturday.","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" the statement added.","According to ITN Channel 4 News, Kogan said he held the right to use the data for commercial purposes and did nothing wrong.","Meanwhile, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million to help target voters. The company told NBC News mere days before the 2016 election that it held data on 230 million American adults with approximately 4,000 “data points” on each of them.","The company denied, however, using any data that was harvested from Facebook via Kogan’s methods to help the Trump campaign.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the company added in Saturday's statement.","Facebook said in a statement that \"Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook.\" The social media provider added that Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan had told the company that all the data initially obtained by the app had been destroyed.","\"In light of new reports that the data was not destroyed, we are suspending these three parties from Facebook, pending further information,\" Facebook said. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties.\"","The social media company also insists that this did not constitute a data breach, as users technically consented — via their privacy settings — to allow Cambridge Analytica to harvest their data.","But Wylie does not think Facebook is completely innocent, as the social media giant first knew of the data gathering in 2015.","\"Why Facebook didn't, you know, make more enquiries when they started seeing that, you know, tens of millions of records were being pulled this way?

Throughout the last year, every time bad news has broken, executives have downplayed its significance. Look at its public statements last year about how many people had seen Russian-bought election ads — first it was 10 million, then it was 126 million.","Top execs dodged Congress when it was asking questions about Russian interference. They are selling their shares at a record clip.","The actions of Facebook execs now recall how execs at Nokia and Blackberry reacted after the iPhone emerged. Their revenues kept growing for a couple years -- and they dismissed the threats. By the time users started leaving in droves, it was too late.","There's no outside attacker bringing Facebook down. It's a circular firing squad that stems from the company's fundamental business model of collecting data from users, and using that data to sell targeted ads. For years, users went along with the bargain. But after almost a year of constant negative publicity, their patience may be waning.","Facebook did not initially respond to questions or a request for comment from CNBC.","The drumbeat","For more than a year now, Facebook has been deflecting stories about how its platform was used during the 2016 presidential election.","Some of this activity — like Facebook embedding workers with the Trump campaign to tell them how to advertise more effectively — was perfectly legal, and in line with normal business practices. A lot of these tactics would probably have drawn no scrutiny if Donald Trump hadn't surprised everybody by winning an election that all the polls showed him losing.","Other activity was against Facebook's policies, or outright illegal. Most notably, a U.S. grand jury recently indicted 13 Russian nationals for conducting a disinformation campaign on American soil intended to further political divisions in the country and sway the election toward Trump. Their tactics included using Facebook groups to organize divisive political protests and buying targeted ads.","CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has remained aloof throughout the whole sequence of events.","He addresses some of these issues on personal Facebook posts, but seldom talks to the press about them. Last year, he spent most of the year doing photo ops with people around America, but did not show up when Congress asked questions about how the Russians used Facebook to influence the 2016 election.","This year, he announced his annual personal challenge would be fixing Facebook — in other words, doing his job as the CEO of a publicly traded company worth more than $500 billion. In past years, he's taught himself Mandarin and hunted his own food.","The spin","Over the weekend, Facebook gave a case study in how the company reacts inappropriately to negative news.","On Friday night, Facebook made a surprise announcement that the company had suspended a political analytics research firm, Cambridge Analytica. The firm was funded by large Republican donor Robert Mercer, and Trump's campaign used it to target ads on Facebook.","In its Friday post, Facebook claimed it had discovered new evidence that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted data about Facebook users passed to it by a Russian-American researcher, who had collected it through a personality quiz that 270,000 Facebook users took. The data included information like the cities where users lived and what they had \"liked\" on Facebook.","It was against Facebook's terms of use for the researcher to pass the data along. Cambridge Analytica had told Facebook it had deleted the data back in 2015, but Facebook said it had received recent reports to the contrary, according to the blog post.","(Cambridge Analytica has countered the allegations, saying it was in compliance with Facebook's guidelines, and that no data collected through the app was used in the Trump campaign.)","But as is often the case in political scandal, the problem isn't so much the original action, but the cover-up. Or in this case, the spin.","It turns out that Facebook didn't just spontaneously decide to ban the political research firm. It was actually trying to get ahead of two bombshell reports, in the New York Times and The Observer (the Sunday edition of U.K. paper The Guardian). The publications detailed exactly how Cambridge Analytica had collected information about Facebook users in a bid to target them with political messages.","Facebook knew about these news stories for some time. It also appears that the company was trying to squelch the reports.","The Times report claimed that, in private conversations with the newspaper, Facebook \"downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control.\" The Guardian wrote that \"Facebook's external lawyers warned the Observer it was making 'false and defamatory' allegations, and reserved Facebook's legal position.\"","The stories went ahead anyway. Once they were published, Facebook executives immediately took to Twitter to defend the company, insisting that this was not a \"breach.\"","In tweets that were later deleted, Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos called the stories \"important and powerful,\" while insisting that it was \"incorrect to call it a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\" The deleted tweets are preserved below:","Another senior Facebook exec, Andrew Bosworth, echoed that claim, saying it was \"unequivocally not a data breach.\"","So far, more than 24 hours after the stories, Zuckerberg and his number-two, COO Sheryl Sandberg, have not responded.","Missing the point","The Facebook executives who responded are correct — there was no security breach. Users gave their information willingly. Moreover, Facebook has since put better security controls for apps in place, so users can more easily control what information apps are gathering and how they're using it.","But they're missing the point.","Facebook users are slowly learning that almost anybody can use Facebook to collect detailed information about them, and that — at least some of the time — Facebook cannot control where this information flows, or how it is used. Using Facebook is like writing your life story down on a piece of paper, then taping it to a lamppost.","Journalists and privacy advocates may roll their eyes at this \"revelation\" — they've been warning people about Facebook and privacy since its inception.","Users mostly ignored these warnings. They wanted to share photos, connect with old friends, play games, take quizzes and watch videos, and Facebook gave them a simple way to do it. More than 2 billion people around the world now use the 14-year-old service, and Facebook sold nearly $40 billion worth of ads last year.","But things are beginning to change. There's a growing sense that Facebook has become creepy instead of fun.","A lot of people are noticing that the ads on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram are so precisely targeted, they're sure the company is eavesdropping on their conversations through their phone microphones. (Facebook swears it is not — CNBC's Michelle Castillo has a great explanation of what is probably going on.)","More to the point, people are starting to curb their Facebook usage. In the fourth quarter, for the first time ever, the number of people in North America who used Facebook every day dropped from the previous year.","Also, Zuckerberg told investors on the company's earnings call that the company saw a 5 percent drop in time spent on Facebook during the quarter. The company claimed that this reduced engagement was because of some technical changes that Facebook made to crack down on low-quality content and give users a more positive experience.","These are just two small metrics. Facebook is still growing in many regions and by many other measurements.","But still: Fewer people using Facebook every day in one region, and spending less time on it. That's never happened before.","For the time being, advertisers are grumbling about Facebook and warning their clients to stay away from certain ad products, but they're still putting their money there — with an audience over 2 billion and some of the most accurate ad targeting available, Facebook is still impossible to ignore.","But if usage continues to decline, advertisers will start eventually follow. And there are plenty of hungry smaller competitors — Twitter and Snap, particularly — who would be happy to take some of that money.","Executive stock sales not reassuring","Meanwhile, Facebook executives are not exactly sending a reassuring message to investors by unloading their shares at a rapid clip.","Last summer, after Zuckerberg's plan to create another class of stock to solidify his control of the company foundered, he announced he'd begin selling off up to 75 million shares (about 18 percent of his stake), worth nearly $13 billion, by mid-2019. The money will support the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), his other company devoted to good works.","Why now? Zuckerberg is 33 years old -- far from retirement. What exactly is CZI doing that requires such a massive investment? Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is building rocket ships to explore space with his other company Blue Origin, and he only needs to spend $1 billion a year.","Other top executives are also selling in massive amounts. Jan Koum, who founded the messaging app WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014 for $19 billion, sold $2.8 billion worth of shares last year — more than any exec at any major tech company. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sold $2 billion of stock last year, in part to fund Blue Origin. Nobody else is close.)","Sandberg sold over $300 million, which pales in comparison to her colleagues but is still unusually large among officers of top tech companies.","Facebook stock is up over 80 percent in the last 12 months. Perhaps these execs are just taking gains, as any normal employee with stock compensation would be advised to do.","But these are not normal employees. They're the leaders of the company.","Other leaders keep skin in the game during difficult times -- think of how Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer held on to most of his stock throughout his tenure, even as Microsoft faced expensive antitrust lawsuits and growing competitive threats, or how Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey bought shares in 2017 when many investors had written the company off.","Facebook is facing real problems. Instead of giving answers to those problems, top execs are selling, spinning and staying silent."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand.","Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network.","He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them.","“Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it.","“Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.”","Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland.","(NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.)","The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges.","The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results).","And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value — and led to a bunch of lawsuits.","“We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on.","“Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.”","He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account.","So, er, ouch.","In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner himself as, er, hostile to privacy…","A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement:","We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further.","This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions.","Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!).","The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning.","Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook.","Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period.","Downloaded FB data also gives you insight into whom else has data on you (used to run custom audiences). Have never engaged with 75% of these… pic.twitter.com/dQPjIcI8CW","“I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.”","Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot.","But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users.","“They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.”","“Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large.","“It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?”","“They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks. If you think about how antitrust laws work, that’s the starting point for those laws. So it’s kind of mindboggling that they don’t see their argumentation, how it’s going to hurt them at some point.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

In the 937-word statement, posted on his Facebook profile Wednesday afternoon, Zuckerberg outlined all that Facebook has done and plans to do to keep our data safe.","But while he has addressed the news issue he hasn’t addressed the underlying problem. By the time Mark Zuckerberg made his amends it was already too late.","What has happened in the last five days has been the biggest crisis of Facebook’s existence. But Zuckerberg’s five-day silent treatment may prove more damning for Facebook than any of the news that precipitated it. This wouldn’t be nearly as extreme crisis for most companies. When bad things happen at other Fortune 500 companies, there is a script they follow—call it good crisis PR. The head of communications promises to look into an issue. A CEO makes a statement, well-reviewed by the legal team beforehand. If the crisis is really bad, someone resigns or gets fired. Once the perceived villain has been held accountable, everyone returns to normal unscathed. These corporate theatrics have come to embody the acceptable approach to business accountability.","But Facebook has always been a different kind of company—billing itself as a more intimate, personal service than, say, a car manufacturer (like Volkswagen) or an oil distributor (like BP). After all, what Facebook is selling is intimacy: a place to house your thoughts and opinions, and connect to friends and family. You can trust Facebook—you have to! You friends are here! And your number one friend, Mark Zuckerberg, is always at the ready to tell you what Facebook is doing and why.","But Facebook has always been a different kind of company—billing\nitself as an more intimate, personal service","Until the past year, this approach to building Facebook has been Zuckerberg’s chief asset. He intuited earlier than most that a decade after the internet’s introduction, people had begun to trust individuals over companies, and the best way to build a 21st century business was to build it in the guise of a person. As he told Bloomberg BusinessWeek last fall, “People trust people, not institutions.”","The service he built has only accelerated this shift. By its nature, Facebook elevates individuals while deprecating institutions. Individuals are the atoms, connecting to one another to spread information. Institutions get “pages,” which can be liked and shared—or ignored—by those people. Facebook’s role in society has been to transfer to individuals many of the activities, like recommending news articles, sourcing vacation destinations, and figuring out the best twin stroller for city dwellers, that used to reside with institutions.","But for Facebook to succeed in the midst of this shift in authority, Zuckerberg knew it needed a relatable individual to be a stand-in for the company—a recognizable, authentic voice who users felt they knew. That proxy would be Zuckerberg. So, as the service has grown from a place for college kids’ to poke each other to a global communications utility, he has repositioned himself into a pseudo-statesman. He has spoken at the United Nations General Assembly. He has started a hybrid philanthropy and investment outfit to put his billiions of dollars to work in service of solving intractable social problems. Last year he traveled to all fifty states, photographer in tow. All of this has been documented on his Facebook profile, along with photos in which he’s baking with his wife for the Jewish holidays or celebrating the Chinese New Year with his children. Inside Facebook, there are communications professionals dedicated to reviewing and ghostwriting his posts, and helping him craft and maintain this profile, which has more than 105 million followers. (For context, that’s just less than the total subscriber base of Netflix.)","Zuckerberg intuited that a decade after the internet’s\nintroduction, people had begun to trust individuals over\ncompanies","Early on, this strategy worked. Facebook’s users were, like Zuckerberg, American Ivy Leaguers interested in using his network for similar things—dating, posting drunk selfies, dating. Facebook’s problems were comparably narrow, and when the company clashed with users—usually by overstepping in the way it introduced new services, causing users to fear they were ceding too much control of personal information—Zuckerberg could speak to them directly. The first such letter I remember arrived in September 2006, just after Facebook launched the News Feed. “We really messed this one up,” it began. He explained himself, asked for patience, and suggested a fix. This approach became Zuckerberg’s playbook for addressing problems. It mostly worked. Facebookers forgave Zuckerberg, er, Facebook—or at least continued to use its service.","But over this past year, this approach has frayed. Increasingly, it has become obvious there are things our friend Zuckerberg isn’t telling us. In February, this magazine put a battered image of Zuckerberg on the cover, detailing the company’s desperate efforts to address news and information. Now comes the revelation that for several years, Facebook allowed third parties to access vast amounts of our personal information, and the company was both lax in monitoring how those groups used that data, and slow to address abuse when it was discovered. These facts reveal Facebook’s struggles over how to address the challenges that the openness it has always prized has wrought. They raise questions about the degree to which Facebook has acted and is acting in the best interest of its users, and suggest the possibility that Facebook has, at times, covered up information. And they force us all to ask: Can Mark Zuckerberg be trusted?","This is an existential question for the company. Because there’s one great challenge with empowering trust in people over institutions: People are fickle. They change. They disappoint. Sometimes, in moments of crisis, they ghost us. Individuals are easily taken down by a moment that shifts our perception of their character. Which leaves Facebook’s leader with an unenviable task: If Zuckerberg wants us to believe now that his company is not vulnerable, he must shore up trust in himself as an individual. It’s his only way forward.","For the past five days, government officials have summoned Zuckerberg to speak. Journalists have demanded to hear from him. His own employees have used Twitter and even Facebook to try to stand up for the company he started, but he’s been absent. He didn’t show up at the company’s own internal staff meeting on Tuesday afternoon. Finally, he has weighed in, with, of course, a Facebook post and the promise of a television interview. Less than a half hour later, the post had 3,100 comments. “So basically you knew this shit was going on years ago and NOW since you've been caught with your pants down, this is your response?” one commenter wrote, summarizing a particularly common response. “Pathetic. I really do hope Congress makes you testify.”","It will take more than charming posts showing Zuckerberg baking in his kitchen to appease the regulators who are now stepping up, and countless displays of intimacy to win back the trust of his users.","Trust in Zuckerberg","Facebook is inextricably linked to Mark Zuckerberg. That’s been his greatest advantage, but now could be his undoing.","Facebook doesn’t share much of its data with researchers and their lack of access limits their work and our knowledge of social networks."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Infrastructure engineers use a software version of this “chaos monkey” to test online services’ robustness—their ability to survive random failure and correct mistakes before they actually occur. Tech entrepreneurs are society’s chaos monkeys, disruptors testing and transforming every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and lodging (AirBnB) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder). One of Silicon Valley’s most audacious chaos monkeys is Antonio García Martínez.","After stints on Wall Street and as CEO of his own startup, García Martínez joined Facebook’s nascent advertising team, turning its users’ data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark “Zuck” Zuckerberg. Forced out in the wake of an internal product war over the future of the company’s monetization strategy, García Martínez eventually landed at rival Twitter. He also fathered two children with a woman he barely knew, committed lewd acts and brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg's desk), lived on a sailboat, raced sport cars on the 101, and enthusiastically pursued the life of an overpaid Silicon Valley wastrel.","Now, this gleeful contrarian unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing and reveals how it is invading our lives and shaping our future. Weighing in on everything from startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetization and digital “privacy,” García Martínez shares his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a humorous, subversive tour of the fascinatingly insular tech industry. Chaos Monkeys lays bare the hijinks, trade secrets, and power plays of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists, accidental tourists, and money cowboys who are revolutionizing our world. The question is, will we survive?...more","Tarun GogineniIt won't be anything he/she hasn't seen before.

I'd say go for it and let your kid get a head start on understanding the way the world works.","This story cuts right through the bullshit and the bromides to get you to see how obscene fortunes are accumulated off the back of other people's work and sheer dumb luck.","The stories entrepreneurs tell are usually scrubbed and white-washed tales of high-minded ideals and clarity of will triumphing over the evil corporate opponents. Chaos Monkeys is perhaps one of the only books that admits the simple fact that everything in Silicon Valley (and maybe everywhere else) is driven first and foremost by self-interest and greed.","It's a breath of fresh air in a world populated by people writing their own press releases.(less)","Community Reviews","…technology entrepreneurs are society’s chaos monkeys, pulling the plug on everything from taxi medallions (Uber) to traditional hotels (AirBnB) to dating (Tinder).

If you want to learn about what life is like in Silicon Valley, you would do well to let to someone who has done the deed and lived the life show you the way. Antonio Garcia Martinez is our Virgil through a dark landscape where every great fortune is founded on a great crime, where morality is not only violated, but where its very existence is not recognized, where millionaires are a dime a dozen and where any sort of social consciousness is kept nicely sedated, a place where greed is king, fast is worshipped to the exclusion of better, and death is always at the door.","Antonio Garcia Martinez - from Money.cnn.com","Martinez has the cred to offer the tour. Having toiled as a quant at that paragon of virtue, Goldman Sachs, he eventually found life on The Street less than fully rewarding. He says that quants at Goldman were","mostly failed scientists like me who had sold out to the man and suddenly found themselves, after making it through years of advanced relativity and quantum mechanics, with a golf-club-wielding gorilla called a trader peering over their shoulder asking them where their risk report was. We were quantitative enablers, offering the new and shiny blessings of modern computation to the old business of buying and selling… quants were the eunuchs at the orgy. The fluffers on the porn set of high finance. We were the ever-present British guy in every Hollywood World War II film: there to add a touch of class and exotic sophistication, but not really consequential to the plot (except perhaps to conveniently take some bad guy’s bullet.)","As someone with pretty high end analytical and programming skills, he saw (or says he saw, who knows?) the impending meltdown in the 2007 financial world, and opportunities in the new frontier out west, so traded The Street for The Valley, taking a chance on a job on the other coast.","The book follows Garcia’s chronological trail from startup to finish, from employee to entrepreneur, to buy-out target, to middle-manager at a monster Valley corporation to…well, you’ll see, if you read the book, or just Google the guy. It is a well-worn trail, but not for you or me, most likely. So a tour guide is definitely called for. And Martinez is nothing if not an informative and eager cicerone through what can be a very dark and sulphurous place. Of course, there is plenty of that brimstone stench emanating from the author, an indication of just how well he fit in.","anyone who claims the Valley is meritocratic is someone who has profited vastly from it via nonmeritocratic means like happenstance, membership in a privileged cohort, or some concealed act of skullduggery. Since fortune had never been on my side, and I had no privileged cohort to fall back on, skullduggery it would have to be.","It does not seem like it was out of character for AGM to engage in a bit of back-stabbing, double-dealing, and multiple instances of self-serving justification for his various dark deeds. When he talks about his income and net worth, for instance, which would be a pretty sweet take for most of us, yet regarding it as subsistence level, one might be forgiven for gleefully imagining Martinez in his thirty-seven-foot sailboat having a very unfriendly encounter with a pod of large, angry, breaching sperm whales.","He offers an entertaining, if sometimes off-putting, alarming, even rage-inducing account of his experiences, offering many a word to the wise, or at least the ambitious, on how deals are made, how organizations are structured, and how to interpret some of the observables you might see. He is incisive and funny, and has a wicked way with words. I have added a selection of quotes as part of the EXTRA STUFF bit at the bottom of the review. You will definitely see what I mean. And he demonstrates quite a gift for selecting absolutely fabulous quotes to introduce most chapters.","Martinez covers the highs and lows of the struggle to rise up in The Valley. This includes the ABCs of doing a startup, getting funding, how to divide your equity for the most efficient operation, handling media to get the most buzz for your launch, researching the people you will be dealing with, and, if things go well, negotiating with the bigger blobs that want to absorb your company. One revelation was that acquisition of startups by the big players is just a higher-ticket form of HR recruiting.","There are worse ways of monetizing sociopathy than startups. If you know any better ways, I’m listening.","For policy wonks, you will learn about the H-1B sort-of immigration program that brings thousand of foreign workers to American jobs in a form of high-end indentured servitude.","Martinez offers a peek inside the operations of Twitter and Facebook, which is either entertaining or depressing, depending. But every company has its own culture, and AGM has a keen eye for the differences, and an analyst’s talent for examining structure. His take on large corporations functioning like nation-states, to the point of exchanging what are essentially diplomats, adds definite texture to the notion of corporations as the trans-national entities they truly are. Worse, he points out not only how corporations are like religion, but how, in that, they are very like the cult-world of some communist nations.","There are a few things that made this less than an entirely effervescent read. First, while part of his story line was how he worked towards installing a particular form of ad-revenue generation at FB, the details tended to get in the way of the overall picture. Office politics are nothing new, even in this bubbly narrative. Second, while AGM is obviously an uber-bright guy, with a keen mind for some things, and a talent for writing, he comes across as (and probably is) someone with the soul of a slave-trader. If you can hold your nose at his unnecessary tales of sexual adventure, his willingness to endanger the lives of regular folks with childish antics, and his casual acquaintance with ethical standards, there is much to be gleaned in Chaos Monkeys. It is a look at the sausage factory, a peep-show of how a bill becomes a law software grows from an idea to a tool, a walk through The Valley and its shadows. Slap on a gas mask to block the stench and take in the sights. You may not care for the aroma, but I guarantee that in terms of gaining insight into one of the major economic engines of the planet, this book is smokin’.","-----196 - humans, even at the rarified heights of the economic elite, are in truth scared, needy children playing at dress-up and pretending to be grown-ups","-----324 - Here’s what people don’t understand about advertising. Facebook is simply a routing system, almost like an old-time telephone exchange, that delivers a message for money. The address on that message can be approximate (e.g. males aged thirty five in Ohio), or it can be specific (e.g., the person who just shopped for a specific pair of shoes on Zappos). But either way, Facebook didn’t make the match of user and messenger, and at most decides secondary things like how often the ad is seen in general, or which of two ads addressed to you is seen that particular instant. In this sense, ads on Facebook are no different from phone calls or emails.","-----355 - At their extremes, capitalism and communism become equivalent: Endless toil motivated by lapidary ideals handed down by a revered and unquestioned leader, and put into practice by a leadership caste selected for its adherence to aforementioned principles, and richly rewarded for its willingness to grind whatever human grist the mill required? Same in both A (mostly) pliant media that flatters the existing system of production, framing it as the only such system possible? Check! Foot soldiers who sacrifice their families and personal lives for the efficient running of the system, and who view their sole human value through the prism of advancement within that system? Welcome to the People’s Republic of Facebook. But one can simply quit a job in capitalism, while from communism there is no escape, you’ll protest. As for the actual ability to opt out under capitalism: look at Seattle or SF real estate prices, and the cost of a decent US education, and consider whether Amazon or Facebook employees could really opt out of their treadmill I’ve never known one who did, and I’ve known many. Ask your average family providers, even those in a two-income family, whether they felt they could simply quit when they liked. They could barely get a few weeks off when they had a child, much less opt out. Switching jobs would amount to nothing more than changing the color of the shackles.... The reality is that capitalism, communism and every other sweeping ideology feed off the same human drives—the founder’s or revolutionary’s narcissistic will to power, and the mass man’s desire to be part of something bigger than himself—even if with very different outcomes...yoking together the monomaniac’s twitchy urge and the follower’s hunger for a role in some captivating story.","-----359 – What was intriguing was how the unwealthy embraced the system, even if they weren’t the beneficiaries of this new social order we’d all joined. The junior hire was sucked along by enthusiasm and cluelessness, but the more senior employees at the middle-manager level knew the score. They knew that they lived one lifestyle, but their old-timer supervisor, who wasn’t necessarily more talented, lived very much another.","This was a textbook case of the Marxist argument that capitalists instill the values of the property owners into their managerial classes, while still keeping most of the fruits of labor, in order to make common cause against the exploited proletariat, even though manager and worker have more in common than either does with the senior leadership.","The title is a little misleading.

So this ‘insider’ exposé, from a man who had worked his way up the ladder from launching his own start-up company to holding a prominent role at Facebook, seemed like the ideal place to commence my education.","Antonio Garcia Martinez quit his PhD studies in Physics to earn some lucre working for Goldman Sachs. His job was to model prices for credit derivatives (he explained this but I’d have to say it flew way over my head). After becoming disillusioned with banking he used his skill set to set up a new technology company in the field of advertising and after it’s sale to Twitter he took up a role within the Facebook hierarchy. By this stage he’d developed some expertise in linking data streams (e.g. Facebook’s own knowledge of it’s members and their personal internet browsing history) with which he hoped to leverage monetisation of the business through the improved ability to supply a more focused advertising approach. Well, that’s my own interpretation/understanding of what he was trying to achieve – in truth, one downside of this book is that there is a lot of technical language here with dozens of acronyms thrown in for good measure and consequently I’m sure his own one-liner on this would be much more colourful.","Aside from this, there is a good deal of interesting insight here. For instance, how new technology businesses are typically funded and how the entrepreneurs are ultimately rewarded for their efforts is explained in some detail. Also, the way in which online advertising has become increasingly targeted to individuals is brought to life. This is good stuff and it’s interspersed with the account of the author’s own life and experiences, though there’s not a lot on Martinez’s life outside of work simply because there wasn’t much life outside of his work. It’s clear that if you’re going to be a success in Silicon Valley then work is your life! There are some humorous moments too, but in truth these are few and far between.","Possibly the most interesting section for me was where he lifted the lid on the culture inside of Facebook. For instance, I didn’t know that meals were (and maybe still are) provided free to all workers - either as purely benevolent act on the part of the company or possibly to remove a reason for workers to head home or outside of the workplace for their next refuelling stop. And in the eager push to land new projects mantras such as ‘done is better than good’ and ‘perfect is the enemy of good’ were thrown about with abandon.","Overall I enjoyed my time with this book.

At nearly every unfortunate instance he turned the book away from SV and towards his own loathsome self, I rolled my eyes to heaven and reminded myself why, fundamentally speaking, I have never pursued a similar career: no amount of millions in vested stock options could compensate for the torture that would be working alongside egos like Antonio García Martínez.","In his smug, off-hand manner, he manages to disparage women (who are consistently given the Trump treatment), people of color (one maligned Indian man is likened to a bored Delhi rickshaw driver; the unsavory flavor of San Jose neighborhood's dangerous character is evoked by mentioning that its two public high schools are named after venerated persons of color), and anyone with any minimal sense of decency (he takes care to distance himself from his own children, whom he treats as mere distractions, and this fact is a recurring \"joke.\") His assumed reader is a frat boy like himself (this is made explicit every time he annoyingly addresses \"you, dear reader\" directly), and, between his descriptions of women as if they were nothing more than the spoils of successful entrepreneurship, he attacks Silicon Valley's system of values (purely a case of sour grapes, in his case) and, within the same pages, mentions that even uttering the word \"privilege\" makes him want to throw up.","Every time this man feels under-compensated for his shining brilliance (≈$1 million a year is \"barely cutting middle class in San Francisco!), he takes a moment to harangue us on the evils of capitalism, how it robs us of meaning, etc. This from the man who prides himself effusively, page after page, on the genius of his advertising strategies and the tragedy of his visionary ideas not being taken seriously enough by the evil, evil Facebook capitalists who employ him.","He refers to the cofounders of his startup almost exclusively as \"the boys,\" to hammer home just how superior he finds himself to them, and everyone else, in comparison. No opportunity to take credit for a clever idea is lost on this man, nor is any opportunity to exculpate himself from a bad one. There is an entire chapter dedicated to his borrowing a Tesla and racing down a hill with zero regard to the fact that it would have resulted in a severe head-on collision had another car been working its way up (this disregard for the safety of anyone else is touted as a character trait of successful visionaries like himself; I'm reminded of a quote from Miranda July's novel: \"He drove like he lived, with entitlement.\").","I can't say enough bad things about this person. I suspect he masturbates to visions of this masterpiece being adapted for the big screen, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as himself. What an unpleasant, narcissistic tool. He brags about the cuh-razy drunken nights in the Mission with his \"friends\" and his in-office beer-brewing operation (\"I'm such a radical dude!!\"), meanwhile claiming to have been too busy reading Michel Houllebecq (e.g.) to have known who Lady Gaga or Alicia Keys is. /rolls eyes.","I give this two stars because, at the very least, this book is informative in its technodrivel (you will learn more about the farce that is social media monetization than you'll know what to do with) and in the grim picture it paints of the SV milieu in general: this is a culture where people like Martínez are given the reigns in the building of our technological infrastructure.

For the rest of us, the story of the excruciatingly hard work and intense drama that go into both a startup company and the internal machinations of an established, aggressive hi-tech company provide plenty of drama.","Garcia Martinez is obviously widely read. His well chosen chapter heading quotes and references to disparate sources make that clear. His writing is articulate, fast paced, intense and focused. The fact that he names names and gives an insider perspective to well known events makes the story an especially interesting one.","Having been sucked in, ground up and spit out of the Silicon Valley madness, Garcia Martinez is talking about taking off on a circumnavigation aboard his sailboat. One cannot help but wonder if he can make the change from the pressure and fast pace of his old existence to the new. I hope so....more","Not able to finish. After reading about half the book, I decided it was not worth my time. The author's jargon and general writing style were annoying, but it was how he wrote about women, as non-existent except as sex objects in this technological business world that made me just close the book. (less)","I found it pretty boring. This isn't how Silicon Valley is. This is a glimpse inside the life of a tech bro. The author wasn't very likable, and my opinion was confirmed late in the book when he admitted that he had a lifted truck AND a Mustang GT. I'd give this a pass.","Entertaining, in that he talks a lot of shit about FB execs, Twitter execs, and anyone he's worked with. But the bulk of the book is about his time as an ads product manager at FB, championing some ads thing, and it turns out I really really don't care","Liar’s Poker—remember that book? I wonder how it was received in 1989. It’s now considered a classic and is gleefully passed around summer training classes.

I’ve spent many a night gazing into this galaxy, exploring some celestial objects that are little more than dimly lit orbs of gaseous matter.","In Liar’s Poker, which is one of about four Wall Street bLiar’s Poker—remember that book? I wonder how it was received in 1989. It’s now considered a classic and is gleefully passed around summer training classes. It’s the North Star in a constellation of Wall Street memoirs spanning from Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (1923) to Straight to Hell (2015). I’ve spent many a night gazing into this galaxy, exploring some celestial objects that are little more than dimly lit orbs of gaseous matter.","In Liar’s Poker, which is one of about four Wall Street books that anyone should ever consider reading twice, Michael Lewis (who is now a respected American novelist) details his experience during the glory days of Salomon Brothers, an investment bank that specialized in bond trading. Lewis wrote astutely of everything from his days in training class (which is probably why new recruits find the book so charming) to the big swinging d****s (high performers) who roamed the trading floor, to the game that is the book’s namesake.","Through all of this, Lewis was on the sidelines. In fact, he might have only been in New York for summer training and spent the rest of his time in London. He had no importance to the story—and an endearing criticism of the book is that he was just a snarky little twentysomething who ended up writing what was, to 1980s Wall Street, received as if it were tabloid journalism.","Many have tried and failed to capture the magic of the company exposé like Michael Lewis did. Dan Lyons wrote Disrupted, which was about his time at Hubspot, in a similar vein, but it was nothing compared to Liar’s Poker. As soon as it becomes obvious that someone is sticking around just for the story, some of the magic is lost. So one must walk a fine line when writing a Liar’s Poker.","Antonio Martinez goes overboard on a few occasions, but he’s come closer than anyone else to writing the Liar’s Poker of Silicon Valley. And this is not an easy thing to do. Michael Lewis himself attempted to write the Liar’s Poker of Silicon Valley. It was called The New New Thing and was published in 1999. It’s now embarrassingly dated and has been relegated to the lowest quartile of Lewis’ published works ranking. There is a parallel between the excesses of 1980s Wall Street and late 90’s Silicon Valley, but the book was forgettable. It didn’t read the same way that Liar’s Poker did.","Michael Lewis failed to write the Liar’s Poker of Silicon Valley. Why did we have to wait seventeen years for a quant to come along and commit career suicide with the goal of delivering it?","First and foremost, Antonio Martinez knows what he’s talking about. He’s exceptionally well-read, smart, ambitious, and has high emotional intelligence. One of my favorite thing to do is bust phonies like Tai Lopez who claim to be voracious readers and aren’t. Faced with mountains of well-selected quotes, tight editing, and advanced vocabulary, I believe Antonio when he says he spent his childhood in the library. He convinced me to read Meditations with one great quote selection. This gives him significant credibility as a narrator, and affords him some room to make derisive statements, such as calling Nassim Taleb a pseudo-intellectual.","Antonio knows what he’s talking about because he followed the noble path of starting as an engineer before transitioning to project management. During these years, he was at the forefront of advancements in the ad space. He knew the business so well and was able to seamlessly describe what was going on. Unlike Wall Street, which always is accompanied by a murky foreboding, the implications of digital ad technology are both very real and very easy to understand. He did a wonderful job explaining his industry, his role in the industry, and the valley as a whole.","So, why isn’t this book considered a modern classic?","We’ll start with a softball. Character development is poor compared to a Lewis book. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg: we know them. A few others: geeks like me know them. The other actors are hard to connect with because Antonio’s narration style is overwhelming. Saying he’s an egoist might be a stretch, but he remained the center of attention throughout. Also, the monikers ‘British Trader’ and ‘Israeli Psychologist’ were ill-conceived. To me, those are two of the worst countries to use as descriptors because there’s no consistency in the mental images readers will generate. The only character I really remember is the CMU football player, but only because the guy who sits next to me at work also played there, also studied engineering there, and shares some facial features.","When it comes to storytelling, Antonio is talented, but he and Michael Lewis apply their wit differently. On one hand, it’s a wildly fun read. On the other hand, it sacrifices the potential for cultural longevity to appeal to what people like me want to read right now. Will people be reading Tucker Max in ten years? Shenanigans are funny, but unless you’re a master of the craft, it’s hard to phrase these things timelessly (not to suggest Antonio was trying to be timeless, or that timelessness is even a goal worth pursuing when writing a memoir). To that point, the DUI incident and reckless driving were kind of dumb.","Generally, the way Antonio discusses his relationships women will be perceived as politically incorrect. I don’t care. But the flippancy of it all irked me. His relationship with British Trader leading to the birth of their first child fit into the story well, but after that it became haphazard. The reader is left without any real comprehension of the nature of Antonio’s relationships with women or his children. And if all of this irked me, there is no doubt that it’s the main reason the book has been rebuked within certain circles. Antonio never could have predicted popular opinion moving so harshly against the alpha male, but more prudence would have gone a long way here.","Liar’s Poker was meant to serve as a warning; it’s remembered for being an arousal. Chaos Monkeys was intended to be an electrifying, divisive, no-holds-barred memoir. It will be remembered as an electrifying, divisive, no-holds-barred memoir.","I was disappointed in this book.

If this was a sincere confessional, that would be one thing. But he excuses his behavior by \"this is what you need to do to make it in this cutthroat environment\". In this he is wrong. I worked for a startup software company in Ohio that lasted for twenty years without these shenanigans (admittedly that I know of), so I don't buy that any of the events in this book were necessary.There are some reasons to read this book.

His takedown of Silicon Valley’s culture in general and Facebook’s in particular is withering, but writing it all off to spite is grossly unfair. Chaos Monkeys reveals the ins and outs of venture capital, the vicissitudes of launching a tech company, the intricacies of compensation in Silicon Valley, the divide between the Valley’s “haves” (early hires) and “have-nots” (most of the rest), and the internecine warfare among the behemoths of the technology world (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft). And Martinez writes about it all in a take-no-prisoners style that is at once profane, colorful, and incisive. Though it’s all viewed through the eyes of one unhappy veteran of the Valley, Chaos Monkeys is nonetheless an important book. The author is clearly brilliant, uncannily articulate, and an unusually sharp observer. Discount the seething anger that seeps between the lines, and you’ll emerge from reading this book with a much clearer picture of what life in Silicon Valley is like.","A lucid insider’s account","Chaos Monkeys is a lucid insider’s account of three years of life and work in the belly of the Silicon Valley beast. Martinez shreds the reputations of many of those he worked with, not just at Facebook but (previously) at Goldman Sachs and (later) at two other San Francisco tech companies. With only a couple of exceptions, no one comes across as worse than Martinez himself. Chaos Monkeys, as much confessional as expose, is imbued throughout with the author’s cynicism. However, he urges us not to “be deceived by my withering criticism of Facebook in this book; inside every cynic lives a heartbroken idealist. If I’m now a mordant critic, it’s because at one point, like Lucifer once being the proudest angel before the fall, I too lived and breathed for Facebook, perhaps even more than most.” Martinez is as disdainful of his own behavior as he is of others.","A warped perception of life in America","Unfortunately, the author ingenuously reveals his own warped values. Explaining that after four years at Facebook (he was only there for two), his compensation would have amounted to nearly $1 million per year. Then he complains that “it was really about $550,000 take-home per year, or about twelve times the median US family income . . . This was about San Francisco middle class, or barely, really.” (Really??!!) “Coupled with another tech salary from a spouse, it would be the high-six-figure take-home that would permit a normal, though not posh, life in what was becoming the country’s priciest city.” One million dollars per year?? Middle class?? Give me a break!","About the author","Antonio Garcia Martinez left a highly paid job as a “quant” at Goldman Sachs for a two-year stint at a firm developing software and services for online advertisers. Then, with two coworkers, he left to co-found a startup in the same field. In just one year, the three sold their business to Twitter — but Martinez managed to escape the deal and take a lucrative middle-management job at Facebook. His two years there forms the bulk of Chaos Monkeys....more","If Antonio Martinez never writes another book, he will still go down as the author who best captured the Zeitgeist in the hottest (dare I say central?) industry of our times.","Much like Michael Lewis’ debut a short 26 years ago, this is the story of a young graduate who lands a seat at the high table without having formally been invited, makes the most of it, keeps his sanity and lives to tell.","So you follow him from the Vampire Squid to Adchemy, you cheer for him when he persuades two engineers tIf Antonio Martinez never writes another book, he will still go down as the author who best captured the Zeitgeist in the hottest (dare I say central?) industry of our times.","Much like Michael Lewis’ debut a short 26 years ago, this is the story of a young graduate who lands a seat at the high table without having formally been invited, makes the most of it, keeps his sanity and lives to tell.","So you follow him from the Vampire Squid to Adchemy, you cheer for him when he persuades two engineers to leave and help him set up AdGrok, you do the math alongside him when he’s selling to Twitter and Facebook at the same time, you pitch FBX (Facebook Exchange) with him to Sheryl… I guess I’ve spoilt it enough, let’s leave it there.","You may cringe at language that would make Matt Taibbi blush, but the profanity is always a propos and would certainly never be out of place at the series of workplaces where this drama unfolds.

He stumbled onto several lucky opportunities, getting into Y combinator and working with \"the boys\", engineers who based on his description, are more talented than he is. He torpedos basically every personal and business relationship he has due to a problem with authority and his inflated self-regard. He somewhat screwed over the other cofounders of the company he started for so that he could work for Facebook instead of Twitter. This decision was made because (1) someone at Facebook took a laptop to the bathroom and (2) one Twitter interviewer mentioned work-life balance as a positive aspect of the company. He then went on annoy many important people at Facebook, and got fired. \"The boys\" and other people he meets along the way generally ended up doing pretty well, despite the author's disdain for everyone who isn't himself.","There is a deep thread of misogyny and narcissism that runs through the book.

{"originalurl":"http://muslimmirror.com/eng/corrective-measures-required-post-facebook-data-breach/","title":"The corrective measures required post-Facebook data breach - Muslim Mirror","text":["The corrective measures required post-Facebook data breach","The Facebook data breach raises urgent questions that need to be answered responsibly by our industry — given its terrifying scale and impact. In today’s world, data is a form of soft power, and it is essential for those who wield it, to use it responsibly so that consumer confidence isn’t compromised.","The challenge is that, at an idea-generation stage, it can be difficult to draw a clear, bright line between whether data is being used for optimisation or for manipulation.","Take, for instance, the Obama and Trump campaigns in the US. The former used the same digital platforms for optimising communication and ensuring voter confidence and dissemination of information. On the other hand, British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used the same platforms but with malafide intent — to manipulate the views and preferences of voters.","Advertisement","As investigations continue, it is increasingly clear that data was stolen, models used were unauthorised for the purpose they were being used, the messages (in many cases) were outright lies.","So the whole operation was questionable from the get-go. It is, therefore, extremely critical to demarcate this difference — are the final consumers of a data-driven model being actively manipulated or is data being used to merely optimise a communications strategy?","It is also essential to clearly define the parties involved in the data “lifecycle” and their roles and responsibilities, with regard to how data is being used. There are usually three parties in this lifecycle, each requiring a different kind of oversight and norms.","First are the data originators, those that capture and store the data. And I’m not only talking about Facebook and Google, but also a wide range of other originators — for e.g. Equifax (which holds extremely sensitive consumer credit information), banks (which store individual-centric financial information), telecom organisations (which hold a treasure trove of communications and browsing information), etc.","Two safeguards are critical here.","One, data security safeguards to ensure the privacy (external parties shouldn’t be able to see it) and integrity (external parties shouldn’t be able to change it) of the data. This can be improved by ring-fencing the data sources and ensuring advanced security measures.","And two, ensuring explicit consumer consent for sharing and using this data. This can be done by introducing easy-to-understand verbiage around fair-use — where their data could be used and for what purposes.","These two interventions — data security and informing users where data could be shared — are the key and will go a long way in winning back consumer trust in these platforms.","The second type of entity involved is the data processing companies which employ intelligent algorithms over the data to extract insights. This includes companies like Cambridge Analytica.","Given that data processing companies also have access to a large scale of data, entrusted by clients, it is imperative that their systems are subject to similar levels of security, compliance and governance norms.","This can be resolved through globally-agreed standards of security, enforced through regular third-party audits. We need to be held to the same standards as the data sources themselves when it comes to security of the data so that we aren’t the weak link in the event of a data leak.","There may also be value in exploring how we can expressly declare the nature of algorithms employed and the source of these algorithms (in cases where there is a patent to one), to an unaffiliated third-party regulator. This will ensure better transparency around what the data is being used for.","Finally, we have the third party in the data lifecycle: The buyers of the data — organisations that pay for the data and algorithm-driven insights around it. In this case, they are the political organisations that are beneficiaries of the analysis work by the processing companies.","Here, let’s go back to my earlier point of drawing the line between what is optimisation and manipulation.","Are the data buying organisations sponsoring an ad because they feel consumers genuinely stand to benefit from the content, or are they using the data to manipulate users into actions that are not in their best interest?","More importantly, does the ad-sponsoring organisation have the authority to display that ad, or are they a geo-political adversary? This can be cleared up by implementing fair-usage policies around what the extracted data is being used for, who is using it, and what are the implications of that data — all of which needs to be made more transparent and subject to governance norms in certain cases.","Obviously, the three parties interplay with each other. For instance, Facebook and Google are two of these parties — the source and the processor. Thus, it needs to be ensured that they be accountable to both sets of norms.","It is imperative that all parties in the data lifecycle take seriously the trust with which data is being shared with them by their users — for their own good. The way things stand right now, biting around the edges of this debate is not going to win back lost consumer confidence in our industry and we are all the losers in the long term.","(Sameer Dhanrajani is Chief Strategy Officer at analytics service provider Fractal Analytics.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board.","The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","Tony Romm contributed to this report.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The pressure may also foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network.","A top UK lawmaker on Monday backed sweeping new powers for the nation’s privacy watchdog.","“The time has now come for us to look at giving more powers to the information commission in the UK,” Damian Collins, a Conservative and chair of the UK Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee, told LBC radio in an interview on Monday.","Facebook on Friday said that a professor used Facebook’s log-in tools to get people to sign up for what he claimed was a personality-analysis app he had designed for academic purposes.","To take the quiz, 270 000 people gave the app permission to access data via Facebook on themselves and their friends, exposing a network of 50 million people, according to the New York Times.","That kind of access was allowed per Facebook’s rules at the time. Afterward, the professor violated Facebook’s terms when he passed along that data to Cambridge Analytica.","Shares in Facebook fell as much as 4.2% during pre-market trading in New York.","Facebook found out about the breach in 2015, shut down the professor’s access and asked Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted the user data.","Yet the social network on Friday suspended Cambridge from its system, explaining that it had learned the information wasn’t erased.","Cambridge, originally funded by conservative political donor Robert Mercer, on Saturday denied that it still had access to the user data, and said it was working with Facebook on a solution.","A researcher who worked with the professor on the app is now currently an employee at Facebook, which is reviewing whether he knew about the data leak.","Criticism","The denials and refutations did little to ease the criticism. Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Sunday that Zuckerberg or another senior executive should appear in front of his committee because previous witnesses have avoided difficult questions, creating “a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.’’","He added in an interview on British radio Monday that Zuckerberg should \"stop hiding behind his Facebook page and actually come out and answer questions about his company.”","The next few weeks represent a critical time for Facebook to reassure users and regulators about its content standards and platform security, to prevent rules that could impact its main advertising business, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.","“Changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote in a note to investors.","Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to explain that the mishandling of user data was out of its hands and doesn’t constitute a “breach” – a definition that would require the company to alert users about whether their information was taken, per US Federal Trade Commission rules.","Menlo Park, California-based Facebook no longer allows app developers to ask for access to data on users’ friends. But the improper handling of the data raises systemic questions about how much companies can be trusted to protect personal information, said Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology.","“While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways,” O’Connor said in a statement.","“Communications technologies have become an essential part of our daily lives, but if we are unable to have control of our data, these technologies control us.

It was seen as a natural way to evolve society into the future. College humanities and liberal arts departments, usually located in close proximity in campus administration buildings were petri dishes for all the newly entertained ideas of the social progressives.","Coming off recent wins for the progressive Left in Title IX cases in the Supreme Court in the 1990’s and the institutional opportunists in power during the Obama administration, the scope and potential for top down authoritarian Leftist policies to continue into the 21st century and beyond seemed limitless.","The Left grew braver and braver by the day as new and more bold social engineering models were proposed and implemented both in school policy and in federal, state and local government. Coming off Obama’s 1st term, the Conservatives had almost become rendered mute by the noise of the progressive Left.","Any challenge to, question of or even thought to reconsider any of the toxic new social rules of the Left was preempted by the contempt they had for conservatives. Allegiance to authority was expected and acquiescence to expertise was demanded. They knew better and they were to be deferred to without accountability.","American’s relinquishment of rights and personal freedoms started in earnest at the start of this 21st century, following the consolidation and centralization of power by the federal government after 9/11 as it turned its back on the wisdom of The Federalist Papers. The TSA was established with the authority to physically contact another without consent.","School shootings escalated into the subsequent two decades as lone, disaffected students, alienated by the post – modernist attacks on civics and the knowledge of the Enlightenment by teachers who did not endure this themselves, took it on themselves to retaliate in the only way they knew – against the institution itself.","The toxic atmosphere in school, particularly in schools in lower income areas and to those children who are not cared for enough due to their parents distracted by work, and other time commitments, became exacerbated by the further commitments imposed by feminist and transgender theory and the desecration of American and Christian history in the classroom.","Conservatives are, by nature, individualist. They are not so dependent on strong social contacts or the validity or affirmation of strong social circles. Thus, typically, we have not had the inclination or the means to communicate with each other about our values as a group as proficient as the Left have.","It looked like the Conservatives and Republicans were a dying breed. Destined to fade away by the encroachment of the progressives. Many of us were not able to identify other conservatives as a way to defend our values, mitigate our losses or form an offensive strategy in the face of the relentlessness of the Left.","Even where we could, our ability to think rationally, logically and with reason was itself erased by the new rules of the Left where identity politics weaponized social engineering and distilled all coherent arguments, both in and out of the classroom, down to race, gender, white privilege.","Yet, at the moment in time the new rules were to take effect, a new form of media came into our purview. Since the advent of the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube whose widespread popular adoption occurred simultaneously since 2007, Conservatives finally had a medium to use to not only identify, connect to and communicate with fellow Conservatives but to use as a means to group, organize and fight back and crucially to enable us to articulate the correct response to our Leftist foes and to formulate and propagate new ideas.","It was not known at the time, but social media could only be good for Conservatives and it is only good for Conservatives alone. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube realize this now. That is why they are doing all they can to silence, suppress and stigmatize Conservative accounts online. See, they thought they’d won. They thought their worldview was predominant and infallible. They thought Conservatives were in defeat. They were wrong."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

I heard it most recently on last week's Slate \"Political Gabfest\" podcast, where the cohost David Plotz brought it up in relation to the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal.","It struck me as an especially important phrase to remember in the era of \"free\" internet services. It's easy to use services from the likes of Google and Facebook and Twitter every day, never thinking of what you're trading for those services. In the case of Facebook, it's your personal information.","Just one of the many pages in Facebook's settings showing you how your data is used to make Facebook money. Facebook/Instagram/Business Insider","In case you weren't already acutely aware, the information gathered about you by Facebook — your interests, your age, your location, your gender, etc. — is used to sell advertisements. Rather than you paying Facebook to use its social network, Facebook makes its money by selling ads.","That's how it stays \"free\" to you and me: Facebook uses the demographic information of its over 2 billion users to sell targeted advertisements.","These targeted ads can be relatively benign, like an advertisement for \"Super Mario Odyssey\" being served to someone who liked the Nintendo page on Facebook. But that user information can also be used in ways that Facebook users may not like — such as the case with Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that used the information of over 50 million Facebook users to help the Trump campaign target voters.","Facebook says it discovered roughly $100,000 in ad buys from June 2015 to May 2017, representing approximately 3,000 ads connected to nearly 500 affiliated fake accounts. The ads were intended to sow discord, divide US citizens, and galvanize political extremes leading up to the November 2016 election.","It may be more shocking if it weren't so logical.","Facebook — and other \"free\" service companies — are in the business of using user data to make money. They aren't regulated like public utilities, and they aren't necessarily in the business of protecting your best interests. Do your interests line up with their financial goals? That is the question.","It's a good question to keep in mind when considering your use of services like Facebook and Twitter in the modern era.

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","News reports now suggest that contrary to prior representations, Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Jared Kushner to run Trump’s data operation, had contacts with Russians, specifically a Russian energy firm. (“Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed ‘micro-targeting’ individuals on social media during elections.”)","Cambridge Analytica was also the subject of a Wall Street Journal report, which found that “the chief executive of a data-analytics firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing, according to a person familiar with the effort. The outreach by the CEO of the firm, which is partly owned by a major Trump donor and has close ties to a Trump adviser, came as Mr. Trump was publicly cheering the leaks of his Democratic rival’s emails and some supporters were seeking to unearth further messages.” And one more nugget: None other than Michael Flynn had an “advisory role” with a firm linked to Cambridge Analytica.","Maybe this is all coincidence. Perhaps Cambridge Analytica has no role whatsoever in providing guidance or data to Russians seeking to manipulate the U.S. election. Perhaps Facebook was an entirely innocent player, hoodwinked by Cambridge Analytica (which was recently suspended from the platform), and had no idea that all this data was being sourced to aid in foreign manipulation of our election. However, at this point, Congress and the American people have considerable reason to doubt those conclusions.","Congress needs to get executives from Facebook (Zuckerberg himself) and Cambridge Analytica up to the Hill promptly to get answers from both firms. The public needs to know:","What was the extent of contacts between Cambridge Analytica and Russian officials?","Did Cambridge Analytica help guide the Russian social media operation by, for example, targeting specific users?","What information did Kushner have, if any, about Cambridge Analytica’s operation and its use of Facebook data?","What did Facebook know about Cambridge Analytica’s operation, when did it know it, and has it been candid and forthcoming in its disclosures?","Answers to these questions are critical not only to the Russia investigation but also to the future of social media platforms. The stakes are obviously high for Facebook, especially if it (intentionally or not) provided more of a boost to Trump’s victory than previously acknowledged. As intelligence analyst Malcolm Nance put it, “What happens if 100s of millions of progressives worldwide abandon Facebook because they think it’s a tool of Trump, Russia authoritarians and neo-Nazis? Facebook needs to own up and do damage control to ensure they are not 2018’s information cruise missile of choice.” Even if it never intended to bolster Trump, it’s hard to disagree that it was lax in recognizing manipulation of its platform and in disclosing the extent of the misuse of users’ data. “What’s clear is that Facebook has built up a massive intelligence tool that can be exploited by foreign actors who don’t care at all if they are violating Facebook’s user agreements,” remarks Max Bergmann, who heads the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress. “This incident demonstrates that it is time for Washington to get serious about regulating the tech companies. They’ve been living in a libertarian fantasy world of ‘don’t be evil’ but that doesn’t work when you have a fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders to prioritize profits.”","Facebook’s conduct during and after the 2016 election may well lead to federal regulation of social media of the type Klobuchar, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) are sponsoring, which would require archiving of political ads with detailed information regarding “a description of the audience the advertisement targets, the number of views generated, the dates and times of publication, the rates charged, and the contact information of the purchaser” and also subject online ads to the same campaign regulations that govern TV and radio ads.","At this point, it is increasingly hard to argue against such regulation, given the cavalier conduct of Facebook and the obvious opportunities for abuse by malicious foreign governments.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

That includes every like, message, event response, and any other mundane action on Facebook that could be used to profile a person.","The idea is to make it more useful for people to take control of their information, allowing them to see what Facebook has collected — and to wipe the slate clean, if they so choose.","A SINGLE SCREEN FOR SETTINGS","Settings can be a tricky and less-than-intuitive place for users to navigate. Facebook's mobile settings were previously spread across nearly 20 screens, but will now be condensed into one.","Users will be able to jump right into their personal information or change their password in the security section, among other actions, instead of going through layers to find the one setting they really need.","Courtesty Facebook","PRIVACY SHORTCUTS","This is Facebook's one-stop shop for finding more information about privacy, security and ads. Privacy shortcuts have been around for a few years (you may recall the cartoon dinosaur mascot Facebook attached to them).","The Privacy Shortcuts menu is also getting a simplified makeover to make the experience more visual and easier to navigate.","This is the menu where users can manage their audiences for various posts and review friend requests they've sent, posts they've reacted to, and other actions, all with just a few taps. Don't like something? Facebook will let users delete it here.","The revised menu also provides some practical security options, enabling users to turn on two-factor authentication, which requires them to enter a code sent to their phone when they log in from a new device, creating an extra layer of security.","Facebook says the new tools are just the start. In the coming weeks, they're planning other measures to be more transparent, including an updated policy about the data they collect and how it is used, along with proposed updates to Facebook's terms of service that underscore the social network's commitments to its users."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.","The plan centers on third-party brokers like Acxiom Corp. and Epsilon Data Management LLC, both of which collect information to package and sell — sometimes to other brokers, other times to marketers who intend to use the insights on platforms like Facebook’s.","Data brokers have been around a while, each collecting information that dates back before the internet was commonly used in most US households.

Today they know your sexual preferences, what you watch on TV, who your closest friends and family members are, and even whether you prefer a coupe or a sedan. It’s fair to say the internet has upped the ante.","Major players often purchased this bundled data, using that to help segment specific audiences to advertise to on social networks — in this case Facebook.

HubSpot uses the information you provide to us to contact you about our relevant content, products, and services. You may unsubscribe from these communications at any time. For more information, check out our privacy policy.","Thank You!","I Downloaded My Facebook Data and It Got Weird Fast","When I found out I could download my entire Facebook data file, the first thing I felt was fear.","How far does it go back? What does it contain? Who has access to it? Will it make me feel old?","The idea popped into my head among mounting headlines around the alleged misuse of personal Facebook user data by analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. I wanted to know what, exactly, those potentially in possession of my data might know about me -- so despite the trepidation, I downloaded it anyway.","The results were not exactly encouraging.","This file had everything -- I mean, everything -- from personal contact records that I don't even have stored on my iPhone anymore, to every single image I had sent someone over Messenger. As the title suggests: Things got weird, fast.","And if you're understandably hesitant about downloading your own data, or just considering it, here's what you can expect -- and what the results mean.","I Downloaded My Facebook Data and Things Got Weird","A Snapshot","When you first download a copy of your data archive and unzip it the compressed file (here's a quick how-to), it'll look something like this:","Open the general \"index.htm,\" and you'll see a quick snapshot of all the data available on you, ranging from your general profile to advertisers who have your contact information. Here's what the \"profile\" section of mine looks like, with a few sections removed for the sake of -- this old thing -- privacy.","Granted, what was available on this page was largely information I voluntarily supplied to Facebook by way of putting it on my profile, like where I went to school or my birthday.","But it was in the other sections and file folders where things started to get weird -- and where I started wondering what potential advertisers or others might be doing with it.","The 'Ads' Section","The \"Ads\" section of my data index file largely consists of an exhaustive list of ad topics that would be of interest to me. Some of them made sense, as they were brands whose Pages I already Liked.","But some of the topics were downright irrelevant and, therefore, befuddling -- like \"fishing bait\" and \"organic compound.\"","But there was also a section for advertisers with my contact information, many of whom were brands and musical artists whose Pages I hadn't Liked.","I had to wonder, why do the Smashing Pumpkins and Beck have my contact information? I hadn't listened to either, really, since my first year of college when -- at risk of dating myself -- Facebook didn't exist yet.","It raises questions about just how accessible this information is, and how widespread the availability of our data might be. While likely a bad actor, I'm inclined to believe that Cambridge Analytica isn't alone in the way it allegedly synthesized Facebook user data to get to the root of what sort of promoted content and messaging would resonate most with people.","It's also unclear how to selectively remove that data, if at all -- which could be a valuable next step for Facebook, says HubSpot Product Lead Daria Marmer.","\"Facebook now needs to take the next step and make data deletion from its platform as easy as data access,\" she explains. \"After all, shouldn't it be at least as easy to remove your history/personal information as it is for advertisers to access it?\"","Messenger Records","That became particularly salient when I discovered that my Facebook data includes a transcript of every Messenger interaction I've had, replete with any photo or video files I may have shared in those conversations.","Again, this might not be new. In an April 2014 earnings call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that as part of the social network's ongoing efforts to personalize any content seen by a given user, it would take \"a couple of different approaches towards more private content as well.\"","In the context of the full remarks, it would appear that Zuckerberg was referring to content promotion in these private conversations -- namely, those taking place on Messenger and WhatsApp (also owned by Facebook).","Those plans are increasingly coming to fruition as of late, by way of in-app ads on Messenger (see below image) and the proposed Messenger Broadcast feature.","At the time, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg positioned these efforts as going strictly towarddisplaying Facebook content that users would be \"genuinely happy to see.\"","But to this day, and among recent events, it remains unclear as to which data is, was, or would be used to help target the \"private content\" Zuckerberg alluded to. However, some believe that any user data authorization, including the kind that eventually led to the alleged misuse by Cambridge Analytica, would include Messenger data and files, too.","This personal revelation comes among recent allegations that, on Android devices, Facebook may have been scraping data on calls made and text messages sent from users' mobile devices -- through the device itself, not the Messenger platform.","Here's what that logged activity looked like for one Android user who discovered this record in his own data file:","Facebook's response to this allegation is that users must explicitly opt into allowing Messenger to access contacts and, it seems, log call and text activity. According to a statement published Sunday:","\"When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history. For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’.\"","But according to Ars Technica writer and editor Sean Gallagher, that's not the experience shared by all Android Users.","Even though he never installed Messenger on the Android devices he's used, Gallagher says that after installing Facebook on his Nexus tablet and Blackphone 2 in 2015, his own archive includes call data from between 2015 and 2016. That's after, he says, never receiving \"an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data.\"","Where We Go From Here","If nothing else, it seems that no one is quite sure how, exactly, personal Facebook user data is being leveraged, in whose possession it might be, and how much information those who have it might be privy to.","\"Tech companies have access to an insane amount of our data -- you can even see for yourself on Facebook and Google exactly what they collect,\" says Henry Franco, HubSpot's social campaign strategy associate. \"My guess is there are a ton of Cambridge Analyticas out there, and people would be horrified to realize how many companies are using their data to gently nudge their decision-making processes.\"","This is why Facebook's own investigations might not be enough.","After several days of silence on the initial Cambridge Analytica data misuse allegations, Zuckerberg finally issued a statement on the matter last Thursday, and has been on an active interview and apology circuit since then.","Case in point: Full-page mea culpa ads in the Sunday editions of the New York Times, Washington Post, and Observer (which is published by Guardian, an outlet Facebook threatened to sue before it first reported on the Cambridge Analytica scandal).","But there have been a few key, repetitive themes underlying Zuckerberg's remarks. The first is an emphasis on the words \"I'm sorry,\" which were notably absent from his official written statement released last week.","The second is Zuckerberg's suggested willingness to appear before lawmakers and other authorities to testify on user data and privacy -- if, as he told Recode, he's \"the person who has the most knowledge on it.\"","And because the Federal Trade Commission confirmed today that it is non-publicly investigating Facebook among its \"substantial concerns about the privacy practices,\" Zuckerberg should be prepared to testify -- especially since he's been called upon to do so by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee (along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter).","It all leads to an increasingly likely outcome: that Facebook and its big tech counterparts will have to bow to the external regulation that it's been visibly dodging for some time.","For example, after allegations first came to light that Facebook was weaponized by foreign agents to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election, many wondered if the network instituted its own onslaught of new rules to avoid facing those from lawmakers.","Zuckerberg says he's not entirely opposed to that outcome, saying in an interview with CNN last week that \"I’m not sure we shouldn’t be regulated.\" But if that is the end result, Facebook likely won't be alone in facing that new level of oversight, as implied by the aforementioned invitation to appear before lawmakers alongside executives from Google and Twitter.","And where such regulation is going to have the greatest ripple effect, according to HubSpot Director of Strategic Partnerships Kevin Raheja, is advertising.","\"Facebook, Twitter, and Google will be subjected to, and also adjust to the regulations, likely at the expense of some revenue,\" he says. \"They will likely have to be selective with advertisers, particularly politically-charged messaging ... not just to protect users, but also their own integrity and their own perceptions.\"","The timing also closely aligns with the GDPR coming into force in May. \"With Zuckerberg being asked to testify in front of Congress,\" says Franco, \"one could wonder if we'll see similar data regulation in the U.S.\"","This is a developing story that I'll monitoring as it unfolds. Questions? Feel free to weigh in onTwitter."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Nix told the committee last month that his firm had not received data from a researcher accused of obtaining millions of Facebook users' personal information.","In Washington, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said on Twitter that Zuckerberg \"needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.\"","\"This is a major breach that must be investigated,\" Klobuchar, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said. \"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves.\"","Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed Klobuchar's complaint.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" he said. \"It's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said on Twitter that \"Massachusetts residents deserve answers\" and announced that her office will investigate.","The officials reacted to reports in The New York Times and The Guardian of London that Cambridge Analytica, which is best known for working on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, had improperly obtained Facebook user data and retained it after claiming it had deleted the information.","Former Cambridge Analytica employee Chris Wylie said that the company obtained information from 50 million Facebook users, using it to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.","Wylie told Britain's Channel 4 news that the company was able to amass a huge database very quickly from an app developed by an academic that vacuumed up data from Facebook users who agreed to fill out a survey, as well as their friends and contacts — a process of which most were unaware.","\"Imagine I go and ask you: I say, 'Hey, if I give you a dollar, two dollars, could you fill up this survey for me, just do it on this app', and you say, 'Fine,'\" he said. \"I don't just capture what your responses are, I capture all of the information about you from Facebook.

In a post on (what else) Facebook, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth gave variations on the line we’ve come to expect from tech in these situations: They’re not supposed to do that, and anyway how could we have known?","“This is the opposite of our business model,” he wrote. “Our interests are aligned with users when it comes to protecting data.” What reason could you possibly have to be skeptical of this declamation?","He said much more than that, of course, and very earnestly indeed, but if you cut through the prevarication here’s the simplified timeline:","Facebook deliberately allows developers to collect a bunch of data from users who authorize it, plus a bunch of their friends. (But developers have to promise they won’t use it in certain ways.)","Shady people take advantage of this choice and collect as much data as possible for use off the Facebook network in ways Facebook can’t predict or control. (The quiz app in question is surely just one of many — this was an incredible opportunity for data snatchers.)","Facebook fails to predict or control use of the data it released, and fails to protect users who never even knew their data had been released. (It also fails to learn that it has failed to control it.)","The rest is noise, as far as I’m concerned. Even if anyone really believes that sharing data about users is not the Facebook business model, who cares what its business model is? Whatever plausible sounding business model it had before didn’t protect anyone, and didn’t stop these characters from collecting and using data in all sorts of shady ways.","Of course there’s the strong possibility that Cambridge Analytica and others misused the data, didn’t delete it as promised, performed unsanctioned analyses on it. Oh no! Who would have thought someone would do that? The real question was what was Facebook expecting when it handed out data on millions essentially on the honor system?","Facebook’s business model is monetizing your data (the data you give it, it must be said), one way or the other.

And Facebook failed to protect its users' privacy and misrepresented how their data would be used, the lawsuit says.","\"(Facebook) sought to keep developers building on its platform and provide companies with all the tools they need to influence and manipulate user behavior,\" the suit says. \"That's because Facebook is not a social media company; it is the largest data mining operation in existence.\"","The lawsuit joins others brought against the social media giant and Cambridge Analytica in response to a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London earlier this month. The newspapers reported that Cambridge Analytica, whose U.K.-based parent SCL Group was also named in Cook County's suit, gained access to private information of more than 50 million Facebook users, including their profiles, locations and what they like. The firm claimed its tools could analyze voters' personalities and influence their behavior with targeted messages.","At least five lawsuits have been filed in federal court in Northern California over the alleged misuse of user data. Those include a suit from a Facebook shareholder who is seeking class-action status, claiming he and other company shareholders have suffered losses and damages since the Cambridge Analytica news was first reported, and another from a woman seeking class-action status over Facebook and Cambridge Analytica's alleged improper data collection.","Since the report about Cambridge Analytica was published, a public conversation about deleting Facebook profiles has sprung up, and the privacy of people's online information has come into question. Some experts say that deleting a Facebook profile can't protect the decade's worth of data users have already poured into the platform.","The Federal Trade Commission on Monday confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook's data practices, and U.K. investigators reportedly raided Cambridge Analytica's offices in London late last week.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post last week that the company took steps several years ago to make sure users' data aren't accessed this way again. He also promised that the company would do more to protect its users' data. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he wrote.","Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired the information, Facebook has said, but it didn't steal the data. Users allowed the maker of a personality quiz app to take the data. About 270,000 people took the quiz several years ago, and the app-maker was able to scrape data from their Facebook friends. He then provided the data to Cambridge Analytica.","Still, Facebook told its users that their personal data would be protected, according to the Cook County lawsuit. It engaged in unfair and deceptive conduct when it allowed a third party to collect its users' data, the suit alleges.","The lawsuit, filed by Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx on behalf of the people of Illinois, brings one count each against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica for allegedly violating the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.","The suit asks that both companies be fined $50,000 for each violation of the law and that Cambridge Analytica be fined an additional $10,000 for each day a violation affecting an Illinois resident age 65 or older has existed.","The companies \"must be held accountable for their actions,\" Foxx said in a statement.","\"Cambridge Analytica deliberately misled Facebook users so it could build psychological profiles of the user and their friends, and Facebook did not stop it,\" she said in the statement. \"This blatant deception violated Illinois law and more importantly violated the privacy of Illinois residents.\"","Cook County is being represented by Chicago law firm Edelson, which has brought privacy suits against Facebook and other tech companies, including Google and Netflix.","Internet security advocates have argued that there aren't enough laws to protect consumer privacy. Companies often lean on terms of service that consumers sign before using an app or service, but few actually read that fine print. Even if they do, some experts say it is nearly impossible for users to know the extent to which their data could be used.","Facebook said it could not comment immediately on the lawsuit, and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment.","Cambridge Analytica has previously denied any wrongdoing and suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix. The app developer, Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who is not named in the Cook County suit, told the BBC last week that he didn't know the data would be used for Trump's election campaign and that Cambridge Analytica is using him as a scapegoat."],"isopubdate":""}

Burck, an attorney for Bannon, said in a statement on Bannon's behalf: \"The first Mr. Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.

The company's actions in the US and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators.","The firm specialised in voter-profiling and was involved in US political campaigns in the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential race. To improve its models, the firm reportedly worked with Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University academic, who built the app that got Facebook users to take a survey.","Kogan passed on the data to Cambridge Analytica, though it is disputed whether any privacy rules were broken in this process.","Related articles:","Wylie claimed that when a Facebook user took the survey, data would be scraped from hundreds of their friends' online profiles without their knowledge.

What is clear is that the services Cambridge Analytica offered are increasingly coveted by modern political campaigns.","Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least US$6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.

In doing so, it overturned the long dominance of TV advertising in U.S. politics and created something new in the world: a national campaign run like a local ward election, where the interests of individual voters were known and addressed.","This is Part 3 of our in-depth profile of the big data techniques that gave Barack Obama a second term in office. Read Part 1 and Part 2.","The March","In the summer of 2011, Carol Davidsen received a message from Dan Wagner. Already the Obama campaign was known for its relentless e-mails beseeching supporters to give their money or time, but this one offered something that intrigued Davidsen: a job. Wagner had sorted the campaign’s list of donors, stretching back to 2008, to find those who described their occupation with terms like “data” and “analytics” and sent them all invitations to apply for work in his new analytics department.","Davidsen was working at Navic Networks, a Microsoft-owned company that wrote code for set-top cable boxes to create a record of a user’s DVR or tuner history, when she heeded Wagner’s call. One year before Election Day, she started work in the campaign’s technology department to serve as product manager for Narwhal. That was the code name, borrowed from a tusked whale, for an ambitious effort to match records from previously unconnected databases so that a user’s online interactions with the campaign could be synchronized. With Narwhal, e-mail blasts asking people to volunteer could take their past donation history into consideration, and the algorithms determining how much a supporter would be asked to contribute could be shaped by knowledge about his or her reaction to previous solicitations. This integration enriched a technique, common in website development, that Obama’s online fund-raising efforts had used to good effect in 2008: the A/B test, in which users are randomly directed to different versions of a thing and their responses are compared. Now analysts could leverage personal data to identify the attributes of those who responded, and use that knowledge to refine subsequent appeals. “You can cite people’s other types of engagement,” says ­Amelia ­Showalter, Obama’s director of digital analytics. “We discovered that there were a lot of things that built goodwill, like signing the president’s birthday card or getting a free bumper sticker, that led them to become more engaged with the campaign in other ways.”","If online communication had been the aspect of the 2008 campaign subjected to the most rigorous empirical examination—it’s easy to randomly assign e-mails in an A/B test and compare click-through rates or donation levels—mass-media strategy was among those that received the least. Television and radio ads had to be purchased by geographic zone, and the available data on who watches which channels or shows, collected by research firms like Nielsen and Scarborough, often included little more than viewer age and gender. That might be good enough to guide buys for Schick or Foot Locker, but it’s of limited value for advertisers looking to define audiences in political terms.","As campaign manager Jim Messina prepared to spend as much as half a billion dollars on mass media for Obama’s reëlection, he set out to reinvent the process for allocating resources across broadcast, cable, satellite, and online channels. “If you think about the universe of possible places for an advertiser, it’s almost infinite,” says Amy Gershkoff, who was hired as the campaign’s media-planning director on the strength of her successful negotiations, while at her firm Changing Targets in 2009, to link the information from cable systems to individual microtargeting profiles. “There are tens of millions of opportunities where a campaign can put its next dollar. You have all this great, robust voter data that doesn’t fit together with the media data. How you knit that together is a challenge.”","By the start of 2012, ­Wagner had deftly wrested command of media planning into his own department. As he expanded the scope of analytics, he defined his purview as “the study and practice of resource optimization for the purpose of improving programs and earning votes more efficiently.” That usually meant calculating, for any campaign activity, the number of votes gained through a given amount of contact at a given cost.","But when it came to buying media, such calculations had been simply impossible, because campaigns were unable to link what they knew about voters to what cable providers knew about their customers. Obama’s advisors decided that the data made available in the private sector had long led political advertisers to ask the wrong questions. Walsh says of the effort to reimagine the media-targeting process: “It was not to get a better understanding of what 35-plus women watch on TV. It was to find out how many of our persuadable voters were watching those dayparts.”","Davidsen, whose previous work had left her intimately familiar with the rich data sets held in set-top boxes, understood that a lot of that data was available in the form of tuner and DVR histories collected by cable providers and then aggregated by research firms. For privacy reasons, however, the information was not available at the individual level. “The hardest thing in media buying right now is the lack of information,” she says.","Davidsen began negotiating to have research firms repackage their data in a form that would permit the campaign to access the individual histories without violating the cable providers’ privacy standards. Under a $350,000 deal she worked out with one company, Rentrak, the campaign provided a list of persuadable voters and their addresses, derived from its microtargeting models, and the company looked for them in the cable providers’ billing files. When a record matched, ­Rentrak would issue it a unique household ID that identified viewing data from a single set-top box but masked any personally identifiable information.","The Obama campaign had created its own television ratings system, a kind of Nielsen in which the only viewers who mattered were those not yet fully committed to a presidential candidate. But Davidsen had to get the information into a practical form by early May, when Obama strategists planned to start running their anti-Romney ads. She oversaw the development of a software platform the Obama staff called the Optimizer, which broke the day into 96 quarter-hour segments and assessed which time slots across 60 channels offered the greatest number of persuadable targets per dollar. (By September, she had unlocked an even richer trove of data: a cable system in Toledo, Ohio, that tracked viewers’ tuner histories by the second.) “The revolution of media buying in this campaign,” says Terry Walsh, who coördinated the campaign’s polling and advertising spending, “was to turn what was a broadcast medium into something that looks a lot more like a narrowcast medium.”","When the Obama campaign did use television as a mass medium, it was because the Optimizer had concluded it would be a more efficient way of reaching persuadable targets. Sometimes a national cable ad was a better bargain than a large number of local buys in the 66 media markets reaching battleground states. But the occasional national buy also had other benefits. It could boost fund-raising and motivate volunteers in states that weren’t essential to Obama’s Electoral College arithmetic. And, says Davidsen, “it helps hide some of the strategy of your buying.”","Even without that tactic, Obama’s buys perplexed the Romney analysts in Boston. They had invested in their own media-intelligence platform, called Centraforce. It used some of the same aggregated data sources that were feeding into the Optimizer, and at times both seemed to send the campaigns to the same unlikely ad blocks—for example, in reruns on TV Land. But there was a lot more to what Alex Lundry, who created Romney’s data science unit, called Obama’s “highly variable” media strategy. Many of the Democrats’ ads were placed in fringe markets, on marginal stations, and at odd times where few political candidates had ever seen value. Romney’s data scientists simply could not decode those decisions without the voter models or persuasion experiments that helped Obama pick out individual targets. “We were never able to figure out the level of advertising and what they were trying to do,” says Romney data analyst Brent McGoldrick. “It wasn’t worth reverse-engineering, because what are you going to do?”","The Community","Although the voter opinion tables that emerged from the Cave looked a lot like polls, the analysts who produced them were disinclined to call them polls. The campaign had plenty of those, generated by a public-opinion team of eight outside firms, and new arrivals at the Chicago headquarters were shocked by the variegated breadth of the research that arrived on their desks daily. “We believed in combining the qual, which we did more than any campaign ever, with the quant, which we [also] did more than any other campaign, to make sure all communication for every level of the campaign was informed by what they found,” says David Simas, the director of opinion research.","Simas considered himself the “air-traffic controller” for such research, which was guided by a series of voter diaries that Obama’s team commissioned as it prepared for the reëlection campaign. “We needed to do something almost divorced from politics and get to the way they’re seeing their lives,” he says. The lead pollster, Joel Benenson, had respondents write about their experiences. The entries frequently used the word “disappointment,” which helped explain attitudes toward Obama’s administration but also spoke to a broader dissatisfaction with economic conditions. “That became the foundation for our entire research program,” says Simas.","Obama’s advisors used those diaries to develop messages that contrasted Obama with Romney as a fighter for the middle class. Benenson’s national polls tested language to see which affected voters’ responses in survey experiments and direct questioning. A quartet of polling firms were assigned specific states and asked to figure out which national themes fit best with local concerns. Eventually, Obama’s media advisors created more than 500 ads and tested them before an online sample of viewers selected by focus-group director David Binder.","But the campaign had to play defense, too. When something potentially damaging popped up in the news, like Democratic consultant Hilary Rosen’s declaration that Ann Romney had “never worked a day in her life,” Simas checked in with the Community, a private online bulletin board populated by 100 undecided voters Binder had recruited. Simas would monitor Community conversations to see which news events penetrated voter consciousness. Sometimes he had Binder show its members controversial material—like a video clip of Obama’s “You didn’t build that” comment—and ask if it changed their views of the candidate. “For me, it was a very quick way to draw back and determine whether something was a problem or not a problem,” says Simas.","When Wagner started packaging his department’s research into something that campaign leadership could read like a poll, a pattern became apparent. Obama’s numbers in key battleground states were low in the analytic tables, but Romney’s were too. There were simply more undecided voters in such states—sometimes nearly twice as many as the traditional pollsters found. A basic methodological distinction explained this discrepancy: microtargeting models required interviewing a lot of unlikely voters to give shape to a profile of what a nonvoter looked like, while pollsters tracking the horse race wanted to screen more rigorously for those likely to cast a ballot. The rivalry between the two units trying to measure public opinion grew intense: the analytic polls were a threat to the pollsters’ primacy and, potentially, to their business model. “I spent a lot of time within the campaign explaining to people that the numbers we get from analytics and the numbers we get from external pollsters did not need strictly to be reconciled,” says Walsh. “They were different.”","The scope of the analytic research enabled it to pick up movements too small for traditional polls to perceive. As Simas reviewed Wagner’s analytic tables in mid-October, he was alarmed to see that what had been a Romney lead of one to two points in Green Bay, Wisconsin, had grown into an advantage of between six and nine. Green Bay was the only media market in the state to experience such a shift, and there was no obvious explanation. But it was hard to discount. Whereas a standard 800-person statewide poll might have reached 100 respondents in the Green Bay area, analytics was placing 5,000 calls in Wisconsin in each five-day cycle—and benefiting from tens of thousands of other field contacts—to produce microtargeting scores. Analytics was talking to as many people in the Green Bay media market as traditional pollsters were talking to across Wisconsin every week. “We could have the confidence level to say, ‘This isn’t noise,’” says Simas. So the campaign’s media buyers aired an ad attacking Romney on outsourcing and beseeched Messina to send former president Bill Clinton and Obama himself to rallies there. (In the end, Romney took the county 50.3 to 48.5 percent.)","For the most part, however, the analytic tables demonstrated how stable the electorate was, and how predictable individual voters could be. Polls from the media and academic institutions may have fluctuated by the hour, but drawing on hundreds of data points to judge whether someone was a likely voter proved more reliable than using a seven-question battery like Gallup’s to do the same. “When you see this Pogo stick happening with the public data—the electorate is just not that volatile,” says Mitch Stewart, director of the Democratic campaign group Organizing for America. The analytic data offered a source of calm.","Romney’s advisors were similarly sanguine, but they were losing. They, too, believed it possible to project the composition of the electorate, relying on a method similar to Gallup’s: pollster Neil Newhouse asked respondents how likely they were to cast a ballot. Those who answered that question with a seven or below on a 10-point scale were disregarded as not inclined to vote. But that ignored the experimental methods that made it possible to measure individual behavior and the impact that a campaign itself could have on a citizen’s motivation. As a result, the Republicans failed to account for voters that the Obama campaign could be mobilizing even if they looked to Election Day without enthusiasm or intensity.","On the last day of the race, Wagner and his analytics staff left the Cave and rode the elevator up one floor in the campaign’s Chicago skyscraper to join members of other departments in a boiler room established to help track votes as they came in. Already, for over a month, Obama’s analysts had been counting ballots from states that allowed citizens to vote early. Each day, the campaign overlaid the lists of early voters released by election authorities with its modeling scores to project how many votes they could claim as their own.","By Election Day, Wagner’s analytic tables turned into predictions. Before the polls opened in Ohio, authorities in Hamilton County, the state’s third-largest and home to Cincinnati, released the names of 103,508 voters who had cast early ballots over the previous month. Wagner sorted them by microtargeting projections and found that 58,379 had individual support scores over 50.1—that is, the campaign’s models predicted that they were more likely than not to have voted for Obama. That amounted to 56.4 percent of the county’s votes, or a raw lead of 13,249 votes over Romney. Early ballots were the first to be counted after Ohio’s polls closed, and Obama’s senior staff gathered around screens in the boiler room to see the initial tally. The numbers settled almost exactly where Wagner had said they would: Obama got 56.6 percent of the votes in Hamilton County. In Florida, he was as close to the mark; Obama’s margin was only two-tenths of a percent off. “After those first two numbers, we knew,” says Bird. “It was dead-on.”","When Obama was reëlected, and by a far larger Electoral College margin than most outsiders had anticipated, his staff was exhilarated but not surprised. The next morning, Mitch Stewart sat in the boiler room, alone, monitoring the lagging votes as they came into Obama’s servers from election authorities in Florida, the last state to name a winner. The presidency was no longer at stake; the only thing that still hung in the balance was the accuracy of the analytics department’s predictions.","The Legacy","A few days after the election, as Florida authorities continued to count provisional ballots, a few staff members were directed, as four years before, to remain in Chicago. Their instructions were to produce another post-mortem report summing up the lessons of the past year and a half. The undertaking was called the Legacy Project, a grandiose title inspired by the idea that the innovations of Obama 2012 should be translated not only to the campaign of the next Democratic candidate for president but also to governance. Obama had succeeded in convincing some citizens that a modest adjustment to their behavior would affect, however marginally, the result of an election. Could he make them feel the same way about Congress?","Simas, who had served in the White House before joining the team, marveled at the intimacy of the campaign. Perhaps more than anyone else at headquarters, he appreciated the human aspect of politics. This had been his first presidential election, but before he became a political operative, Simas had been a politician himself, serving on the city council and school board in his hometown of Taunton, Massachusetts. He ran for office by knocking on doors and interacting individually with constituents (or those he hoped would become constituents), trying to track their moods and expectations.","In many respects, analytics had made it possible for the Obama campaign to recapture that style of politics. Though the old guard may have viewed such techniques as a disruptive force in campaigns, they enabled a presidential candidate to view the electorate the way local candidates do: as a collection of people who make up a more perfect union, each of them approachable on his or her terms, their changing levels of support and enthusiasm open to measurement and, thus, to respect. “What that gave us was the ability to run a national presidential campaign the way you’d do a local ward campaign,” Simas says. “You know the people on your block. People have relationships with one another, and you leverage them so you know the way they talk about issues, what they’re discussing at the coffee shop.”","Few events in American life other than a presidential election touch 126 million adults, or even a significant fraction that many, on a single day. Certainly no corporation, no civic institution, and very few government agencies ever do. Obama did so by reducing every American to a series of numbers. Yet those numbers somehow captured the individuality of each voter, and they were not demographic classifications. The scores measured the ability of people to change politics—and to be changed by it.","This story was updated on December 18 to correct the description of Neil Newhouse’s poll for the Republicans.","You've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nThis is your last free article this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read all your free articles this month.\nSubscribe now for unlimited online access.\nYou've read\nof three\nfree articles this month.\nLog in for more, or subscribe now for unlimited online access.\nLog in for two more free articles, or subscribe now\nfor unlimited online access."],"isopubdate":"2014-03-20"}

If you want to run an ad on Instagram, you do it through the Facebook ad tool. And both Instagram and Facebook share the data they collect about you with each other and advertisers.","So there is no such thing as Instagram-only ads?","Brands and marketers can choose to have ads run only on Instagram and not show up on Facebook. But they still have to place the ads through the Facebook ad manager. So yes, ads can be tailored to only appear on Instagram, but all of that is handled in Facebook’s ad system.","Advertisers can target you based on both your Facebook AND Instagram accounts.","They are essentially one and the same, as far as advertising is concerned. Advertisers can target you on your Instagram based on your Facebook profile, and they can target you on Facebook using information collected from your Instagram account.","What if my Instagram and Facebook are totally different, though?","Let’s say your Facebook is pretty normal, but your Instagram is something totally weird or specific, like only pictures of your dog, and you only follow viral dog accounts.

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful U.S. watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident. The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap. As a result, the new probe carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant, which is facing similar investigations in Europe.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on two panels -- the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee – already have invited Zuckerberg to testify at two upcoming hearings. But lawmakers have not indicated if they would seek to subpoena the Facebook executive if he declined to attend or sought to send another company official in his place.","The Senate Judiciary Committee panel, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election.","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending information over misuse of data.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Nix told the same MPs: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office.","It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in the largest ever breach of Facebook data.","Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence he supplied to authorities in the UK and US includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he told the Observer. “That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile information, but it was for research purposes only.","So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing of Facebook data.","Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica told the Observer that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

In addition to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee has also asked him to testify, and members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee have voiced an interest in questioning him.","Zuckerberg has declined, however, to agree to requests from Damian Collins, the U.K. Parliament’s media committee chair, to appear for questioning. Instead, Facebook says, the company’s Chief Technology Officer, Mike Schroepfer, or Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, would make the appearance.","Facebook has been under heightened scrutiny since revelations that it was weaponized by foreign agents to spread misinformation and divisive content to help influence the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. The recent pressure to appear before Congress, however, is largely the result of allegations that personal user data was misused by analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.","Since then, authorities and users alike have been taking a closer look at Facebook’s privacy policies, as well as the details of what sort of data the social network has allowed third parties to collect.","Zuckerberg’s verbal willingness to appear and testify before authorities has many wondering if Facebook — along with its Big Tech counterparts like Google and Twitter — will finally relent on its fight against government regulation. The events are taking place on the heels of the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) coming into force this May, which concerns the personal data of EU citizens.","This is a developing story that I’ll be monitoring as it unfolds.

These new stories, backed by Wylie’s account and internal documents, followed years of reporting by The Guardianand The Intercept about the possible problem.","The details could seem Byzantine. Aleksandr Kogan, then a Cambridge academic, founded a company, Global Science Research, and immediately took on a major client, Strategic Communication Laboratories, which eventually gave birth to Cambridge Analytica. (Steve Bannon, an adviser to the company and a former senior adviser to Trump, reportedly picked the name.)","The promise of Kogan’s company was that they could build psychological profiles of vast numbers of people by using Facebook data. Those profiles, in turn, might be useful to tune the political messages that Cambridge Analytica sent to potential voters. Perhaps a certain kind of message might appeal more to extroverts, or narcissists, or agreeable people.","To gather that data, the Times reports, Kogan hired workers through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to install a Facebook app in their accounts. The app, built by Global Science Research, requested an unusual (but not unheard-of) amount of data about users themselves and their friends. That’s how 270,000 Turkers ended up yielding 30 million profiles of American Facebook users that could be matched with other data sets.","From the current reporting, it seems that Kogan violated Facebook’s terms of service in saying he was using the data for academic research, but then selling it to Strategic Communications Laboratories. That’s what got Cambridge Analytica and Kogan in trouble. (Cambridge Analytica told The Guardian that they do not have possession of the data nor did they use any of this data in the 2016 election. An anonymous source in the Times story disputes this.)","There’s a lot about Cambridge Analytica that doesn’t quite add up. Are they data geniuses who swung the Brexit vote and got Trump elected, or pretenders bluffing their way to fat marketing contracts? Right after the election, several stories pointed to their psychological profiles of voters as a crucial piece of the Trump digital machine. As time has gone on, their role has come to be seen as less important, more in line with the tiny slice of the Trump campaign treasury that they got, roughly $6 million.","While the specifics of this particular violation are important to understand, the story reveals deeper truths about the online world that operates through and within Facebook.","First, some of Facebook’s growth has been driven by apps, which the company found extended the amount of time that people spent on the platform, as retired users of FarmVille could attest. To draw developers, Facebook had quite lax (or, as one might say, “developer-friendly”) data policies for years.","Academic researchers began publishing warnings that third-party Facebook apps represented a major possible source of privacy leakage in the early 2010s. Some noted that the privacy risks inherent in sharing data with apps were not at all clear to users. One group termed our new reality “interdependent privacy,” because your Facebook friends, in part, determine your own level of privacy.","For as long as apps have existed, they have asked for a lot of data and people have been prone to give it to them. Back in 2010, Penn State researchers systematically recorded what data the top 1,800 apps on Facebook were asking for. They presented their results in 2011 with the paper “Third-Party Apps on Facebook: Privacy and the Illusion of Control.” The table below shows that 148 apps were asking for permission to access friends’ information.","Pennsylvania State University","But that’s not the only way that friends leak their friends’ data. Take the example of letting an app see your photos. As the Penn State researchers show, all kinds of data can be harvested: who’s tagged in photos, who liked any of the pictures, who commented on them, and what they said.","If one were to systematically crawl through all the data that could be gleaned from just a user’s basic information, one could build a decent picture of that person’s social world, including a substantial amount of information about their friends.","Facebook has tightened up some of its policies in recent years, especially around apps accessing friends’ data. But TheGuardian’s reporting suggests that the company’s efforts to restuff Pandora’s box have been lax. Wylie, the whistleblower, received a letter from Facebook asking him to delete any Facebook data nearly two years after the existence of the data was first reported. “That to me was the most astonishing thing,” Wylie told The Guardian. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","But even if Facebook were maximally aggressive about policing this kind of situation, what’s done is done. It’s not just that the data escaped, but that Cambridge Analytica almost certainly learned everything they could from it. As stated in The Guardian, the contract between GSR and Strategic Communications Laboratories states, specifically, “The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information.”","It’s important to dwell on this. It’s not that this research was supposed to identify every U.S. voter just from this data, but rather to develop a method for sorting people based on Facebook’s profiles. Wylie believes that the data was crucial in building Cambridge Analytica’s models. It certainly seems possible that once the “training set” had been used to learn how to psychologically profile people, this specific data itself was no longer necessary. But the truth is that no one knows if the Kogan data had much use out in the real world of political campaigning. Psychological profiling sounds nefarious, but the way that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica first attempted to do it may well have proven, as the company maintains, “fruitless.”","So what is to be done? It’s possible that these new stories will cause Facebook to restrict the use of its data by people outside the company, including legitimate researchers. But that kind of self-imposed or external regulation would not strike at what’s actually scary about these efforts.","If Cambridge Analytica’s targeted advertising works, people worry they could be manipulated with information—or even thoughts—that they did not consent to giving anyone. And societally, a democracy running on micro-targeted political advertisements tuned specifically for ever tinier slices of the population is in trouble, as scholars like Zeynep Tufekci warned in 2012 (and in 2014).","Those two concerns extend far beyond Cambridge Analytica. In fact, the best system for micro-targeting ads, political or otherwise, to particularly persuadable segments of the population is Facebook itself. This is why Facebook’s market value is half a trillion dollars.","In Facebook’s ad system, there are no restrictions on sending ads to people based on any “targetable” attribute, like older men who are interested in the “Confederate States of America” and the National Rifle Association and who are “likely to engage with political content (conservative).”","A screenshot from Facebook’s ad-purchasing platform (Alexis Madrigal)","That’s to say nothing of the ability to create databases of people from other sources—electoral rolls, data on purchasing habits or group affiliations, or anything gleaned by the hundreds of online data companies—then letting Facebook itself match those people up to their Facebook accounts. Facebook might never reveal the names in an audience to advertisers or political campaigns, but the effects are the same.","Facebook’s laxity and the researcher’s malfeasance are newsworthy. But is the problem with privacy-obviating social networks, psychological profiling, and political micro-targeting that some researcher violated Facebook’s terms of service? Or is it that this controversy estranges the whole enterprise, providing a route to approach the almost unthinkable changes that have come to democratic processes in the Facebook era?","We want to hear what you think about this article.

The core challenge was to identify the floating/swing voters for each of the parties and to measure their levels electoral apathy, a result of the poor and unchanging condition of the state after 15 years of incumbent rule,” its section on India notes.","The voter research and psychological profiling firm points out that its client (Janata Dal United) achieved a “landslide victory, with “over 90% of total seats targeted by CA” being won.","In the 2010 election, the JD(U), which was already in power in Bihar, increased its seat tally from 88 to 115 in the 243-seat assembly. Its partner at the time, increased its seats from 55 to 91.","The only catch, however, is that Cambridge Analytica (CA) was officially formed and created only in 2013 by its parent company, the London-based Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) Group.","SCL’s roots and work in India – from 2010, starting with the Bihar state elections – came from an unlikely source: Amrish Tyagi, the son of senior Janata Dal (United) leader K.C. Tyagi, who runs Ghaziabad-based Ovlene Business Intelligence (OBI).","OBI is Cambridge Analytica’s go-to company on the ground in the Indian subcontinent.","“If you are going to pitch any big client, they require experience. We can use their experience, they can also use our experience. We collaborate our expertise, there’s nothing wrong with that,” the 39-year-old Amrish Tyagi told The Wire, when asked why CA listed the 2010 Bihar elections as part of its work portfolio when it clearly didn’t exist then.","“We complement each other’s services. From the ground-level, we conduct the data [sic] and we share with them,” Tyagi added.","Who are Tyagi and CA’s big clients on the horizon in India? According to multiple reports, the firms could be looking to land the Congress and BJP and offer their services for the upcoming 2019 general elections. OBI’s own website already lists both parties as clients.","Nudging voters","Cambridge Analytica and its parent firm, the SCL Group, are, to put it bluntly, in the business of understanding and changing the behaviour of voters.","They claim that by analysing huge amounts of user and consumer data – and combining it with its secret sauce, a behavioural science model – they can “identify the most persuadable voters” and “move them to action”.","Even before this weekend, the company’s role in the 2016 US election, which saw Donald Trump elected, and the Brexit vote has sparked controversy and attracted the intention of regulators and government officials across multiple countries.","For new-age election strategy firms like CA, the digital footprints that people leave behind while using social networks and mobile applications are the secret to influencing voter behaviour.","A few dozen Facebook likes, they claim, can help in revealing everything from preference for a particular political party to what extent one may be vulnerable to substance abuse. In 2015, when it burst into the scene of American politics, Cambridge Analytica boasted that it had “5,000 data points on every American” and claimed that it had used it to build “extensive personality profiles” that can be used for “psychographic targeting”.","The strength of their [Kosinski and his Cambridge colleagues] modeling was illustrated by how well it could predict a subject’s answers. Kosinski continued to work on the models incessantly: before long, he was able to evaluate a person better than the average work colleague, merely on the basis of ten Facebook “likes.” Seventy “likes” were enough to outdo what a person’s friends knew, 150 what their parents knew, and 300 “likes” what their partner knew. More “likes” could even surpass what a person thought they knew about themselves.","While the efficacy of such methods has been hotly debated, there is little doubt that CA and SCL have managed to market these tools well, turning it into a lucrative business.","This weekend, news broke that in 2014, Cambridge Analytica had hired a UK-based research firm (Global Science Research, GSR) to harvest nearly 50 million Facebook profiles – the majority of which were collated and collected in violation of Facebook’s policies.","Essentially, GSR collected this information through an app on the site – it collected not only the details of American users who were paid to take a personality test, but also wrongly (and likely illegally) hoovered up the data of the test takers’ Facebook friends.","One day before the news broke, Facebook announced that it had banned Cambridge Analytica over allegations that it had held onto improperly obtained user data even after promising that it had deleted the information.","On Monday, following the telecast of a Channel 4 investigation in which Cambridge Analytica executives are filmed tellings reporters – who posed as Sri Lankan clients looking for an electoral edge – talking of dirty tricks including the use of bribery and honey traps, British officials were quoted as saying they would seek a warrant to force the firm to hand over the data it had used in some of its election-related campaigns.","SCL, CA and India","In an interaction with The Wire, Tyagi denied that such tactics were used in any of OBL’s political campaigns in India, but also refused to admit that Cambridge Analytica or SCL had done anything wrong.","“Nothing has been established yet. They [CA and SCL] are looking after the issue. I am in touch with their senior officials and they are denying the allegations. They are looking for legal action against whoever is trying to malign them. I also don’t think they have breached any ethical or legal rules here in India,” he said.","The relationship between Tyagi and Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) goes back over seven years now. SCL’s raison d’etre is to provide “data analytics and strategy to governments and military organisations” and over the last 25 years they have “conducted behavioural change programs in over 60 countries”.","Tyagi says that they started out by complementing each other’s offerings – especially in South Asia by “providing logistics” among other services.","SCL’s website lists two major projects in the Indian subcontinent, both of which deal with psychological profiling.","One, they carried out a campaign in Nepal to help the government “reduce and ultimately stop large numbers of Maoist insurgents from breaking into houses”. And two, a separate initiative in Afghanistan to “understand the behaviours and attitudes of the local Afghan population regarding sensitive topics such as religious affairs and local governance”.","In 2009-2019, SCL and Tyagi apparently worked on a project that “assessed the phenomenon of honour killings in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan”","Tyagi and some of SCL’s senior management – including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, the man currently in the centre of the Facebook controversy – evidently had ideas of establishing a firm India presence.","Documents from the corporate affairs ministry show that Ovleno Business Intelligence (through Amrish Tyagi) and SCL set up and incorporated an India entity in late 2011 (called Strategic Communications Laboratories Pvt Limited), with Alexander Nix also coming on board as a director. Other founder directors included one Avneesh Kumar Rai and Alexander Oakes.","It’s unclear what SCL India actually has done since then – OBI’s website describes it has having “permanent offices in ten states…with a further 30 branch offices, some 300 permanent employees and over 1,400 consulting staff”.","Tyagi, however, is vague about SCL India and its goals. He states that the “plan was very simple” – “to explore political and social projects in the Indian subcontinent”.","However, he points out that nothing has “happened yet”, implying that both SCL India and Cambridge are yet to get to work in the country’s vast electoral campaigning market.","OBI and Tyagi, however, have worked on a number of political projects in India – starting from helping the BJP’s Rajnath Singh in the local Ghaziabad elections in 2009 to working on the 2015 Bihar and Delhi assembly elections.","Not Facebook but big data","The JD(U) leader’s son, insists though that no Facebook-specific psychological profiling is done here in India. However, it’s clear that digital data plays an increasingly relevant role.","“Most of the information we gather is in public domain. Based on where you shop, the music you buy from the Apple store, trips to the hair salon. It’s easy nowadays to identify individual tastes and habits. And then accordingly, create messages. Everyday we receive commercial messages,” he stated in an interview in 2017.","Being able to quickly react to social media warfare also appears to be key to OBI and Tyagi’s strategy. During the Bihar elections in 2015, Tyagi points out that a photo of Nitish Kumar hugging a tantrik started going viral. “We had to counter this. Within a few minutes we came out with a 2014 photo of Smriti Irani in which she was showing her hand to an astrologer in Rajasthan who told her that she will very soon be the president of India. You have to be very quick to counter,” he pointed out.","Move and counter-move: When an image of JD(U) leader hugging a tantrik emerged in the 2015 Bihar elections, OBI dug out and circulated an image of Smriti Irani consulting an astrologer. Credit: Twitter","His second-in-command, according to the OBI website, is one Himanshu Sharma, whose profile indicates that he managed “four election campaigns successfully for the ruling party BJP” including achieving “Mission 272+ by managing a call centre management project”. Sharma also apparently helped in “confidentially maintaining the database to be provided constituency-wise to BJP candidate as an additional support for national elections and state elections of Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi”.","While Tyagi concedes that the people at SCL and Cambridge Analytica are “technically very sound”, he insists that they have not helped OBI and its campaigns in a “digital capacity”. OBI’s work mostly consists of on-the-ground management including looking at demographic and caste dynamics.","“[In politics], we can blame anyone. In India, there is complaining over EVMs and abroad it is about [digital profiling]. If anyone establishes [wrong-doing] we will think about it [cutting ties]. Right now, we are very comfortable with them.”"],"isopubdate":""}

A few kids sense I’m going off script and will say Jesus or Michael Jordan. I offer up the US dollar. Near 100% recognition, owns a color, unique associations, and extraordinary trust.","We personify brands and have pseudo‑relationships with them. If that sounds fucked up, trust your instincts. It’s the same sort of fucked up as loyalty to institutions, which I don’t understand. I tell my students to be loyal to people, not to inanimate brands or organizations. The former may or may not take care of you when you’re older, but I’m certain the latter won’t.","We’ve placed a great deal of value around the trust component of brands, as for a long time it wasn’t a given that you could trust the brand to treat you well. They had products that gave us cancer, appliances without warning labels, devices that broke down. Brands often refused to stand behind their product or give you your money back if you were unhappy with it. But in the nineties and aughts, brand strength was synonymous with trust, which was based on brand experience and associations. We grew to trust brands the more we used them, and the better they treated us. The kindness, courtesy, and effort brands put into their relationships with us evokes the preferential treatment of select societies.","In a culture that sees the consumer as our nobility, potential risks of choosing the wrong brand are minimal. Instead of trust, the new points of differentiation are competition and transparency. Now, what’s more important to consumers, rather than trust, is delight. Whether it’s my dad returning a sweater years later, no questions asked, Nordstrom bringing cufflinks to my hotel room before a wedding, or Amazon Now getting an order to my desk in 47 minutes, we have an arms race around delighting, vs. trusting.","Enter New","So, as consumers no longer need to worry as much about the downside, we’ve raised the bar and no longer need to defer to the known and trusted brand. Our expectation is that any brand will treat us relatively well. We’ve replaced trust with different, special, new. We used to ask, “What’s the best hotel in London?” Now, it’s “What’s the hot new hotel in London?” We have weapons of discovery that can find new and get us to a level 10 satisfaction (great and new), vs. the trusted 8 (great and same). Our instinct to diversify the gene pool and seek competition triggers excitement when we find the great new thing.","This has played out in business results. In nearly every consumer sector, small, independent brands are increasingly taking a bite out of larger‑scale players. Between 2013 and 2016 craft breweries went from 9.4% to 12.3% of beer production in the US. Craft alone is no longer cool enough, and in 2016 the smallest guys — microbreweries and brew pubs — drove 90% of craft brew growth. A similar story has played out in the booming beauty sector, where indie brands were up a staggering 43% in 2016. In activewear, Nike and Adidas face competition from ankle‑biters Allbirds and Outdoor Voices, who have established a foothold among millennials in urban markets like San Francisco and New York. And in CPG, long controlled by corporate giants, the only thing the fastest‑growing brands in e-commerce (read: growth channel) have in common is that most of us have never heard of them.","So what’s a brand to do in an era of new vs. trust?","— What’s old is new again. Heritage or vintage product has an interesting blend of trust with new, as it’s from a trusted brand, but we haven’t seen that product in a while. Adidas saw its shares swell 104% in two years on the blend of trust and new we feel with vintage Stan Smiths and Superstars.","— New is a direct function of your supply chain ability. Most consumer boards I serve on try to establish a metric around agility (time from concept to shelf). Agility is the strongest signal when finding drivers of YOY growth among retailers.","— Adding new across the supply chain. If this sounds like a dumbed-down way of saying “innovation,” you’re right. Apple, Warby Parker, and MAC Cosmetics created billions in shareholder value by fomenting new in the retail channel, as achieving new in product was increasingly hard / expensive.","— Embrace new media. One of the new competencies of winners in the consumer space is facility with Instagram. A brand’s facility with new media is an indicator of cool and new — the company you keep, so to speak. Burberry reanimated a tired brand by embracing new media and committing to being the early adopter across every new platform. Being an early adopter is usually expensive, but investing in social media isn’t.","— Embrace voice and messaging. It helps to be a leader and invest early in the medium or technologies that are booming. You have the wind at your back, and those who follow won’t bask in as bright a glow. The greatest opportunity for “new” right now is facility and programming with voice and messaging. Take all your IOT, VR, and 3D printing initiatives and shit-can them (reallocate the capital). Figure out a way to communicate with existing and new consumers via messaging, and encourage people to interact with your product via voice.","Trust me on this …","DOJ vs. CNN","“Save us from CNN,” said nobody, ever.","The Department of Justice has threatened AT&T that it would block the acquisition of Time Warner unless AT&T sells off CNN.","This. Is. Insane.","Some questions for the DOJ:","Isn’t asking AT&T to sell CNN like asking Kenny Rogers to fire his bassist, as he could become too powerful?","Google has 90% share of search, a market greater by dollar volume than the ad market of all nations except the US. But AT&T needs to sell CNN?","Amazon Prime is in 64% of US households and spends $4.5B on content.

The company said last week that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked for the Trump campaign, and a professor, Aleksandr Kogan, who is said to have deceptively amassed information from more than 50 million people without their consent. That may sound like decisive action, but it came more than two years after Facebook learned of the problem.","Starting in 2014, Mr. Kogan got the data, using a quiz app, under the guise of academic research. He handed the information to Cambridge Analytica, which used it to build profiles of voters’ personalities, according to reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London on Saturday.","What is particularly disturbing about this case is that Facebook has not yet identified and alerted users whose profile information was vacuumed up by the app, most of whom had never used it but were friends with somebody else who had. Further, Facebook did not verify that Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan deleted the data after the social media company told them to in 2015. The Times reported that Cambridge still had most or all of the data.","Facebook’s response so far is reminiscent of its slow, defensive reaction to the spread of pro-Trump fake news on its platform during the 2016 presidential campaign. Days after the election, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said it was a “pretty crazy idea” to suggest that fake news had influenced the outcome. It took months for him to admit that he was wrong to so cavalierly dismiss the importance of hoaxes spread on Facebook, many of them by people working on behalf of the Russian government.","It is hard to know just how useful the profile information from Facebook was in Cambridge’s effort to help elect Mr. Trump. The company has offered contradictory statements about its use of what’s called “psychographic data” for the campaign, which included targeting political messages to voters receptive to them. The trove contained enough details about roughly 30 million people, including where they lived, that the company was able to build detailed profiles by linking the data to other sources of information.","Officials in the United States and the European Union are investigating Cambridge Analytica, and others say they might, including members of Congress and the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey. In Britain, regulators and lawmakers are looking at whether the company tried to illegally influence the “Brexit” referendum of 2016.","More investigations may be on the way. On Monday, Channel 4 News in Britain released hidden-camera tapes in which Cambridge executives said that their company used bribes and prostitutes to entrap politicians. The company denies engaging in corruption and extortion. Robert Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who is a big supporter of Mr. Trump, owns a controlling stake in Cambridge, and Stephen Bannon, the former chief strategist for the president, is a former company board member.","Lawmakers and regulators also ought to investigate Facebook’s response. For starters, they need to take a close look at whether the company is in violation of a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused it of deceiving users by telling them their information would be kept private and then allowing it to be shared and made public. They also need to force the company to quickly identify and alert the tens of millions of people whose information might have been disclosed to Cambridge.","In the longer term, Congress clearly needs to strengthen privacy laws to give people more control over private information and prevent businesses and political campaigns from harvesting personal data under false pretenses. President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights in 2012, but the idea died in Congress after technology and advertising companies claimed it would be an unfair burden.","Facebook says it takes this case seriously. But it is clear that lawmakers cannot rely on the company to police itself."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But what if we told you that many of these could be stealing or mining your personal data.","Considering the smartphone market in India is expanding by the day and the internet costs less than peanuts, it’s no surprise that the number of active users playing these games and interacting with these online applications is also growing rapidly.","The recent “Cambridge Analytica” fiasco has opened yet another can of worms for not only such Facebook users, but also numerous data mining organisations that heavily bank upon the user’s data.","You can know more about how to safeguard your online data in the Facebook live below:","This Ain’t No Game","Facebook’s data servers and its whole digital infrastructure is a fortress, and even impregnable in certain ways, but recent events make way for certain skepticism on how safe is the data that Facebook users are sharing online.","India is the largest user of Facebook, and the avid social media user invests an adequate amount of time online playing games like Criminal Case, Farmville and even Texas HoldEm Poker (top games being played by Indian users). And guess what, all these games need you to sign up with your Facebook account.","Most of the games on Facebook need to access your Facebook ID(Photo: Facebook.com screenshot)","However, apart from these, there are a lot of interactive applications/games that people play and they not only have to log in through Facebook, but they also have to provide access to sensitive data like location, contacts, and even your phone’s gallery!","Games/apps like “Who has a secret crush on you?” or “ What would you look like as the opposite-sex? ” are some common examples.","Some users are so overwhelmed by the curiosity that they tend to ignore some of the risks involved, and inadvertently give the app access to sensitive data.","The whole ‘Cambridge Analytica’ debacle is based on the data leaked on a similar app developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who collected the data and passed it to Cambridge Analytica. The app called ‘This is Your Digital Life’ on Facebook mined nearly 2,70,000 user’ data.","According to The Verge, the ex-Cambridge Analytica employee and a whistle-blower has called the whole thing as an “unethical act” as it was carried out without Facebook’s knowledge and many others were kept in the dark.","I suppose the most worrying bit is that something like this could be happening in India, which could even have a boding on how our general elections pan out!","What’s More Important: Your Privacy or Fun?","Facebook users playing these online games click on random applications to know details like “Which Game of Thrones character are you?” or “When will you get married?” However, you need to realise there is a lot at stake here!","Certain apps on Facebook require your permission to post and let you use the app.(Photo: Facebook.com screenshot)","You can also disable the option where Facebook displays ads on you page based on the websites you visit. Here’s How:","Go to your Facebook profile’s Settings.","In Settings, click on the Ads option on the left.","Select ‘Off’ as an option in the “ Ads based on your use of websites and apps” tab.","You can prevent Facebook from displaying targeted ads on your homepage(Photo: Facebook.com screenshot)","However, there is also a way for users who use the Facebook app on the mobiles to know what apps have their data. Here’s how you can track all the apps:","Tap the app’s Settings tab on the top right corner.","Scroll down and select the “Privacy Shortcuts” option.","Select the first option “Privacy Checkup” and tap next till you reach “Your App Privacy” option.","Below is the video demo of the same.","It’s always recommended that you delete or deny access to the apps that you do not use anymore. It’s much safer that way.","But, if you must absolutely use these kind of app to find out “when you will get married?” it’s in your best interest to deny the app any kind of access to your contacts list, friends list, and location to prevent these apps from gaining access to your data.","And, if the apps do not let you proceed further, so be it. Think about it, what’s more important? A little fun or your privacy?","(The Quint is now on WhatsApp. To receive handpicked stories on topics you care about, subscribe to our WhatsApp services.

{"originalurl":"https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/cambridge-analytica-facebook/","title":"How to stop Cambridge Analytica from abusing your Facebook data","text":["Apps connected to Facebook have long been a threat to users’ privacy, and the recent news about Cambridge Analytica is the very sort of danger that we’ve been warning people about for some time. Facebook has made a substantial effort to improve users’ privacy in terms of other Facebook users and non-Facebook users who might be Googling them, adding a long list of settings to its privacy menu.","However, apps connected to Facebook have their own privacy settings that aren’t covered in the obvious menus. Furthermore, while developers on Facebook’s platform are required to abide by strict data protection rules, it would appear that Facebook’s enforcement of those rules only extends to banishment after a violation has occurred. Facebook can do little to stop bad behavior until after the damage is done.","When you connect an app to Facebook, you are often required to give that app permissions to view information about your profile. This happens any time you log in with Facebook on another site, ranging from shopping sites like Amazon to tools, music and media streaming services, quizzes, surveys, and games. An app developer can request some 40 different permissions, all but three of which require review by Facebook staff before the app can be connected to the social network.","Those three “basic” permissions include a user’s friends lists, email address, and public profile info—what appears to non-Facebook friends who look at your account. In turn, the app developer can get their hands on the public profiles of everyone on the app user’s friends list. This is why even though only 270,000 people used the app to take a survey, the data of over 50 million users was accessed by Cambridge Analytics.","According to Facebook, basic profile information can include:","Name","Profile picture","Cover photo","Gender","School","Workplace","Username","User ID","Age","Language","Country","If you installed the app, the developer can access all of this information from everyone in your friends list without your friends’ consent. Similarly, if your friend connects an app to Facebook, that app can extract data from your profile without your knowledge or direct consent.","How to stop companies like Cambridge Analytica from accessing your account","Facebook users can and should take matters into their own hands. Short of deleting your account, you can disable the option to allow friends’ apps to glean information from your account. This setting is not in the Privacy menu as you might expect, but rather in the Apps menu—most people don’t look here, and Facebook never instructs users to do so in its “Privacy Checkups.” By disabling this feature, you can prevent companies like Cambridge Analytica from getting their hands on your data through friends’ apps.","If you believe your data has already been compromised, Facebook offers a little-known resource:","In Facebook’s Apps menu, click on an app and hit the Edit button.","Scroll down through the permissions (which you should also set to a minimum) to find your application ID.","Contact the developer, request your information be deleted, and give them the application ID so they know exactly what information to delete.","Whether a company like Cambridge Analytica would actually comply is questionable, though, and the company stated it already deleted Facebook user data from its servers.","Facebook users should also limit what information is available on their public profiles. Remove info like age, location, gender, school, and workplace.","Remove your Facebook profile from search results. Even if you block friends’ apps from accessing your profile, some information is publicly posted and can be found via other means such as Google. You can stop Google and other search engines from indexing your profile in the Privacy tab of Facebook’s settings menu.","Remove any apps you don’t use in the apps menu. For the apps you insist on keeping, limit their permissions to the minimum.","Facebook has several other privacy and security settings worth sifting through to limit access to your account by third parties. Follow along through this Facebook privacy checklist to make your account as secure as possible.","On a general note, be picky about what apps and services you connect to Facebook. Don’t be tempted by games, surveys, and quizzes that require a Facebook login. Once you connect an app to your profile, it remains there indefinitely until you remove it, and it can collect data about you the whole time. Haphazardly connecting apps not only puts your own data at risk but also your friends’ data.","Did Cambridge Analytica violate Facebook’s rules?","Facebook actually has quite strict rules for developers about how they use account data, and Facebook says Cambridge Analytica broke those rules. To Facebook’s credit, its platform policy states, “Only use friend data (including friends list) in the person’s experience in your app.” The platform asks developers to get user consent to use any Facebook data outside an app or in an ad.","Cambridge Analytica didn’t create the app. It was contracted out to a professor who built the app as a seemingly harmless survey. That professor then allegedly handed over the user data collected through the app to Cambridge Analytica. This would also appear to violate the social network’s platform policy:","“Protect the information you receive from us against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, don’t use data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for surveillance.”","Furthermore, the policy states:","“Don’t sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our services.”","Cambridge Analytica denies using Facebook data in its work for the Trump campaign and says it deleted the data after finding out it was obtained in violation of Facebook’s rules. A whistleblower who worked for the company, however, says the data formed a foundation for Cambridge Analytica’s work, and the data was not deleted as it should have been.","But more to the point, what enforcement mechanisms other than banishment after the fact does Facebook have to prevent such incidents from happening again? It would seem that Facebook can do little to stem abuse until after the damage has been done, despite its review process.","Isn’t basic profile info public?","Some onlookers have pointed out the information contained in public profiles is, well, public. Indeed, the information that Cambridge Analytica took via app users’ friends lists can often be found just by Googling a particular person’s profile.","In order to get 50 million users’ public profile data using publicly available channels, though, Cambridge Analytica would have had to use a scraper or some other form of automated data collection. This would violate Facebook’s terms of use, but again, Facebook has little means of enforcement until after the damage is done. Facebook does give users the option to stop search engines indexing their profiles and posting them in search results."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” the Observer quoted Wylie as saying.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the paper said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said on Friday it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent group Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared.","A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He added that “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement, which was attributed to the social network’s deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal.","FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is seen at the Facebook Gather conference in Brussels, Belgium January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook’s Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful,” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","‘MORE EVIDENCE’","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday.","In past interviews with Reuters, Parscale has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world’s largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, said in a Twitter post.","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and it is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica and two individuals going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan, the Cambridge University professor, lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data that he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information \"in a legitimate way\" but \"he did not subsequently abide by our rules\" when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir Eunoia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation in 2015, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted,” prompting the suspension announced on Friday.","Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom and Dustin Volz in Washington and Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by Jonathan Weber, Joseph Radford and Paul Simao"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law.

He went on to say that disruption doesn't have to be caused directly by the breach or attack but could be caused during the investigation process.","“I think it's fair and logical to say that the more often these breaches occur the more likely there will be an increase in patient mortality rates, as it's very likely that during a breach some sort of service disruption will occur and the doctor will be preoccupied and won't be giving full attention to a patient,” Lerman said.","Ultimately, Lerman said, it depends on if the breach or attack is visible to the doctors or not to understand the extent of the correlation of attacks."],"isopubdate":""}

The firms’ employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant.","Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London.","The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States — and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters’ behavior.","Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what — or which client — prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin’s popularity to Russian expansionism.","On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia. In both documents, the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients, with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm’s elections division. In a statement, SCL said an employee had done “commercial work” about 25 years ago “for a private company in Russia.”","Image","President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, left, meeting with Vagit Alekperov.

While Mr. Nix’s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference, Democrats on the committee want a fuller review. “It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica,” they said in a report this month.","Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm’s commercial division “discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.” The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.","Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.","“We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,” he wrote in response to a question from The Times. “Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.”","But Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company’s voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters.","“I remember being super confused,” said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.","“I kept asking Alexander, ‘Can you explain to me what they want?’” he said, referring to Mr. Nix. “I don’t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.”","“We’re sending them stuff about political targeting — they then come and ask more about political targeting,” Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil “just didn’t seem to be interested” in how the techniques could be used commercially.","Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.","A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie’s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.","Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, has met with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership.","Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Firm Aiding Trump Had a Link to Russia.

So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","(Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”)","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

At the time, apps could scrape data from both their users and the friends of those users, unless you had your privacy setting sufficiently locked down.","The company actually built an \"Anonymous Login\" tool that was specifically created so that Facebook users could log into third-party services without making all of their data available to developers.","But the once-hyped feature never launched. Facebook quietly killed the project, allegedly due to lack of interest.","That wasn't supposed to be the case, though. Anonymous Login was one of the first new features announced at Facebook's annual F8 developer conference in 2014, billed as part of a new effort to put \"people first.\"","\"We know that some people are scared of pressing this blue button,\" Zuckerberg said, referring to the now-ubiquitous \"login in with Facebook\" button. \"We don't ever want anyone to be surprised about how they're sharing on Facebook, that's not good for anyone.\"","The solution: an alternative Facebook login that would allow users to sign up to use an app without handing over personal data to the developer. Called Anonymous Login, the tool offered the same ease of use as the normal Facebook login, but Facebook would keep your identity anonymous to the developer.","Facebook's 'Anonymous Login' feature that never launched.","Image: facebook","\"The idea are is that even if you don't want an app to know who you are yet, you still want a streamlined experience of singing in,\" Zuckerberg said. \"This is going to let you try apps without fear.\"","But even though the feature was showcased prominently during Zuckerberg's keynote, it never launched. Not only that, Facebook barely mentioned it ever again.","The company confirmed that it officially killed the feature in August 2015, 16 months after the initial announcement, due to lack of interest from developers. As Recode reported that year, there was little incentive for developers to adopt the login feature.","Developers, much like Facebook, love data. The more they know about their users, the more effectively they can target them with ads, or figure out how to get them to spend more time in their apps. This is impossible to do without knowing their actual identity.","But it also seems that Facebook did very little to encourage developers to adopt the feature, either. It never launched more widely beyond the initial group of developers, for one. And, despite touting it as part of a new \"people first\" approach, the company didn't seem to care much at the end of they day whether it was actually used.","To be clear, Anonymous Login couldn't have prevented the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. By all accounts, the data in question had already been obtained by the time Facebook introduced the feature.","But it's an idea that's worth revisiting knowing now what we should have known then about the consequences of handing over all our data to Facebook's developers so willingly. At a time when distrust of Facebook, and the services that plug into it, is at an all-time high, having a feature like Anonymous Login could help users feel like they have some semblance of control over their data.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The New York Times reported that at least some of the data is still available on the internet.","Cambridge Analytica has denied inappropriate use of Facebook user profiles, but a former employee who is now a whistleblower has emphatically contradicted that claim.","Facebook now has 2.1bn active users, 1.4bn of whom use the site every day. As a social networking platform, it enables people to share ideas, photos and life events with friends, which collectively gives Facebook the highest-resolution image of every user of any media company, with an emphasis on emotions.","For advertisers, Facebook is exceptional for its ability to target more than half of all the people in every developed market and the power it gives to advertisers. On Facebook, advertisers can buy the equivalent of the Super Bowl audience – or any other audience – any day of the year.","Five years ago, researchers hypothesized that Facebook algorithms could be used to predict things like product and political preferences from just a handful of “likes”. Those researchers were concerned about the privacy implications, in part because the default Facebook setting for likes was “public”.","Cambridge Analytica thought it could transform US politics by exploiting that insight.","It was not just the user's profile data that was harvested, but also that of their friends, none of whom were notified","With the 2016 election cycle fast approaching, Cambridge Analytica did not have time to create its own custom profiles. So it went to researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who created a Facebook app that paid users to take a personality test.","There were problems with this arrangement. First, Kogan did not have permission from Facebook to use the data he gathered for commercial purposes, which best characterizes his Cambridge Analytica relationship. Second, the app not only harvested user profile data – which could be compared with the results of the personality test – but also the user profile data of each test taker’s friends, none of whom were notified.","Was any of this illegal? Facebook may be liable for a data breach, which may create legal problems under state law. The attorney general of Massachusetts has announced an investigation. Cambridge Analytica may face charges that it broke US election laws by employing people who were neither US citizens nor green card holders on a US presidential election campaign. Both may be subject to action by the FTC. Or perhaps not.","We live in a world of big data, where companies get rich off our personal information with few constraints and almost no supervision. Companies offer us free applications that are convenient, useful and fun in exchange for perpetual rights to the data they can harvest from our actions online (and sometimes offline).","The big data companies are opaque to consumers and regulators alike, so few people understand the risks and companies can often hide data breaches for a long time. US law provides very little privacy protection, leaving consumers with little or no recourse when they are harmed.","It is past time that the US recognize that data is too important to be unregulated. Equifax has yet to face significant consequences, despite losing control of the financial data of most adult Americans. Is that appropriate? Will Facebook face consequences for the data it lost to Cambridge Analytica? Will Cambridge Analytica or the Trump campaign be held to account?","Roger McNamee was an early investor in Facebook and a mentor to founder Mark Zuckerberg.

Politicians are demanding that the Facebook co-founder and CEO testify to Congress in the wake of the social network's scandal involving a data firm affiliated with the Donald Trump campaign.","Facebook disclosed late Friday that researchers from UK-based Cambridge Analytica had duped the social networking giant and gained access to data from more than 50 million Facebook users through an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" which was then used for political ads during the 2016 presidential election.","Now playing:Watch this:\nDid Facebook lose control of your information?","3:28","Facebook said in a statement Friday that it had banned the group, but the political pressure on the massive social network is just beginning. By Monday morning, multiple senators were demanding that Zuckerberg testify before Congress.","An appearance from Zuckerberg could potentially offer answers at a time when Facebook has gotten into hot water over its involvement with the distribution of Russia-made ads and posts on its network. But it's unclear whether it'll happen.","'They need to take responsibility'","But the call for Facebook's CEO continues to rise. On Saturday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar tweeted that \"Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary.\"","The Minnesota Democrat added to her demand on Monday morning, telling NPR's Morning Edition that Zuckerberg needs to speak for Facebook's flaws.","\"They have not come before us, they've given it to their lobbyists and their lawyers, and we think that they need to take responsibility for what's going on,\" Klobuchar said. \"I don't know why this CEO, even though he's super famous and has made a lot of money, why he also doesn't have to come before the committee.\"","She pointed out that multiple CEOs have testified to Congress in the past, and said the chances of Zuckerberg appearing increase if more politicians call for it.","Responding to a request for comment, Facebook didn't address whether Zuckerberg would be willing to testify before Congress.","\"We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,\" said Paul Grewal, Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel. \"That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.\"","Klobuchar isn't the only one speaking out.

Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, made a similar request on Thursday, before news of the scandal came out. The vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee told Bloomberg \"the CEOs owe an obligation.\"","Weaponizing psychological profiles","On Tuesday, Warner formally addressed Zuckerberg, writing that Facebook owes the public an explanation.","\"It's time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other CEOs to testify before Congress. The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election,\" Warner said in a tweet.","Cambridge Analytica released a statement Monday morning calling the claims against its company \"false allegations.\"","On Monday, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), wrote a letter to Zuckerberg, asking for the CEO to explain how Facebook's data was abused by Cambridge Analytica.","\"With little oversight -- and no meaningful intervention from Facebook -- Cambridge Analytica was able to use Facebook-developed and marketed tools to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans,\" Wyden wrote in his letter.","Several senators have added their requests for Zuckerberg to head to Washington, DC, including Sen.

Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.","Cambridge Analytica boasts of dirty tricks to swing elections","Read more","The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analyticato determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.","The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.","The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.","On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.","“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.","The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election.

It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.","Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.","Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.","Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.","Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change.

I became fully aware of Trump's business practices in 1992. I had read earlier stories about Trump by then but once I got involved in the construction documentation business, I learned far more. A lot of other people did before then. My friends ask where is definitive proof?","“J. Michael Diehl, who owns Freehold Music Center, sold Trump eight Yamaha grand pianos for around $100,000. “He put out a bid for pianos about a year before the Taj opened. I won the bid. I delivered the pianos, and I waited and I waited to get paid.

Mr. Jacobson, whose last name was spelled Jacobsen in the lawsuit, denied the claim.","Court records show the suit was dropped in 2006 after a planned mediation. Ms. Jacobson said Mr. Jacobson agreed not to be paid in full rather than accumulate legal fees. A review of Palm Beach County court records showed no other payment disputes involving Classic Chandeliers. The shop later closed. Mr. Jacobson died in 2015.","Mr. Trump said of Mr. Jacobson: “He was terrible, that guy…He didn’t do the job properly.”","But some other were happy, “A onetime competitor of Mr. Jacobson’s, owner Jack Shea of Reward Lighting said he had a “fabulous relationship” with Mr. Trump, to whom he said he sold chandeliers without payment problems.

The contractor who put in the bathroom partitions had to lay off his brother.","\"Anytime I went to Atlantic City and I'd see that Trump sign, I'd think of the little guys,\" says bankruptcy lawyer Arthur Abramowitz who worked with contractors for years after the casino itself went bankrupt. \"It wasn't just the money; a lot of these guys went into depression.\"","Of all the real estate and casino deals in Trump's long career, the Taj arguably sheds the most light on how the would-be U.S. president handles crises. It was his biggest gamble, the \"eighth wonder of the world,\" as he dubbed it. And when it went south, his moves to avoid a financial hit to his empire hobbled many small businesses with little cushion to absorb the blow.","After the Taj opened in April 1990, the self-anointed \"King of Debt\" owed $70 million to 253 contractors employing thousands who built the domes and minarets, put up the glass and drywall, laid the pipes and installed everything from chandeliers to bathroom fixtures. A year later, when the casino collapsed into bankruptcy, those owed the most got only 33 cents in cash for each dollar owed, with promises of another 50 cents later. It took years to get the rest, assuming the companies survived long enough to collect.”","Another vendor had a problem:","“Five hundred miles away, in Ashtabula, Ohio, Robert Morrison of the Molded Fiber Glass Co. was pressing his workers to finish the domes and minarets and other faux Moorish ornaments in time for the April opening — and worrying about who was going to pay for all of it. An invoice sent a few weeks earlier for $1.4 million still hadn't been paid.","Many contractors didn't know what to think. Trump was denying he was in financial trouble: \"I have a tremendous amount of cash,\" he told the Washington Post that March. Far from being overstretched, he told Newsweek, he was looking to expand: \"I think the people with a lot of cash —and I have a lot of cash — are going to be able to make beautiful deals in the next few years.\"","\"Naturally, you assumed you'd get paid,\" Molded Fiber Glass CEO Morrison wrote in a book about the Taj published in 1994. \"Donald Trump was flamboyant, but he was an immensely successful contractor who paid his debts.\"","One of the reasons some contractors heard for the delay in pay: Trump said he needed to complete audits first to make sure they weren't overcharging. Trump had a reputation as a relentless haggler with contractors, always suspecting that they were cheating him.","\"You have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors,\" he wrote in his 1987 book, \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" ''or they'll take the shirt right off your back.\"","The delays meant that contractors had to keep reaching into their pockets to pay their workers and suppliers. Some couldn't afford the negative cash flow, and the money squeeze started rippling out from company to company.”","This was in the news in 1990:","A TERRIBLE BLOW","In August 1990, the truth finally came out.","Over his protests, regulators unsealed a devastating report written by Trump's own accountants: The \"billionaire\" had been burning through cash in his personal accounts so fast in the spring that he would have had nothing by end of the year if he didn't take drastic action. If he had to sell everything quickly, according to accountants Kenneth Leventhal & Co., he'd be worth as little as negative $295 million.","A pattern starts, “Family trees: That combativeness applies to anyone, anywhere. At Trump Tower he told Irving Fischer, chairman of HRH Construction Corp., for years the Trump family’s main contractor, to get rid of a bunch of trees that had been installed in the building’s lobby. It had been an ordeal getting the tall trees into the building to begin with, and Fischer was unclear as to how Trump thought they could get them out. “Ever hear of a chain saw?” he snapped. It cost Trump $100,000 more, but he got rid of the trees he didn’t want.","Does toughness necessarily translate into more money for Trump? Ask Eric Silverstein. His sign-painting company had been working overtime to get ready for the opening of Trump Plaza, one of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos. Silverstein was a minor contractor on a huge project. But for him, the $800,000 fee was enormous.","No choice: Trump kept asking for small improvements in his work, Silverstein says, and delayed payment until they were completed. Then, he claims, Robert Trump, who managed the project for Donald, called Silverstein to a meeting he swears took place in one of the hotel’s men’s rooms. Trump, Silverstein says, had a new offer. He would give him 50 cents on the dollar to settle the contact. If he didn’t like it, he claims he was told, he could sue. Silverstein says he had little choice. A suit would take years, and he simply couldn’t afford the legal fees.","Robert Trump says Silverstein’s company got paid less than what he contracted for because it did “shoddy work and was late in finishing it, besides.” Silverstein disputes those claims, but Robert Trump says “Anything he got paid was too much.” Donald says he is unaware of the incident, but adds, “If a contractor does a great job, he gets full payment on the first of every month. Sometimes even earlier. If a contactor does less of a good job, I will try to renegotiate. If a contractor has done a bad job he will go through hell.”","In June, in some remarkable intellectual contortionism, Donald Trump tweeted: “I never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage—smart!”","Trump, the man, never did go bankrupt.","But the Trump casinos did, cyclically, and with disturbing regularity. “Serial filers,” Fitch Ratings called them.","Still, last summer, about a month before Trump Plaza closed, and with its sister property, Trump Taj Mahal, teetering on the brink of closure, where it remains, Trump said he “did great with Atlantic City.”","An inveterate image-burnisher, he pitches the four bankruptcies — in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009 — as markers of commercial prowess; just a “smart!” scrappy businessman playing hardball with mercenary lenders to restructure debt on favorable terms.","“These lenders aren’t babies,” Trump said in Thursday night’s Republican presidential debate. “These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people you think.”","But the bankruptcies — starting with Trump Taj Mahal, which bankrupted about a year after Trump opened it using $675 million in patently unsustainable junk bonds — were less displays of cool resourcefulness than frantic episodes of Trump scrambling to bail on bank debt and keep his perennially overleveraged casinos from going belly up.","“The project was dangerous in the beginning,” said Bryant Simon, a historian and Temple University professor who authored “Boardwalk of Dreams: Atlantic City and the Fate of Urban America.”","“A lot of people got stuck holding the bag, and he didn’t. So people resented him for that and felt serious financial pain.”","And it wasn’t just faceless bankers who got burned in the bankruptcies.","In the 2009 case, unsecured creditors — low-level investors, contractors, small-time vendors — got less than a penny on the dollar for their claims against Trump Entertainment Resorts (Trump resigned as chairman four days before the bankruptcy filing).","“He defaulted, and he walked away,” said Harry Smith, 87, a retired trial attorney formerly of Manasquan, Monmouth County, currently living in Jupiter, Florida. Smith saw about $91,000 evaporate from his retirement account when his investment in Trump bonds soured.","“Three former members, all of whom quit in August, told me that as early as April they were promised financial compensation but were later told that they would have to work as volunteers. They say the leaders of the shop, Rick Dearborn and John Mashburn, told many staffers that money was on the way but then were unable to deliver.”"],"isopubdate":""}

The team designed single-rack and multi-rack versions of the assembly, with four cabling configurations.","The Facebook Fabric Aggregator was created as a way to manage traffic for data-intensive applications including artificial intelligence and machine learning, and has been in use at Facebook for approximately nine months. Sree Sankar, technical product manager for Facebook, said that over a year ago, the company realized that it was rapidly running out of capacity, and that a scaling solution would require a 300% increase in ports. A straight capacity increase solution was unworkable due to the need for greater energy efficiency.","Ms. Sankar noted that while data processing occurs throughout the network, most of the workload was handled in the data centre. And the interaction between compute and servers, and multiple buildings in a region, required “a fabric aggregation layer, comprised of several aggregation nodes.”","The Fabric Aggregator provides for scalable aggregation-layer capacity that improves energy efficiency and network resiliency. It uses the Wedge100S switches as building blocks, in a two-layer cross-connect architecture. Downstream traffic is moved within a region; upstream traffic moves between regions, and the two types of traffic move on two different aggregation layers. This way, subswitches can be added or removed as traffic patterns change, providing for a flexible, scalable data interconnect solution.","The Wedge100S switches operate using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) between subswitches, allowing for a distributed design without the need for a central controller. Subswitches are independent, and can be added or removed without affecting the viability of the system overall; subswitches are interchangeable between upstream and downstream traffic, and the system is redundant so that several nodes can be removed at once without affecting overall network performance."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows.

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information - including the names of users, their \"likes,\" friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook is suspending the Trump -affiliated data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, after learning that it failed to delete data that it had taken inappropriately from users of the social network, Facebook said late Friday.","Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication...","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work - including a former Cambridge Analytica employee - said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what \"like\" buttons they had hit.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook's concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump's digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook's public website.","Some critics said Facebook's actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Cambridge Analytica - which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president's former senior adviser Stephen Bannon - has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its \"psychometric profiles\" could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company's actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, D, said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data \"may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. \"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 EU referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook's processes for dealing with developers who broke the company's rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules - usually because of a story in the news - the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook \"relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,\" Parakilas said. \"During my 16 months at the company, I don't recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.\"","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","\"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook's actions on Saturday, including if they ran afoul of their 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of their agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry in to U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge's \"psychographic targeting\" techniques - including its use of Facebook data - with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of the Cambridge work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge's work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm's data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign's data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump's strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge's parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in \"soft power,\" or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia's influence in the region.","SCL's main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience's values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of \"persuadables,\" and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL's defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company's techniques is that it \"can be undertaken covertly.\"","\"Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government's role and/or third parties can be invisible,\" he wrote."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

This is sufficient for my purposes, but I like the containerization approach in general – I’d love it if I could tell my browser to do this for every site I visit.","Oh, this is neat. I’ve been using uBlock Origin in medium mode to keep various identity providers from tracking me across the web, which I think (mostly?) accomplishes that goal. But it takes sufficient work to unbreak websites that it’s not something I could recommend to non-techie friends/relatives. Seems that First Party Isolation might be though?","This is cool, AFAICT it’s basically their existing container-tab feature (which requires no extension), and the only difference is that it automates the creation of a container for Facebook, so that whenever you load Facebook it loads in the Facebook container tab.","This is great, but even better is this amazing extension called “not using Facebook”.","Its a real shame some of us have close friends and family who don’t care about digital privacy and use Facebook to communicate. The container is a great idea (and good on Mozilla for putting it together!) So not all of us can use the ‘not using Facebook’ extension. ¯_(ツ)_/¯","I’m sure you do have plenty of friends that don’t mind communicating that way. I do not. I do use signal as my primary SMS driver however and am a big fan. My point is that dropping FB as a communications tool is a case by case study. I don’t think I can’t convince moms to use something else to video call me while she’s already on FB talking to her quilting friends.","I’ve quit facebook more than 5 years ago, and I’ve tried ever since to convince others to do so as well, but to paint it as anything simple is ignorance of how deep its roots now run in a lot of communities. Even I still rely on facebook indirectly to find out about events through friends who are still on facebook. I’ve also lost contact with a lot of old friends, and while I see that as no problem, since the friendships that mattered to me still persisted, I can’t ask others to accept the same. With no clear alternative in sight, asking people to quit facebook is akin to asking people decades ago to get rid of their landlines. You’ll need more than “facebook is watching you”.","This is very true. If Facebook was just a creepy surveillance system designed to sell you ads, no-one would use it. For many people, Facebook provides value - connections with friends and family, the ability to communicate over vast distances, a place where you can, in some ways, curate your own personality. The problem is that FB offers this seemingly for free, while hiding the actual cost from its users.","I’ve done so and, tbh, I completely isolated myself from many friends. Not that I don’t speak to/see them, but that I miss lots of spontaneous opportunities. Like a picture with a drink saying “come grab a drink if you’re nearby”, that I don’t see anymore, or just basic events that I don’t receive anymore and is a pain to forward/update to people that are not on FB…","Really? I find it rather overrated. The rank grind’s mostly terrible, most of the map is just empty water and the graphics leave a lot to be desired (I think charging for the HD contact lens upgrade in-game while immersive is a very EA-style move).","Also the big event storylines are a bit far-fetched. I mean, putting a bright orange idiot in as president? Come on.","I think it is very good that they are working on coming up to new solutions to avoid digital surveillance. But I remember reading that they already get the identity of logged out users using fingerprints like battery life. Using the techniques like the aforementioned one they could tie the two ‘browsing contexts’ together.","This is very true.

But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.","[Update, March 25, 2018, 20:24 Eastern Time]: Facebook has responded to this and other reports regarding the collection of call and SMS data with a blog post that denies Facebook collected call data surreptitiously. The company also writes that it never sells the data and that users are in control of the data uploaded to Facebook. This \"fact check\" contradicts several details Ars found in analysis of Facebook data downloads and testimony from users who provided the data. More on the Facebook response is appended to the end of the original article below.","This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years' worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.","This experience has been shared by a number of other Facebook users who spoke with Ars, as well as independently by us—my own Facebook data archive, I found, contained call-log data for a certain Android device I used in 2015 and 2016, along with SMS and MMS message metadata.","Calls I made to my office number to check my voicemail, and from my office number to find my phone, found in my Facebook data archive. In total, there were two years of call data, from the period I used my Blackphone as my primary phone.","To retrieve a .zip file of your Facebook data, go to the Settings page on Facebook and click the link circled in this screen shot.","In response to an email inquiry by Ars about this data gathering, a Facebook spokesperson replied, \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","The spokesperson pointed out that contact uploading is optional and installation of the application explicitly requests permission to access contacts. And users can delete contact data from their profiles using a tool accessible via Web browser.","Further Reading","Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past. (For Facebook's instructions on turning off continuous contact uploading, go here. )","If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. From Android 4.1 on, a single request from those applications would trigger two separate permission requests.","But until the \"Marshmallow\" version of Android, even with split permissions, all permissions could still be presented all at once, without users getting the option to decline them individually. So Facebook and other applications could continue to gain access to call and SMS data with a single request by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Starting with Marshmallow, users could toggle these permissions separately themselves. But as many as half of Android users worldwide remain on older versions of the operating system because of carrier restrictions on updates or other issues.","Apple iOS has never allowed access to call log data by third-party apps, overt or silently, so this sort of data acquisition was never possible.","Facebook provides a way for users to purge collected contact data from their accounts, but it's not clear if this deletes just contacts or if it also purges call and SMS metadata. After purging my contact data, my contacts and calls were still in the archive I downloaded the next day—likely because the archive was not regenerated for my new request. (Update: The cached archive was generated once and not updated on the second request. However, two days after a request to delete all contact data, the contacts were still listed by the contact management tool.)","As always, if you're really concerned about privacy, you should not share address book and call-log data with any mobile application. And you may want to examine the rest of what can be found in the downloadable Facebook archive, as it includes all the advertisers that Facebook has shared your contact information with, among other things.","Update, March 25, 2018, continued:","Facebook responded to reports that it collected phone and SMS data without users' knowledge in a \"fact check\" blog post on Sunday. In the response, a Facebook spokesperson stated:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","This contradicts the experience of several users who shared their data with Ars. Dylan McKay told Ars that he installed Messenger in 2015, but only allowed the app the permissions in the Android manifest that were required for installation. He says he removed and reinistalled the app several times over the course of the next few years, but never explicitly gave the app permission to read his SMS records and call history. McKay's call and SMS data runs through July of 2017.","In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used. Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.","While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data.","Facebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \"help friends find each other\" after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \"opt-in\" for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \"OK\" button to approve \"keeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\"","Facebook says that the company keeps the data secure and does not sell it to third parties. But the post doesn't address why it would be necessary to retain not just the numbers of contacts from phone calls and SMS messages, but the date, time, and length of those calls for years.","Sean Gallagher\nSean is Ars Technica's IT and National Security Editor.

Strictly from a communications standpoint, it has all the retro appeal of Mr. Zuckerberg announcing that he is embarking on an apology tour traveling by horse-drawn carriage and clad in a top-hat and suspenders rather than his customary hoodie.","It was, however, a way to pay some money to the publications that have been hammering him with how-to articles advising readers on the steps to take to delete their accounts.","If the newspaper owners have their way, the funds from Facebook wont be a one-shot payment, but just the beginning of a never-ending cash-flow akin to the lucrative carriage fees that cable companies pay networks for content.","There are at least two different narratives into which the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal neatly fits.","The first, Trump stole the election, matches a familiar pattern with a long history in American politics, from Republican complaints about the 1960 Kennedy campaign in Chicago and Texas on through the hanging chads of Florida and the Supreme Courts 2000 decision in Bush v. Gore.","The second story is that of the legacy news organizations, such as print newspapers, blaming the decline of their businesses on big technology companies like Google and Facebook. The newspapers have gone so far as asking Congress for an antitrust exemption to help them demand money from Google and Facebook for the privilege of providing hyperlinks to their stories.","Its not only advertising revenue that the newspapers have lost, though they have lost that, by the billions of dollars. Its the agenda-setting power. Newspaper editors once had the power to decide what was front-page news, and what wasnt news at all. Now that power lies instead with the algorithms of Facebook and Twitter and the decisions of aggregators ranging from online powerhouses such as Matt Drudge and Glenn Reynolds to all those distant family members, college classmates, or former co-workers who regularly post to Facebook or email out news articles and opinion pieces.","Questioning the motives of Facebook  all Zuckerberg really cares about is making money  or the integrity of its business practices  they dont care about keeping your personal data private  is, for newspapers, a fantasy pathway for a restoration to the central role they once played in information-filtering for American citizens.","This is a somewhat new dynamic.","The Washington shakedown  in which politicians of both parties haul executives of a successful company in for hearings, threaten a regulatory crackdown or investigation, and then retreat after the company hires enough former staffers as lobbyists, makes enough campaign contributions, or otherwise pays homage  is an old and familiar story. Theres some of that in the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica tale, too.","The print newspaper publisher shakedown  in which the legacy press assails a successful Internet company until the Internet company agrees to pay the press lots of money  is a newer tale.","How will it end?","A clue may be in the case of one newspaper that has been relatively more restrained than others in pressing the case against Facebook  the Washington Post. It ran Donald E. Grahams shrewd op-ed headlined Dont Regulate Facebook, along with an editorial advising readers to take a deep breath and avoid rushing to judgment about the disclosures. The Post is now owned by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who, as a disruptive technology innovator, has a lot in common with Mark Zuckerberg.","Maybe Mr. Zuckerbergs route out of this one involves not signing up to pay billions of dollars in carriage fees to newspaper publishers but rather making like Mr. Bezos did, and personally purchasing one. Mr. Zuckerbergs net wealth is down about $7.5 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, but with $65 billion, he could still easily afford to purchase the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times or Gannett or Tronc. The price would be more than those full-page newspaper ads. Whether it would be worth the investment would require some business analysis about how much of that $7.5 billion decline in Mr. Zuckerbergs wealth stems from negative press coverage.","One thing is for sure: if Mr. Zuckerberg does buy a newspaper, it wont be publishing articles telling readers how to delete their Facebook accounts.

Campaign officials say they kept the data secure and did not sell or give it to third parties, although there have been some allegations that Facebook released at least some of that data anyway, without permission.","Cambridge, by comparison, has been accused of violating Facebook rules. The firm has suspended CEO Alexander Nix, pending an investigation.","Nix, you may recall, unintentionally added juice to this story by getting caught in an undercover sting video conducted against Cambridge Analytica by Britain’s Channel 4.

They have accused the company of contributing to Trump’s victory by failing to rein in fake news and Russian propaganda. The latest scandal has brought new calls for Zuckerberg to testify before Congress and clarify how customer data is being used and possibly misused.","On Wednesday, after remaining conspicuously silent since Friday night, Zuckerberg promised to restrict third-party access to Facebook data in an effort to win back user trust. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” he wrote on Facebook.","Well said, but we’ve heard such earnest mea culpas from Zuckerberg before. Fast Company has compiled a list of almost a dozen other apologies Zuck has issued since 2003. “Like any habitual sinner,” opines Politico’s media columnist Jack Shafer, “he sins, seeks forgiveness in confession, and then with that naughty boy expression pasted on his face, he goes forth and sins again.”","Will he get away with it again? We’ve seen this dance before. Everybody hates Zuckerberg, yet we also love what his company has brought to us. Like a lot of tech wizards or major corporate CEOs, he likes to push the limits and worry about apologies later.","Perhaps this time, we the public will push back hard enough to rein in Facebook’s seductive power with appropriate regulations, beginning with the requirement that they get our permission before collecting and sharing our data with third parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

McGahn II, should issue a statement denying a New York Times article in January. The article said Mr. McGahn told investigators that the president once asked him to fire the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. McGahn never released a statement and later had to remind the president that he had indeed asked Mr. McGahn to see that Mr. Mueller was dismissed, the people said.","In the other episode, Mr. Trump asked his former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, how his interview had gone with the special counsel’s investigators and whether they had been “nice,” according to two people familiar with the discussion.","The episodes demonstrate that even as the special counsel investigation appears to be intensifying, the president has ignored his lawyers’ advice to avoid doing anything publicly or privately that could create the appearance of interfering with it.","The White House did not respond to several requests for comment. Mr. Priebus and Mr. McGahn declined to comment through their lawyer, William A. Burck.","Image","Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s first chief of staff, left the White House in July 2017.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times","Legal experts said Mr. Trump’s contact with the men most likely did not rise to the level of witness tampering. But witnesses and lawyers who learned about the conversations viewed them as potentially a problem and shared them with Mr. Mueller.","In investigating Russian election interference, Mr. Mueller is also examining whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry. The former F.B.I. director James B. Comey said that Mr. Trump asked him for his loyalty and to end the investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. After firing Mr. Comey, the president said privately that the dismissal had relieved “great pressure” on him. And Mr. Trump also told White House officials after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation that he needed someone running the Justice Department who would protect him.","The experts said the meetings with Mr. McGahn and Mr. Priebus would probably sharpen Mr. Mueller’s focus on the president’s interactions with other witnesses. The special counsel has questioned witnesses recently about their interactions with the president since the investigation began. The experts also said the episodes could serve as evidence for Mr. Mueller in an obstruction case.","“It makes it look like you’re cooking a story, and prosecutors are always looking out for it,” said Julie R. O’Sullivan, a law professor at Georgetown University and expert on white-collar criminal investigations.","She added, “It can get at the issue of consciousness of guilt in an obstruction case because if you didn’t do anything wrong, why are you doing that?”","Central figures in investigations are almost always advised by their own lawyers to keep from speaking with witnesses and prosecutors to prevent accusations of witness tampering. The president has not been questioned by Mr. Mueller; Mr. Trump’s lawyers are negotiating terms of a possible interview. Learning even basic details about what other witnesses told investigators could help the president shape his own answers.","Mr. Trump’s interactions with Mr. McGahn unfolded in the days after the Jan. 25 Times article, which said that Mr. McGahn threatened to quit last June after the president asked him to fire the special counsel. After the article was published, the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, told Mr. McGahn that the president wanted him to release a statement saying that the story was not true, the people said.","Mr. Porter, who resigned last month amid a domestic abuse scandal, told Mr. McGahn the president had suggested he might “get rid of” Mr. McGahn if he chose not to challenge the article, the people briefed on the conversation said.","Mr. McGahn did not publicly deny the article, and the president later confronted him in the Oval Office in front of the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, according to the people.","The president said he had never ordered Mr. McGahn to fire the special counsel. Mr. McGahn replied that the president was wrong and that he had in fact asked Mr. McGahn in June to call the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to tell him that the special counsel had a series of conflicts that disqualified him for overseeing the investigation and that he had to be dismissed. The president told Mr. McGahn that he did not remember the discussion that way.","Image","Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, refused the president’s request to deny a New York Times article saying that Mr. Trump ordered him to fire the special counsel.CreditPete Marovich for The New York Times","Mr. Trump moved on, pointing out that Mr. McGahn had never told him that he was going to resign over the order to fire the special counsel. Mr. McGahn acknowledged that that was true but said that he had told senior White House officials at the time that he was going to quit.","It is not clear how the confrontation was resolved. Mr. McGahn has stayed on as White House counsel, one of the few senior administration officials who has been with the president since the campaign.","Mr. Priebus met with the president in the West Wing in December, according to the people with knowledge of their encounter. Allies of Mr. Priebus, who left the White House in July 2017, have cautioned him to keep his distance. But Mr. Priebus, who is seeking to build a law practice as a Washington power broker who can open doors for clients, has maintained contact and occasionally visited the White House to see Mr. Trump and his own replacement, Mr. Kelly.","Mr. Trump brought up Mr. Priebus’s October interview with the special counsel’s office, the people said, and Mr. Priebus replied that the investigators were courteous and professional. He shared no specifics and did not say what he had told investigators, and the conversation moved on after a few minutes, those briefed on it said. Mr. Kelly was present for that conversation as well, and it was not clear whether he tried to stop the discussion.","It is not illegal for the subject of an investigation to learn what witnesses have told investigators. But that is usually done through lawyers for the people involved because their communications are often shielded from prosecutors because of attorney-client privilege. In organized crime and complex white-collar investigations, prosecutors often ask witnesses whether they have spoken to the person under investigation to determine whether they are coordinating their stories.","Mr. Priebus has had a long and complicated relationship with the president. He was one of the few who publicly defended Mr. Trump after the Times article about his attempt to fire Mr. Mueller, which cited the president’s view that Mr. Mueller had too many conflicts to be the special counsel.","“He expresses concerns with the conflicts, but I never heard the idea or the concept that this person needed to be fired,” Mr. Priebus said last month in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I never felt it was relayed to me that way, either. And I would know the difference between a level 10 situation as reported in that story and what was reality. And it just — to me, it wasn’t reality.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: Potential Complications in Asking Witnesses if They Had Been ‘Nice’.

And on a recent post-crisis media blitz, founder Mark Zuckerberg has emphasized that the mass exfiltration of scads of profiles from unsuspecting Facebook users was a vestige of a past privacy practice, not a symptom of anything wrong with current Facebook policy.","Yet Facebook urged Congress to pass a measure, the CLOUD Act, that privacy advocates warn makes it easier for a foreign government to acquire Americans’ emails, pics, videos and other online data, and then share that with U.S. law enforcement. It also makes it easier for those foreign governments to get the online lives of their own citizens from the servers of companies like Facebook.","Congress tucked the CLOUD Act into its omnibus spending bill – the measure it passed in the wee hours of Friday morning to avert a government shutdown. President Trump, after vacillating, signed it into law today.","“Despite Facebook's promise to take Americans' personal privacy seriously, it and other big tech companies championed a bill that will let foreign governments directly demand emails and other personal information from those under protection of U.S. law, all without oversight from U.S. courts,” Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee, told The Daily Beast on Friday.","\"Congress has delivered a huge giveaway to big tech companies, at the expense of Americans' rights. Without one minute of debate, the CLOUD Act was jammed into a must-pass bill to satisfy tech giants.”","The CLOUD Act requires telecoms, internet service providers and tech firms to “preserve, backup or disclose the contents of a wire or communication and any record or other information pertaining to a customer or subscriber within such a provider’s possession, custody or control.”","Then come the parts that a consortium of tech firms are particularly eager to see enacted.","“Congress has delivered a huge giveaway to big tech companies, at the expense of Americans' rights.”","— Senator Ron Wyden","Such disclosure, the measure mandates, shall occur “regardless of whether such communication, record or other information is located within or outside the United States.” And it changes existing law to stipulate that it “shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a provider of electronic communication service to the public or a remote computing service” – that is, a cloud-based data storage business, hence the name of the act – “to intercept or disclose the contents of a wire or electronic communication in response to an order from a foreign government that is subject to an executive agreement” certified by the attorney general.","In other words, foreign governments now have a warrant-free path to huge amounts of digital data, including those stored on U.S.-based servers – something civil libertarians warn will have severe implications for both Americans and foreigners.","Privacy advocates call the new law an end run around the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Under the CLOUD Act, U.S. law enforcement can “grab data stored anywhere in the world, without following foreign data privacy rules,” assessed the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And the U.S.’ foreign partners can set up a Fourth Amendment shell game. Those foreign governments can access Americans’ online communications with foreigners, and if what they find “relates to significant harm, or the threat thereof, to the United States or United States persons,” they can pass it back to the feds. No warrant required.","And the part about “executive agreements” represents a major threat to users of services like Facebook in authoritarian countries. The Trump administration and its successors could enter into a handshake deal with foreign governments to turn over data on citizens of those governments targeted for retribution for protesting, organizing or other activity displeasing to tyrants that are stored on the U.S. servers of Facebook, Google or other tech giants. And then, per the language of the law, the tech giants will be compelled to comply.","The measure “allows Trump, and any future president, to share Americans' private emails and other information with countries he personally likes. That means he can strike deals with Russia or Turkey with nearly zero congressional involvement and no oversight by U.S. courts,” Wyden warned in a Thursday statement ahead of the vote on the omnibus.","The tech companies favor the CLOUD Act because it would “reduce international conflicts of law,” a group of them wrote to leading senators on February 6. That’s a reference to various countries’ divergent laws and privacy protections over law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ access to domestic and foreign-stored data. While the group framed their support in terms of “enhancing and protecting individual privacy rights,” their letter conspicuously referred to permutations of that “reducing conflicts of law” phrase four times in five paragraphs.","The rights protections those tech firms lauded in their letter are, in Wyden’s Thursday assessment, “toothless provisions on human rights that Trump’s cronies can meet by merely checking a box.”","Signatories to the pro-CLOUD Act letter are Apple, Google, Verizon-owned Oath – which in turn owns Yahoo, Tumblr and AOL – and Facebook.","Zuckerberg emerged Wednesday night after days of deafening silence over the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The Observer and the New York Times had revealed that an app downloaded by 275,000 people and designed by a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan had scraped up Facebook profiles for an unsuspecting 50 million people who hadn’t read the fine print of their user agreements and privacy settings. Kogan provided the Trump-connected firm Cambridge Analytica with the data, in violation of Facebook’s then-current policies – but Facebook simply took the firm at its word that the data was deleted.","“You know we have a basic responsibility to protect people's data and if we can't do that then we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people,” Zuckerberg told CNN.","But there was “good news,” he told Recode. “Actually the most important changes to the platform we made in 2014, three or four years ago, to restrict apps like [Kogan’s] from being able to access a person’s ‘friends’ data in addition to theirs.”","Asked by The Daily Beast to reconcile Zuckerberg’s recent data-protection assurances with the CLOUD Act, Facebook has yet to provide an answer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

Sounds like an exotic and colourful member of the parrot species, but it's a bird of prey.","Its activities have not yet achieved the attention they deserve because, when one says \"politicians' entitlements\" and \"political funding disclosure\" in the same sentence, the national eyes glaze over.","Well, sit up and take a bit of notice, because the manner in which Parakeelia has buried its beak in the national feed tray is, once the legal chicanery is stripped away, as brutally simple as laundering drug money through a casino. Our taxes are funding the Liberal Party, in large sums and without our informed consent.","...together with equipment, facilities, office requisites and stationery necessary to operate the office, as approved by the Minister, for purposes related to Parliamentary, electorate or official business, but not commercial business.","With me so far? MPs are entitled to this money to pay for software necessary to run their electorate offices. The Liberals all choose to spend it on Parakeelia's software and associated support services (training, helpdesk). Assuming the software's use meets the definition of \"Parliamentary, electorate or official business\", so far so good. We'll come back to that.","We don't know a lot about Parakeelia's finances, but we do know what it does with quite a lot of its money. It gives it to the Liberal Party. According to Australian Electoral Commission returns, Parakeelia has given more than $1.4 million to the Liberal Party since 2008-2009, including $1.1 million in the past three years.","AEC returns tell us who gave a political party more than $12,100 in any year. Each receipt is listed either as a \"Donation\" or \"Other\". All the Parakeelia payments are shown as \"Other\". The only other information we have on this comes from a statement by a Liberal Party spokeswoman that:","Payments from Parakeelia to the Liberal Party are not donations. These operations are entirely lawful.","The payments are for services provided through the party [and] it's entirely legitimate.","If Parakeelia's money isn't a donation or a loan, then it seems the $1.4 million can only be payment for services rendered by the Liberal Party to Parakeelia. What could the Party be doing for Parakeelia which is so expensive?","This brings us back to the legitimacy question. According to disgruntled, disendorsed Liberal MP Dennis Jensen, what Parakeelia really does is collect information provided by the staff of Liberal MPs from all their contacts with constituents. He says this information has legitimate uses, but \"it's used for data mining for the Liberal Party, for issues relating to trying to get votes, for fundraising and other reasons.\"","First, the Liberal Party's insistence that Parakeelia is paying it money for services, not making donations, supports the proposition that the leg-work involved in building and maintaining Parakeelia's databank is being largely provided by Liberal Party operatives, for which Parakeelia is paying a commercial rate.","Secondly, it's difficult to see how any of this fits the statutory definition of \"parliamentary, electorate or official business\", which is the only lawful basis on which MPs can claim the $2,500 entitlement. The very fact that Parakeelia operates a centralised database, which the whole Liberal Party uses, is inconsistent with the suggestion that each MP is spending their software allowance on Parliamentary or electorate business. Clearly, it's actually party business.","The whole entitlements system is based on a supposedly clear distinction between the legitimate work of MPs - serving their electorates, engaging with constituents, doing work on Parliamentary committees and performing their portfolios if they have any - and the business of trying to get re-elected and promote their party to voters. The latter is a perfectly appropriate and necessary feature of parliamentary democracy; it's just that the public is not supposed to pay for it. Party business is supposed to be funded by the party, using money raised from people who want to support the party. The public purse provides generous election funding, but that's all.","I don't think it's very hard to conclude that the money that Liberal MPs are drawing for their software entitlement and paying to Parakeelia is not legitimately available for that purpose. That is, they're all rorting their entitlement.","I also don't think it's hard to see through the Parakeelia/Liberal Party scam, which works like this: $2,500 per Liberal MP is routed to Parakeelia. Parakeelia's work appears to be largely carried out by the Liberal Party via its MPs' staff, and \"sold\" to Parakeelia at a high price. Parakeelia thus pays large sums to the Liberal Party, which gets the double benefit of the cash and the work product of its own staff. The person paying for it is, by means of this round-robin, the Australian taxpayer.","Is this legal, as the Liberals claim? If the $2,500 entitlement is being legitimately claimed (which I very much doubt, as I explained), then yes it is probably legal. It is, however, deeply immoral. It points to how hopelessly inadequate the current system of parliamentary entitlements and financial disclosure by political parties is; how easy it is for parties to drive a big fat money truck through the holes in that system; how much contempt they have for us; and, again, how badly we need a federal anti-corruption body.","(For the record: the Labor Party's MPs also spend their entitlement on similar software, raising the same issue of legitimacy; however, their software provider is an independent third party. They're still having a lend of us, just to a lower degree of grubbiness.)","That stench you detect is coming from the carcass of the long dead concept of integrity that public service supposedly comprehends; the carrion birds are feasting at will.","Michael Bradley is the managing partner of Sydney law firm Marque Lawyers, and he writes a weekly column for The Drum. He tweets at @marquelawyers.","Comments (404)","Comments for this story are closed.","lucky one percent:","23 Jun 2016 8:12:23am","They want to take this party model of the funding washing machine and apply it on a grand scale to their big business mates via a tax cut.

This information is then compared to reports and receipts on how the money was actually spent, and whether the outcomes were achieved. If the money was spent in a manner contrary to the initial entitlement claim, then that would be a criminal matter of fraud demanding fines be levied at the very least.","2) Entitlements given to individuals can only be used by said individual, and cannot in any way, shape, or form, enter party coffers.","3) Entitlements cannot be paid to a company that party members have any form of investment in, or possess ownership of.","4) A code of ethics will be established surrounding entitlements, much as surrounds the funding of a scientific study, to ensure that the use of the money matches commonwealth ethical standards. For example, this case, whilst not necessarily illegal (it is only illegal if one can prove in a court of law that there is an agreement in place that leads to the reciprocation of payments discussed above), would be considered unethical, and as such would either be blocked or restricted.","5) Inquiries to oversee this system and the use of entitlements to be held regularly, reporting prior to the start of any election campaign.","6) Finally, the establishment of a transparent and independent Federal Corruption Watchdog, with the power to investigate these areas.","deluded_jim:","23 Jun 2016 12:59:38pm","While I see your point, I think calling it corruption is a stretch, in the same way I think calling it laundering is an exaggeration.","And yes, he 'mentioned' Labor briefly twice in his article, but you'll note I said that he only really explored it as a Liberal issue - I stand by that, the majority of what he wrote was looking at software the Libs use, not about the broader issue of government entitlements, which is what he should be looking at as that is where the broader problem sits.","While I applaud your solutions and support a federal ICAC, I fear the remainder of your solutions lack practicality.

Specifically, he was looking at how money taken in for access to the data and software (much of which, if I understand correctly, is of extremely low usefulness for anything other than campaigning) was apparently being returned to Liberal Party coffers via the use of Liberal Party operatives for data-mining. Whilst Labour uses similar software, this second, potentially illegal step of reciprocating funds raised through the entitlement of individual MP's into the party coffers is not present, meaning that the issue on that side is whether said software is a legitimate use of funds, not if that software is being re-purposed through a third party.","Giving them a set amount is essentially what the current system is, and without proper oversight it fails. Additionally, what I am referring to would not particularly be onerous, it's just a question of budgeting in advance; which most offices would be doing anyway, and then checking to make sure that that budget is both reasonable, and that the end result is what was claimed.

Assuming that this payment is contingent on the payment via entitlement for electoral research (the bulk of which is either skimmed from aggregators or from surveys performed by members of the Liberal Party to justify the money paid to them from the company), this would constitute a form of either rorting or laundering; as the money which is monitored can be seen to be processed through a 3rd party to avoid monitoring, with the money then being put to a prohibited purpose.","You can dispute the facts of the case all you want, but the current evidence we have is enough to raise questions about the legality of these actions.","In any case, my question, as I have said, was based on definition. If running controlled money through a third party company to a source that is prohibited from receiving it is not laundering, what word can be used to describe it? A rort? A loophole?

And really at the end of next week, we wont really know, what the Government will look like, right down to when polling closes, it comes down to what people are thinking on that day. I still believe though enough information is in the public domain, for people to make the judgement, something is very wrong with politics in this country, and if they can't be honest and own up to make reforms, then it comes down to individual voters, to make a more informed choice, and remove politicians from Government. If political parties are moved to the sideline, they will soon try to figure out, they need to get their act back together. Minor parties and Independents, will not make a bigger mess then now. I suspect they would try to fix the mess left behind, and be more honest and open, to say look this has gone on, it needs to be fixed. All this article tells me, is you are taken for a granted by blindly following your favourite political colour. The big parties are down to the chicken little cries, Medicare - Boat People, the sky is falling. This should tell you, don't be fooled, keep calm, and vote for someone who is not from these franchise of lies. It is down to the voters to reform politics, and you do that when you vote. The answer is simple, if did the things in your job, politicians are doing, and it is illegal, then you know you are supporting the wrong people. The only change we make each election is, the bad, the ugly, to the corrupt, we keep recycling the same offenders, each election.","Filz:","23 Jun 2016 9:20:22am","On the subject of the privacy laws, MPs and their staffs are exempt, as they routinely have to liaise between their constituents and organisations like Centrelink or Families SA etc. There is no reason why the exemption should apply to political parties, however.","Serendipitous:","Alan:","23 Jun 2016 9:38:10am","'The current state of politics in this country, is down to people who vote without thinking.'

This all highlights, the clumsy behavior, that everyone gets too carried away and the true colours reveal themselves. Why would you pick a dispute with rural fire fighting volunteers, in the middle of an election campaign, other then Unions mates trying to take over the organisation. The same with the political pickets, a Union that has direct links to OCMG members. This is why Australian politics just sees a revolving door of vested interests. Either of the major political parties does not stray far from home. And both sides are so entrenched in their \"ways\" that they have direct links to people, who make the laws so they can exist, and flout the law, so long as they support their political brand. The way politics is constructed in this county, there are too many ways, for organsiations, to stack the local party branch, and elect their man, to do the job they want, pass legislation, that allows them loopholes in the law, to use stand over tactics, and there is no concern for the human cost.","Both sides of politics have crafted the art of deniability, however in the modern world of the internet, very quickly what people have denied in the past, can be put on there for all to see.

Both sides take no prisoners in chasing down the dubious connections they have been those who support them, and are the real power brokers of our Government. Tie this in with both sides having companies to filter funds to hide the identity of political donations. The Coalition has undue influence from big business, Labor from the Unions, and Greens their cult of personality. All this speaks of the fact, they are comfortable with fact, not too much is going to change, and they see to that, by bringing out in this last few days of the campaign, the old tricks, to shore up support.

An onslaught of negative reactions ensued both from many people and the press due to deep-seated concerns Facebook doesn’t care about digital privacy and rather profit off knowing as much about users — like their tendencies and traits — as possible.","“I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,” Cook said during a forum in Beijing over the weekend, according to Bloomberg. “The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view, it shouldn’t exist.”","If they wanted to, Apple could make plenty of money by monetizing the customer, Cook said Wednesday with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and Swisher.","Cook and Apple, however, are sometimes recipients of other forms of criticism.

The proposal also exempts services that are required to collect certain data to comply with security laws.","Consumer watchdogs have called for the European Commission to introduce a minimum fine against companies that break EU rules, after Facebook and Twitter failed to reform their user terms.","Online marketplace transparency","Another measure in the overhaul requires online marketplaces to inform consumers about how they rank different search results.","This means that ecommerce retailers that sell products from other companies, such as Amazon’s Marketplace, will need to inform shoppers about any “default ranking criteria” that determine what search results they are shown, and in what order.","Online marketplaces will also need to explain whether they are buying from the platform directly or from a third party company. Platforms will not to display that information to shoppers clearly, and cannot bury it in the fine print of their terms and conditions.","Higher post-Dieselgate fines","In a move aimed at avoiding low fines like the ones that have been imposed against Volkswagen in some EU countries, the Commission overhaul will also give national consumer protection authorities the power to impose higher sanctions against companies that break the rules.","EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova has called for tougher sanctions against misbehaving firms.","Her proposal next month will step up potential fines to total 4% of a company’s turnover in each EU member state for “widespread infringements”.","The draft bill includes an explicit reference to the need for tougher enforcement measures because of “recent large-scale cross-border infringements of EU consumer law, such as the ‘Dieselgate’ scandal and massive flight cancellations”.","After it emerged in 2015 that Volkswagen used illegal software to cheat on emissions tests, the company was hit with fines in some EU countries, but at much lower rates than the firm was forced to pay in the United States.","The proposal allows EU member states to set the fine at an even higher rate than 4% of a company’s turnover if they want to, or they can determine a “fixed lump-sum, whichever is higher in the specific case”.","Some member states allow for higher sanctions. Italian authorities can impose fines of up to €5 million if a firm breaks national consumer protection law, and Poland can demand up to 10% of a company’s turnover.","The proposal for higher sanctions will likely appeal to consumer watchdog groups.","Last month, the European Consumer Organisation, an umbrella group representing national associations from EU countries, called for the Commission to set a minimum fine punishing consumer violations. The group demanded tougher sanctions in response to Jourova’s announcement that Facebook and Twitter do not comply with EU consumer rules.","The organisation’s director Monique Goyens said fines “should not be symbolic but a real deterrent, going up to a percentage of the company’s annual worldwide turnover”.","Consumer advocates have urged the European Commission to propose legislation allowing for collective EU lawsuits after the bloc’s top court rejected a class action against Facebook on Thursday (25 January)."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

The analytics firm worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign in an effort to target and sway potentially tens of millions of voters.","It is a messy situation, one that has led to reports of Facebook suffering a security breach.

{"originalurl":"http://lifeinsurance-orleans.ca/Life-Insurance-Blog/is-zuckerberg-willing-to-act-boldly-to-fix-facebook-crisis/","title":"Is Zuckerberg willing to act boldly to fix Facebook crisis?","text":["Is Zuckerberg willing to act boldly to fix Facebook crisis?","As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U.S. presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg’s to-do list landed him on a fishing trawler off Alabama’s Gulf coast.","But the chatter surrounding the CEO’s arrival in port was that it signalled something bigger than just the start of a 30-state personal tour: his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2.2 billion people worldwide.","“It was one of the last things I asked him, thinking it would put a smile on his face — and it did,” said Dominick Ficarino, who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and hosted a dockside lunch for Zuckerberg that Sunday afternoon.","“I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States. And his answer to me was: ‘Can I answer you with a question? If you were me, would you?”‘","Thirteen months later, Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act. Instead, he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name. It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook’s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself.","“The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do,” Zuckerberg wrote in January, laying out the “personal challenge” that he sets for himself each year.","In 2017, the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he’d never visited. This year, long after critics began demanding an overhaul, Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to “fix” the platform that he has engineered to build community — but that is increasingly blamed for warping it.","Yet things continue to get worse. Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users — possibly used to aid Donald Trump’s campaign — and that the social network has been collecting Android users’ phone call and text message histories without notice. That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information.","On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices.","Throughout the mounting crisis, Zuckerberg’s response has been a study in contradictions. He crisscrossed the country, even as his company back home came under increasing fire. He preaches transparency, but flinches at questioning and craves privacy. He is undeniably brilliant, but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook’s problems.","Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship. But at 33, is he prepared to do all it will take?","“If he fails to do it, it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel,” said Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become one of the company’s most pointed critics.","“I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time,” McNamee said. “I think it’s really hard to make that case today.”","——","Days after Trump’s election, Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters.","“The idea that fake news on Facebook … influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,” the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference.","“I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was,” said David Kirkpatrick, the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day. “You can certainly say that he was culpable, in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system. But I don’t think he was lying.”","Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after, continuing a years-long routine of self-correction. But errors that reflect his stubbornness, those who know him say, are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection.","Donald Graham, the former chairman of the Washington Post Co., recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005, outsiders still weren’t sure what to make of Facebook.","“I would ask him a question and he would pause long enough — 15 seconds, 20 seconds — that I would think ‘Did I insult him? Did he not hear me?”‘ said Graham, who went on to serve on the company’s board from 2008 to 2015.","“Since I am from Washington, I’m not used to people thinking before they are answering a question. … But Mark, then as now, was thinking about the right answer.”","Zuckerberg’s boyish appearance, even today, is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world’s biggest social network, back in his dorm room at Harvard.","“I didn’t know anything about building a company or global internet service,” he wrote in January. “Over the years I’ve made almost every mistake you can imagine.”","Naomi Gleit, Facebook’s longest-serving employee after the CEO, said Zuckerberg — who declined an interview request from The Associated Press — has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21. But his view of that world and his place in it “seemed almost like a gravity, a burden of responsibility,” she said.","That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty.","Gleit recalled Zuckerberg’s steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email, even as more people began using phones to send text messages. But co-workers eventually swayed the CEO, who she described as a “learn-it-all.” That change-of-mind informed Facebook’s 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for $19 billion.","“I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong,” Gleit said.","With Zuckerberg, “its experiment, learn, experiment, learn,” said LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who has known him since 2004. Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for software, which can be overwritten to fix problems. That facility, he said, makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience.","But in the process of learning, Zuckerberg’s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view.","——","In 2010, Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey’s television show that he would donate $100 million to schools in Newark, New Jersey.","Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image, just as the biopic “The Social Network” was being released. Still, there was little questioning his generosity. The problem was that Zuckerberg — who knew little about education — made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent.","“He was just a very young, naive, inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet, but just really didn’t know much about how the world worked,” said Dale Russakoff, author of “The Prize,” a book chronicling how the money went to high-priced consultants, with minimal effort by leaders to build community support.","By the end of the process, Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done. He and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals, like a $3 billion investment to cure, prevent or manage all diseases. He has pledged to donate 99 per cent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy.","“Zuck’s maturation has occurred in front of the public,” said Kirkpatrick, author of “The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World.” “But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature.”","At Facebook, Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals, which includes purchasing competitors — or companies that could grow into competitors.","Facebook’s $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012 — then unprofitable and little-known — came as a shock to Wall Street. Two years later came the multibillion-dollar deal to buy WhatsApp, a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U.S.","In 2014, soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus, Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets. Under questioning, he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen, and his vision of growing it so fast “that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists.”","Last year, in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy, Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook’s stock, allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control. That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors’ stakes. Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit, the company dropped the plan.","The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg, who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don’t always align.","The paradox is self-inflicted, the trade-off for creating a venture premised on users’ willingness to share details of their lives. That requires Zuckerberg, who has 105 million Facebook “friends,” to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO, whether its photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year.","Yet he fiercely guards his privacy.","When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee, the company sent its lawyer. And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year, they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians — withdrawn after protests — that would have cut off locals’ access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate’s boundaries.","Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business.","Stops on last year’s U.S. tour, never announced, were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few. But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional-quality photos on Zuckerberg’s Facebook page soon after he’d departed.","Ostensibly, the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn. But in their brief interactions, many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him.","In Hazard, Kentucky, educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town’s biggest secret. A staffer from Zuckerberg’s foundation, peppering Green with questions about the region’s educational co-operative, finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit. Green’s reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide-eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming.","Walking through science demonstrations, Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers.","“He just lit up with those kids,” Green said. “The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology, it really was cool.”","When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston, North Dakota, last July, “from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car, he was nothing but questions,” said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which arranged the visit.","“I had Bakken shale, limestone, dolomite, and he was able to hold them in his hand, along with a bottle of crude oil. And I remember him asking, ‘How do you get that oil out of that rock?”‘ geologist Kathleen Neset said.","In Dayton, Ohio, Zuckerberg met with officials, caregivers and families battling drug addiction. Lori Erion, the founder of the group Families of Addicts, said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter, April, had shot up heroin in their own home.","“It seemed to get him really emotional,” Erion said, recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself. When he returned, he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment.","“We didn’t ever talk about Facebook at all,” Erion said, “which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out. He really was just like a regular person.”","——","As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face-to-face, controversy over Facebook continued to spiral.","Shortly before the election, McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended. It wasn’t just about the U.S. election: A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments, and critics had detected a well-organized, clandestine campaign supporting Brexit.","All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook — that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform.","McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since.","Facebook has adopted this “libertarian philosophy that says ‘we are not responsible for anything downstream, we are allowed to disrupt media, we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that,”‘ he said.","Zuckerberg could change that. But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through. And tweaking Facebook’s newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive.","“You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place, which is what Zuck recommends,” McNamee wrote in an email.","Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes, but Zuckerberg’s supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen.","Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset, making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment — without completely shutting out inflammatory content.","“Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave. That’s a very democratic argument. If people want to live in filter bubbles, who are we to say ‘Don’t live in filter bubbles,’ even though we don’t want them to?” Hoffman said.","But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg’s and Sandberg’s surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities. The company can’t be fixed, Kirkpatrick said, until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business — its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users.","“There’s no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing,” he said. “However, I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world. And I also don’t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true.”","McNamee, recalling Zuckerberg as a 22-year-old visionary, said the CEO must be willing to rethink long-held assumptions. But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community.","“You’ve won,” McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel.","“You’ve achieved more than your wildest dreams. You’re a billionaire. Now you have a chance to be a hero.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

It’s true that my role did change.”","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","London-based Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","However, further allegations about the firm’s tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery.","Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report “is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”","Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the U.S. Congress after the reports in the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend.","Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.","Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.","Late on Monday, the Connecticut Attorney General said the office will initiate an inquiry into Facebook data policies.","The Senate was expected to move forward on Monday with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking.","The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

But to get there he’ll have to battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who exploit and hijack groups to make money or sow chaos.","One week after the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, those searching on Facebook for information about the upcoming March for Our Lives were likely to be shown an active group with more than 50,000 members.","Called “March for Our Lives 2018 Official,” it appeared to be one of the best places to get details about the event and connect with others interested in gun control. But those who joined the group soon found themselves puzzled. The admins often posted pro-gun information and unrelated memes and mocked those who posted about gun control.","“I'm a retired federal law enforcement special agent. There is and never has been any reason for a civilian to have a high-capacity high velocity weapon,” posted one member on Feb. 20.","“Shutup fed and stop trying to spread your NWO BS,” was the top reply, which came from one of the group’s admins. (NWO is a reference to the “new world order” conspiracy theory.)","A few days later the group’s name was changed to “Kim Jong Un Fan Club,” and members continued to wonder what was going on.","The simple answer is they were being trolled. The more complicated one is that while Facebook groups may offer a positive experience for millions of people around the world, they have also become a global honeypot of spam, fake news, conspiracies, health misinformation, harassment, hacking, trolling, scams, and other threats to users, according to reporting by BuzzFeed News, findings from researchers, and the recent indictment of 13 Russians for their alleged efforts to interfere in the US election.","“This vision could backfire terribly: an increase in the weight of ‘groups’ means reinforcement of Facebook’s worst features — cognitive bubbles — where users are kept in silos fueled by a torrent of fake news and extremism,” wrote Frederic Filloux, coauthor of the influential weekly media commentary newsletter Monday Note.","“Propagandists and spammers need to amass an audience, and groups serve that up on a platter. There’s no need to run an ad campaign to find people receptive to your message if you can simply join relevant groups and start posting,” she said.","To her point, the recent indictment of the 13 Russians repeatedly cited Facebook groups as a focus of workers at the Internet Research Agency.","“By 2016, the size of many organization-controlled groups had grown to hundreds of thousands of online followers,” the indictment said.","One part of the Russian effort on Facebook left unmentioned in the Mueller indictment — and that has not previously been reported — is that Facebook’s group recommendation system encouraged fans of troll-run pages such as Blactivist and Heart of Texas to organize themselves into groups based on their shared affinity for a page. To this day there remain many groups with automatically generated names such as “Friends Who Like Blacktivist” or “Friends Who Like Heart of Texas.” These groups appear to be small and inactive, but the fact remains that Facebook prompted Americans to organize into fan groups of Russian troll pages.","There’s no question that groups offer value to many Facebook users. They keep friends and former classmates close, and played a key role in helping organize the West Virginia teachers’ strike. They are the basis for a thriving global community of buy, sell, and barter networks. Groups were used to raise money for victims of the Las Vegas shooting, and help provide support to, and prevent suicide among, US military personnel. Facebook groups can restrict membership by being designated “secret” or “closed,” and as a result people often share deeply personal information and experiences because they feel protected from the prying eyes of search engines and the public at large.","That’s the case for Female IN, a secret Facebook group that today boasts a membership of more than 1.5 million women around the world. It was created by Lola Omolola, a Nigerian-born journalist now living in Chicago. She started it after more than 250 schoolgirls were kidnapped by a terrorist group in Nigeria. Many of the women in the group live in, or are originally from, African countries. But Omolola said it has grown to include women from other parts of the world.","Secret groups like FIN are completely invisible to anyone who is not a member, and Facebook users can only join if they are invited by a current member. This is different from closed groups, which can be found via search, show up on user profiles, and enable anyone to request to be added to the group.","“We discuss everything from everyday day stuff like your children, your healthcare, and your individual interactions with people. We go from there to talking about domestic violence. People are sharing in real time what happens at their homes,” Omolola told BuzzFeed News in an interview facilitated by Facebook’s PR team. “Generally we are very actively and thoughtfully healing a population of women who are used to being silenced, and whose voices have never really historically mean that much.”","But even a group that Facebook itself points to as an example of the product’s value has to wage a battle against bad actors. Omolola and other FIN admins work constantly to keep men and spammers out of the group. They have to warn members about imposter FIN groups on Facebook that try to leverage her group’s success and brand among women. A post to the public FIN Facebook page from last fall warned women of a “FAKE FIN run by A MAN!!!”","“Some people try to use the [FIN] name to get a lot of people to their groups,” Omolola said. “We have contacted Facebook and Facebook knows about it, and are working on ways to protect us.”","Omolola says she working on trademarking the group’s name so she can ask Facebook can enforce her trademark and take imposter groups down faster. Right now, it’s mostly up to her and her members to go into fake FIN groups and warn people that it’s a scam.","Jennifer Dulski, the head of groups and community at Facebook, told BuzzFeed News that there is now a dedicated “integrity” team for groups, which includes people who specialize in security, product, machine learning, and content moderation. She pointed to new tools launched last year that help admins screen and easily remove members, and that lets admins clearly state the rules of a given group on its About page. (Omolola said these new features are all big time savers.)","“There is some negative content and behavior happening on Facebook, including in groups, and we take that really seriously,” Dulski said.","She emphasized that the the experience for most users is positive.","“It’s amazing to see what is actually happening in Facebook groups, and the vast majority of of activity and content in these groups is not only positive but also meaningful for the people involved in them.”","DiResta sees a parallel, suggesting groups are at the same stage pages and the News Feed were prior to Facebook’s 2016 wake-up call about fake news: rife with manipulation and lacking proper oversight.","“We need to avoid a repeat of the kind of persuasive manipulation we saw on pages, so Facebook needs to be pay attention to these issues as they continue to increase their emphasis on groups,” DiResta said.","That emphasis on groups is now a cornerstone of Zuckerberg’s vision for the company and product. Last summer he announced an ambitious goal to drastically increase the number of Facebook users in “meaningful” groups from 100 to 1 billion.","“If we can do this, it will not only turn around the whole decline in community membership we've seen for decades, it will start to strengthen our social fabric and bring the world closer together,” he said in a speech at Facebook’s first Community Summit last summer.","But to get to a billion, Facebook will have to acknowledge and battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who constantly exploit, take over, and buy and sell groups in order to make money or sow chaos. It will also have to confront the fact that its own recommendation engine at times pushes users into conspiracy theorist groups, or into those geared toward trolling, harassment, or illicit online activity.","The global exploitation of groups","As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, members of a Facebook group called Republicans Suck suddenly experienced an influx of new members who spammed the group with links to questionable stories on websites they’d never heard of.","Bobby Ison, a Kentucky man who was member of the group, told BuzzFeed News that he noticed the administrators and moderators of the group began to change and “some of them were obvious foreign accounts. Eastern European countries. Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia.”","Ison said he and others learned that the Facebook account of one of the group’s original admins had been hacked. With control of the admin’s Facebook profile, the hackers were then able to add whoever they wanted as admins, and remove the group’s original leaders.","“When they got his [account], they booted the other admins, and moved more of theirs in,” Ison said. “It was rather sad to witness.” (The admin whose account Ison said was hacked did not respond to inquiries from BuzzFeed News.)","Eventually, former admins and members fled to start a new, closed group called","“As some of you know, the old REPUBLICANS SUCK has been hacked and taken over by hackers and trolls, which is something that is happening in several groups,” reads the pinned message for the group from one of its administrators.","Ison said the old group’s new overseas admins stepped up their spamming efforts in order to drive traffic from the group to their sites, presumably so they could earn ad revenue.","“It turned into a horrible page after they finally took over. Posting some of the most outlandish stories I've seen,” he said.","BuzzFeed News spoke via Facebook Messenger with one of the profiles currently listed as an admin of the group. That account has previously posted online about a Ford van for sale in Macedonia and written posts in Macedonian. Many of the account’s earliest posts in groups were for online moneymaking schemes. The person running the account said they were only added as an admin of the group two months earlier and didn't know anything about the group takeover last year.","“For the first time I hear from you that this group is stolen,” they wrote. They said they are not profiting in any way from the group. (BuzzFeed News could not confirm whether the profile’s name is linked to a real person.)","“We have no interest, we have no profit, we do not do with advertisements,” they said, and offered to make a BuzzFeed News reporter an admin of the group as a sign of goodwill.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups.\"","BuzzFeed News previously documented how political Facebook groups were exploited to spread political fake news to Americans during the 2016 election and beyond. An article published on Election Day revealed that Macedonian spammers used fake profiles to spam Trump and Bernie Sanders groups to generate engagement for their often false pro-Trump stories.","The tactic of spamming groups is by no means restricted to US politics or those targeting US audiences.","Rappler, an independent news website in the Philippines, last month published a story about a seemingly fake Facebook profile that spammed groups with links to websites that carried positive news about President Rodrigo Duterte. At one point the profile took over a fan group for a South Korean actor and changed its name to “President Duterte Supporters.”","Rappler found that the account posted hundreds of links to pro-Duterte news in Facebook groups since last summer. “She had also posted 307 times in various groups linking to a website called ‘Philippine Republic News’ which carries fake stories such as Oprah's support for President Duterte,” the story said.","A report on troll farms and fake news in the Philippines by two researchers included a case study showing that paid trolls tasked with helping win an election “came up with fake profiles and populated a Facebook group dedicated to the city they were trying to win.”","Facebook groups are also an engine of misinformation in Myanmar. Thura, a worker with a Myanmar social media research organisation, told BuzzFeed News by email that “Facebook groups are being used widely to spread hatred.” (BuzzFeed News agreed to conceal his identity due to security and safety concerns related to the work he does in Myanmar.)","Thura said people are using groups to spread hate and misinformation because they’re aware that less of the content posted to pages will reach the News Feed. So they focus on groups as a cheaper and more reliable way to reach people.","“Since Facebook pages do not normally go into News Feed unless they pay ads, groups are a good way to raise visibility of some of the fake news,” Thura wrote. “Groups are also a good strategy for [generating] engagement for a post from a page, meaning once a page posts a content, their network share them in several different groups.”","Spamming fake stories into groups is also the preferred tactic of American fake news publishers. Jestin Coler is a California man who ran more than a dozen early fake news sites such as National Report starting in 2013. He exited the fake news game last year and now says he’s focused on trying to use his experience to help battle online misinformation. Coler told BuzzFeed News that spamming groups was, and continues to be, a key traffic strategy for fake stories — and it’s still not being dealt with by Facebook.","“Joining Facebook groups that are related to the content being promoted, then spamming links throughout those groups using various aliases, is quite effective,” he said. “Members of the group then essentially become ‘bots’ and often share content to their network (outside of the group) creating a more organic-looking campaign.”","Coler said it was standard practice to identify specific Facebook groups related to the topic of a fake story and then join them all at once to enable link spamming.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups,” he said.","His lack of knowledge of American pop culture also caused him to share the link in a group dedicated to the TV show It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He apparently thought it was a group focused on the city. (He did not reply to requests for comment at the time.) One town in Kosovo is also home to a network of groups that spread fake news to Americans, according to a recent report by Media Matters.","Facebook’s intention to give even more visibility to group content in the News Feed will now make this tactic even more appealing. It could also result in more takeovers of groups. There’s evidence this is already happening.","Two weeks after Facebook announced its latest News Feed algorithm changes, former admins and members of “Mystic Fire Native Heart,” a group with tens of thousands of members, began posting to warn that it had been taken over by hackers from Eastern Europe.","Keyword squatting and targeted harassment","Another tactic that could become more frequent with the elevation of groups by Facebook is what researcher Joan Donovan calls “keyword squatting.” The group that changed its name to “March for Our Lives 2018 Official” in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is a perfect example. That group has over time gained tens of thousands of members thanks to the admins changing its title to different topical names that are likely to attract new members.","When Stephen Hawking died last week the group changed its name to “RIP STEPHEN HAWKING 2018” and as a result showed up as a top three result in a groups search for “stephen hawking.”","Facebook","“This is a feature that they have learned to leverage and you can imagine if they have learned to do it there are hundreds if not thousands of other groups changing the keyword weekly in order to get attention,” said Donovan, who leads the media manipulation project for the research institute Data & Society. (Facebook declined to comment on that group’s tactics.)","Thura said keyword squatting is a common tactic in Myanmar, too. People will start a Facebook group with a topic that has broad appeal and is not connected to news. Then, once it’s gained enough members, the admins switch its name and start sharing false stories.","“The strategy they used often is that they start with a different name and then once they have a large amount of users, they change it to a different name such as ‘Let’s Share News’ group,” Thura said.","Dulski, who oversees groups at Facebook, said the company has invested in new tools to enable group members to report content that may violate the terms of service, or a group’s specific rules.","“One is tool for members to report posts that might be violating the rules, and they can report this to the admins of the group and to Facebook,” she said. “This allows admins to quickly and easily review and keep bad content from appearing.”","In cases of hate speech or offensive content, Dilski said Facebook uses machine learning to automatically flag posts that may be violating the terms of service, regardless of whether people report it or not.","Thura said he and other have found it’s often pointless to flag content or complain to group admins about fake news since they’re often the ones spreading it.","There are in fact groups that exist solely to engage in activities that violate Facebook’s terms of service. One group, Republic of Kekistan, amassed more than 30,000 members before being removed by Facebook earlier this year. BuzzFeed News joined the group last year and watched as members coordinated online harassment campaigns, most of which were targeted at trans women and left-leaning Facebook pages. The group was also home to hate speech, such as a post where one member posted a photo of a handgun and asked, \"What kind of Muslim repellant do y'all carry?\"","Facebook","The process for planning raids was simple: One group member shared a link to a piece of content they didn’t agree with and added the word “raid” to signal like-minded members to flood the comments of the content in question with nasty, often hate-filled messages and other types of trolling. Some calls for raids went unnoticed by the rest of the group, but others funneled dozens of hateful comments to unsuspecting victims.","At one point, a post in the group asked members to “raid the comments” of a fundraising post for the family of Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed during the Charlottesville demonstrations last year. Another post encouraged members to post laughing reactions to a Facebook post about a trans teen who committed suicide (The group’s description page at one point warned members, “No raid posts allowed. The safety of the nation must be guarded against retaliatory attacks.” But it appeared that policy was enforced loosely, if at all.)","BuzzFeed News","Planning coordinated online attacks is against Facebook policy, but members of Republic of Kekistan seemingly stayed under Facebook’s radar and went unpunished for months. Sophie Labelle, a cartoonist from Montreal and a trans woman, was targeted last May. Labelle writes a web comic called Assigned Male and is the author of several comic books about being trans. Labelle told BuzzFeed News she’s used to the online harassment that comes with being a trans public figure, but this was an extreme case.","Trolls posted her home address online and she had to move. Labelle said her roommate, who’s also trans, felt threatened too. The trolls also targeted a bookstore hosting her launch and as a result it was canceled. (That raid worked out in Labelle's favor: the added attention helped her book sell out its first printing.)","“I feel pretty powerless. It’s kind of a given that when you show support to me it makes you a target,” she said.","Labelle said there are conspiracy theories about her online and even her readers are sometimes targeted if they leave a comment on one of her social media posts.","Labelle suspects Republic of Kekistan was behind the May harassment, but she does not know for sure. As payback, her supporters decided to band together to coordinate mass-reporting of the Facebook group for violating the platform’s terms of service, and Facebook eventually shut it down temporarily that same month. The group reemerged at some point after the ban and was active again as recently as January, according to an online archive. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about when and why Republic of Kekistan was taken offline.","A marketplace of black hat groups services","Groups have become attractive enough for both legitimate and bad actors that there’s now a flourishing online marketplace of apps and services related to exploiting them.","There are multiple software apps that can automate posting links in groups and also automate the process of joining groups and inviting other profiles into them. For a small fee, you can buy new members to make your group seem more popular than it is, pay to spam a link of your choosing in groups with large numbers of members to try to drive traffic, or hire someone to go into a group and capture the email addresses of members in order to enable further spamming and targeting.","All of the aforementioned services violate Facebook’s terms of service, but they are easily found with a simple online search, or by going to a freelancing site such as Fiverr. Many of these services are offered by people based in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India.","“Looking for a Facebook promotion expert to help you post and promote your products, services to millions of real and active Facebook group members ???” read one recent Fiverr ad. “Search no more.I am here to give you full expert service that will promote your ads or links to about 40 million real and active Facebook group members.”","To learn how these providers add hundreds or thousands of members to groups, BuzzFeed News purchased a total of 6,000 members for three groups it set up. One person on Fiverr charged $6 to provide 5,000 members for a group. BuzzFeed News then purchased two more sets of 500 members from different providers that were found by simply searching Google for “buy facebook group members.”","People all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","One company charged $25 to add 500 members that were located in the US or UK. Another charged just $6 for 500 members that were not accounts specifically based in those two countries. In each case the process was the same: After the order was placed BuzzFeed News was contacted by email or Facebook and told to make a specific Facebook profile an administrator of the group. Once done, the administrator began quickly adding other Facebook accounts to the group. Suddenly these newly created groups appeared more popular than they were, and were likely to show up higher in search results on Facebook.","The profiles added to the groups appeared to belong to real people, though a sampling of some of them found they were inactive for a year or two. The orders that did not specify US and UK profiles saw accounts added primarily from Bangladesh and India.","A man in Pakistan who helped fulfil one of the orders told BuzzFeed News in a Facebook Messenger chat that he could easily add large numbers of profiles to any group in a short amount of time.","“I do even 500,000 members in single group easily,” he said.","He said the accounts he adds to a group belong to real people. The key is that he controls many Facebook accounts that he uses to friend real people. Once two accounts are friends, Facebook easily allows one profile to add the other into a public group without requiring their permission. (In the case of closed and secret groups, the invited profile must accept the request.)","The result is that people all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","The man told BuzzFeed News he uses a computer programming script to automatically add members in batches of 500 to 700. If he does more than that at a time he risks being banned by Facebook. But that limit appears to do little to deter those selling group members. (Once he saw that the BuzzFeed News reporter had a verified Facebook profile he offered to pay to get profiles he controls verified.)","Facebook","Facebook groups themselves are also places to purchase black-hat online marketing services. BuzzFeed News joined a group dedicated to Google’s AdSense advertising network and saw a post from an admin that listed his services. One item for sale? Facebook groups.","“I have facebook trade and sell groups for sale 20k to 40k members,” he wrote.","Radicalization by the recommendation engine","DiResta, the security researcher, first saw the risks of groups in 2015 while researching health conspiracy content and communities on social networks. She joined anti-vaccine parenting groups on Facebook and watched as well-meaning parents became increasingly radicalized in their views of Western medicine. She also saw false and misleading links spread quickly within groups.","DiResta also documented how group members coordinated the sharing of specific links on Twitter and other platforms to create the impression of an outpouring of support for a specific point of view. “They didn’t have bots but they were effectively replicating the function of bots,” DiResta said. “They were using these groups to coordinate and spread these messages.”","Facebook’s recommendation system also began its own process of algorithmic radicalization. DiResta noticed that as her account became more involved in anti-vax groups Facebook shifted the kind of groups it recommended to her. She was soon being shown groups about chemtrails, fluoride conspiracies, and flat Earth. As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, Facebook suggested she join groups dedicated to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. DiResta calls it “radicalization via the recommendation engine.”","She provided two screenshots to BuzzFeed News, both taken in December 2016, that show Pizzagate group recommendations for her profile. The largest group being pitched had more than 12,000 members at the time.","Similarly, after BuzzFeed News joined the group dedicated to gaming and cheating AdSense, Facebook’s recommendation engine surfaced a list of groups dedicated to the same topics, as if to say, “We see you enjoy ad and click fraud. Try these groups to learn more.”","Facebook also uses data about groups membership to recommend new friends. At the same time that the groups recommendation engine can push people further to the fringe, Facebook will suggest new friends who reinforce these perspectives.","Another concern for DiResta is how secret groups are used to further the radicalization process. When she was researching the anti-vax community she found it was easy to join open and closed groups. But she soon discovered that people used secret groups to exchange the most sensitive information and even engage in illegal activity.","“People would go into a group and say, ‘Hey, I need to get a medical exemption [for vaccines] for my kid’ and someone would say, ‘Hang on, I’ll DM you.’ Then gradually they recruit you into a secret group,” she said. “There was a whole underground network of information sharing around which doctors to go to in order to get fraudulent medical exemptions.”","DiResta said Facebook must find a way to strike a balance between letting people search for and talk about the topics they want without actively radicalizing or polarizing them.","“People have a right to search for Pizzagate and join Pizzagate groups, yes,” she said. “But for Facebook to be continuously, proactively surfacing these types of groups to people, that I think is where the ethics of the recommender system is insufficiently developed right now.”","“At a minimum, it needs to be studying how often people respond to these suggestions, and how groups may be impacting polarization,” she said. “Only Facebook has this data.”","Tellingly, even those who are happily engaging in conspiracy theory groups on Facebook also express frustration with how the product is being exploited. Last month a member of the PizzagateUncompromised group (7,500 members) posted a warning.","Facebook","“The groups Exposing the Rothschilds and Pizzagate Exposed were hijacked,” he wrote.","It happened the same way that “Republicans Suck” and “Mystic Fire Native Heart” were taken over.","“It happens in a lot of groups,” replied one person. “Time to look for some good alternatives to FB imo.” ●","Craig Silverman is a media editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in Toronto."],"isopubdate":""}

The higher your score, the more likely you'll be accepted for a loan or credit card.","Traditional credit reference firms such as Experian and Equifax calculate this by looking at how many credit cards and bank accounts you have, if you pay your bills on time and whether you're on the electoral roll.","But newer companies claim they can use social media to verify someone's identity and predict whether they will be a good borrower.","It says it can build a picture of your financial health by analysing anything from social media and emails to mobile phone activity.","Crucially, you have to agree to let the company access these accounts by setting up an account online or downloading the mobile app.","Then you can choose which accounts the company can access. If you select Twitter, for example, it will build a picture of your interests by looking at who your followers are and what you write in direct messages.","If you have Gmail, it can monitor your emails to get an idea of how you spend your money via receipts for online shopping, or tickets for events or flights.","A new breed of credit scoring companies rely on social media to help banks, mobile phone giants and even car finance companies make lending decisions","From LinkedIn, it can check you haven't lied about your education and employment history.","If you sign up for the mobile app, the firm can also monitor your whereabouts via its GPS tracker to see the sorts of places you visit and where you live and work.","The app also has access to your contacts and advises you only to store the details of creditworthy friends and family on your phone.","'Choose the friends and family that you keep in your contact book wisely,' it says on the app.","Carphone Warehouse's iD Mobile says it is working with Friendlyscore to trial its technology as an alternative way of verifying someone's identity.","This should help people who have not yet built up a traditional credit history, perhaps because they are young or new to the country. Friendlyscore adds that it doesn't see any of the data collected and says it does not assess the creditworthiness of customers.","Loubna Bazine, chief executive of Friendlyscore, says: 'All of the data analysis is done by machines. No humans look at it. We then pass the company a score and a short report of our findings.'","What's your score?","She says around 10,000 people have signed up to its service in the UK and that the firm has created scores for 1 million people worldwide.","Friendlyscore, which has a London office, is applying for a licence from the financial regulator to be able to view your bank account spending under the new Open Banking rules.","Some customers may have used this type of credit scoring system without even hearing of Friendlyscore, as firms can choose to brand the service as their own.","Data analytics company Hello Soda, based in Manchester, said on its website that it has worked with Visa Europe and payday lender peachy.co.uk. It said its software system 'Profile' — which can be integrated into a firm's sign-up or application process — can analyse the digital 'footprint' of a consumer to verify their identity and personalise marketing.","On the Peachy website, for example, you can sign up for a loan through your Facebook account.","If you do this Peachy will receive access to your posts, birthday, education and work history, email address and even photos and posts you have 'liked'. Again, customers must first give their permission for firms to access their data.","A report published two years ago by Visa Europe, which no longer works with Hello Soda, says: 'It is much harder to fake a genuine social media footprint than it is to falsify alternative means of identification.'","It adds that this type of technology could reduce fraud as the more firms know about customers and their behaviour, the more likely it is that they will spot out-of-the-ordinary spending.","This type of information also allows firms to personalise advertisements and products based on your hobbies and interests.","Facebook checks for car cover","Insurers keep a close eye on their customers' social media profiles to weed out suspected fraud.","In one case dealt with by the Financial Ombudsman last year, an insurer tried to stop making payments to a customer who had claimed on their income protection policy.","The insurer, Unum, had found posts on a social media site that showed the customer, who had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, taking part in activities that 'were inconsistent with his reported limitations'.","In 2016 car insurer Admiral said it intended to use Facebook posts to help it price premiums","However, the Ombudsman ordered Unum to continue paying, with 8 per cent interest as well as £500 compensation, because the customer had been advised by his doctor to stay off work.","In another case, Axa refused to pay a car insurance claim following an accident on the basis that the customer had failed to mention that her vehicle had been modified.","The woman claimed she hadn't disclosed the alterations because she didn't know about them.","But Axa discovered posts on a social media website where the woman's family discussed the car in great detail. It said this was proof that the woman should have known that the vehicle had undergone major changes — and the Ombudsman took the insurer's side.","Insurers are also looking at ways they can use social media to work out how much customers should pay.","In 2016 car insurer Admiral said it intended to use Facebook posts to help it price premiums. It planned to use techniques pioneered by scientists which involve analysing customers' language for clues as to whether or not someone is a good risk.","The theory is customers who write short, concrete sentences, make lists or use exact mentions of time are likely to be conscientious and therefore a safe driver.","Repeated use of exclamation marks, on the other hand, could indicate that someone was over-confident and so more likely to speed. The project ran into trouble after Facebook barred the firm from using people's data in this way.","Admiral has since launched First Car Quote, an insurer for new motorists who are typically charged much higher premiums.","Customers must sign into the website via their Facebook profile to get a quote. They will then receive details of their policy through Facebook's private messaging service. Admiral told Money Mail that the only personal data it uses is your name, email address and date of birth.","It says that signing in through Facebook speeds up the application process as this information is automatically filled in.","A spokesman for First Car Quote says: 'We don't have access to any other customer Facebook data. We do not use personality quizzes nor do we use data scoring cookies on our website to set prices for customers.'","However, in First Car Quote's privacy policy it states that customers are agreeing to the firm collecting 'lifestyle and other behavioural information' about them.","Social media credit scoring","Experts say lenders and brokers are increasingly looking at homebuyers' social media profiles — particularly new borrowers with a limited credit history.","Ray Boulger, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, says: 'First-time buyers are in a tricky situation because their credit rating is often low, simply because they haven't had a mortgage before.","'This is when a lender is most likely to turn to other sources to judge their eligibility and check what kind of lifestyle they lead.'","Experts say lenders and brokers are increasingly looking at homebuyers' social media profiles — particularly new borrowers with a limited credit history","If you claim to spend a modest amount of money on holidays, but post pictures from expensive trips overseas you could find you're turned down. One borrower was recently turned down because of how he described his job on LinkedIn.","He had been self-employed for more than a decade and made a minor change to his profile saying he had stopped freelancing for an agency.","The lender spotted the change and became suspicious that this meant the borrower had worked on staff for the agency and had only just become self-employed. It refused the loan application, despite evidence that the borrower still had a steady income.","Frazer Horton, managing director of mortgage broker Edward Frazer, says: 'I find this a very worrying development. LinkedIn is effectively a dating site for people looking for work or trying to 'big up' their careers. Information is presented in such a way as to drum up business.","'To give the information anything other than the most passing regard or to draw the conclusions that the lender has seems ludicrous.'","The taxman is watching too","HM Revenue & Customs inspectors regularly snoop on social media websites to check people are paying the correct amount of tax.","They are looking for people whose lifestyles do not match their declared earnings.","If they see someone who claims to be on a low income posting pictures of flashy cars or luxury holidays, it raises a red flag.","Fiona Fernie, a tax partner at London accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, says one of her clients was questioned by the taxman after posting pictures of a Ferrari parked in their driveway.","In fact, the client had inherited — not bought — the car and planned to sell it because they couldn't afford the cost of upkeep.","Fiona says tax inspectors are most interested in the two main indicators of wealth — the value of someone's house and their car.","Anything the taxman finds is plugged into HMRC's database, Connect, which contains data about you from government records, banks and building societies, the Land Registry and DVLA details.","Ms Fernie says that misinformation posted online can be damaging.","She had one client who was named in a local newspaper which said they had been living in the UK for decades.","In fact, they had only recently returned after living abroad. HMRC grilled the client to check they hadn't actually been living in the UK and failed to declare earnings.","In 2016, HMRC gained powers to spy on eBay and Airbnb customers' accounts to find out what they buy and sell. It means investigators can get users' names, addresses and bank account numbers.","If someone is selling the odd piece of second-hand furniture, the taxman will pay no notice. But if you are trading full-time, it will check whether your earnings have been declared. HMRC can also see customers' online shopping and sales receipts with payment firms such as PayPal and Worldpay.","Dawn Register, a tax partner at BDO, says HMRC uses Google Earth to spy on properties to check if you're building on your property.","'If you've forked out for a massive extension but are declaring a low income, that'll raise a red flag. And if you've built a granny flat, they could ask why you're not declaring a rental income,' she says.","A spokesman for the taxman says: 'HMRC collects and analyses data from a range of sources to understand and manage risks to the tax system. Sometimes this includes the use of publicly available data.'","HMRC adds that while it often checks the social media profiles of people whose tax affairs they are looking into, this information would not be the starting point of any investigation."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Facebook has already suspended Cambridge Analytica and parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories for violating the site's Terms of Service relating to the collection and retention of data.","It is believed Cambridge Analytica acquired user data that was obtained via an unauthorized source, providing the firm an unfair advantage compared to other teams in the political analytics field. Cambridge Analytica claims it is innocent, that it received Facebook data in good faith from another firm, that it deleted the data once procedural irregularities were found, and the data in question was not used in services provided to the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.","According to a post by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the researcher at the center of the scandal identified as Aleksandr Kogan had accessed the data of 300,000 Facebook users and millions of their friends by creating a personality quiz in 2013, something apps were prevented from doing in an update the following year. Kogan is alleged to have shared the data with Cambridge Analytica in 2015, with media reports also claiming Cambridge Analytica failed to delete the data despite assuring Facebook it had done so.","The FTC statement emphasizes that \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements.\" The investigation is specifically attempting to clarify whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree it agreed to, following the discovery user data was previously provided to Cambridge Analytica without the prior knowledge of Facebook users.","Under the decree, Facebook agreed to acquire the user's consent for changes to privacy settings, to settle federal charges it had deceived users, and ended up sharing more personal data than users would have intended. If the FTC determines Facebook violated the consent decree terms, it could face thousands of dollars in daily fines per violation.","Since the first wave of reports on the privacy issue surfaced, Facebook has seen its stock value drop as well as demands by lawmakers in both the US and the UK to explain what happened. In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office is also performing its own on-site investigation in Cambridge Analytica's London office.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded to the revelations by vowing to better safeguard users' data in the future. The social network will investigate apps that had access to large quantities of data before the changes in 2014, restrict developers' ability to access the data, and add a tool in the top of all users' Newsfeed to show apps they had used and to revoke permission for apps to use their data.","At the China Development Forum over the weekend, Apple CEO Tim Cook weighed in on the affair, calling for stricter rules for what companies can do with harvested information. \"The ability of anyone to know what you've been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life - from my own point of view it shouldn't exist,\" Cook advised."],"isopubdate":""}

If you’re still keen on using Facebook, though, you might want to access it through Mozilla’s Firefox browser, with the organization’s new extension in tow.","The Facebook Container extension essentially isolates your identity on the social network from other sites that use third-party cookies. That means that if you’ve logged into Facebook and then visited a separate site, the company won’t be able to track your web activity and associate it with your profile.","So, for example, Facebook won’t be able to tell which site you enjoy browsing for news, just because you clicked on a link or opened up the news site in a separate tab; if the site uses cookies and you didn’t have the extension installed, Facebook would be able to build up a profile about you which includes your preference for this news site.","Once you’ve got the extension installed, it’ll first delete all your Facebook cookies in Firefox. The next time you visit the social network’s site, it’ll load in a blue-colored tab (which means you’re browsing in a container) and function as normal – except that if you navigate to a non-Facebook site, that page will load outside of the container.","It’s worth noting that sites which require a Facebook account for registering or logging in may not work properly because of the extension; the same goes for embedded Facebook comments on articles. But if you value the privacy of your data, that’s a small price to pay.","Of course, this isn’t going to stop Facebook from collecting or selling data about you through its site and from other sources where it’s connected to your account – but it’s a great start towards regaining control over your data."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Sunday’s crash was believed to be the first fatality in any testing program involving autonomous vehicles.“In all, 50 manufacturers have secured permits from California regulators to test autonomous cars in that state with safety chaperones behind the wheel.”","Nick Note: Are we moving too quickly? The head of Carnegie Mellon University's self-driving laboratory told Axios that the technology is not there yet. “This isn't like a bug with your phone. People can get killed.” Americans differ dramatically and strongly concerning driverless technology. Nearly six-in-ten Americans say they would not want to ride in a driverless vehicle. The Governors Highway Safety Association estimates that nearly 6,000 pedestrians were killed in motor crashes in the U.S. in 2017. Risk always permeates innovation at various levels, but when innovation endangers communities, potential ground-breaking revolutions turn into unnecessary tragedies. Innovation and safety are not mutually exclusive but they should be carefully weighed (Ezekiel 4, Phil. 2:3, 1 Chron. 21).","“Facebook hired auditors to determine whether a political intelligence firm it said had improper access of up to 50 million personal profiles on the social network has deleted that data.\n“As its stock fell on calls by lawmakers for stricter regulations, the social network said it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign-aligned firm… The loss dropped Facebook's market cap more than $36 billion to $501.3 billion.”","Nick Note: This largely was a result of news that broke Friday when Facebook suspended a firm for improper utilization of data. Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by, among others, President Trump’s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users. As we continue to see, Facebook now functions as more than a place where you connect with new friends and semi-stalk old friends. Niall Ferguson, in a must read feature in The Spectator, compared the advent of the printing press to our social media connected world. Ferguson writes: “A defining feature of social networks (as in the Reformation) is their tendency to divide rather than unite.” He goes on to write: “Now, as then, newly empowered networks have led to polarisation, not harmony… networks have eroded territorial sovereignty, weakening the established structures of political authority.” I know I sound like a broken and biased record, but we are in desperate need of intermediary institutions that are free from partisanship, serious about making peace, and hold a desire to strengthen our communities. This institution is the church, a group of people that relentlessly make peace and understand they are citizens of another kingdom that seek to reconcile both man to God and to each other (Heb. 12:14, 2. Cor. 5:15-20, Phil. 3:20). In our age of fragmented distrust, our country needs a united body of believers.","“Evangelicals were most likely to heed recommendations by top leaders from recent administrations; nearly half (49%) said Trump’s endorsement would make them more likely to vote for a particular candidate, more than any other figure… Vice President Mike Pence (46%), President George W. Bush (43%)...\n“Half or more said endorsements by Hillary Clinton (54%), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (50%), or President Bill Clinton (50%) would make them less likely to support a candidate…\n“Fellow entertainers Beyoncé and Ellen also fell among evangelicals’ 10 most damaging endorsements. Only about 1 in 5 evangelicals cares what The Rock had to say either way; celebrities such as Tom Brady, LeBron James, Mark Zuckerberg, and Taylor Swift also fell relatively low on their lists.”","Nick Note: So Now We Got Bad Blood? Apparently so, Taylor Swift. In an unsurprising twist, evangelicals largely don’t trust the woman who sings Drunk in Love or the actor who continually asks if we smell what he is cooking. How do you determine who to trust? Research indicates that trust grows from actions. If a person acts in a way that moves toward a perceived good end, trust grows. If they act against that end, mistrust develops. In the Scriptures, notice the narrative of Rehoboam concerning trust (1 Kings 12). While we should not completely distrust others, we should completely trust in the Lord (Psalm 20:7). We know he acts in our best interests at all times (Jer. 29:11, Phil. 2:12-13). Now Tom Brady on the other hand…","“The suicide rate for white children and teens between 10 and 17 was up 70% between 2006 and 2016, the latest data analysis available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n“A study of pediatric hospitals found admissions of patients ages 5 to 17 for suicidal thoughts and actions more than doubled from 2008 to 2015. The group at highest risk for suicide are white males between 14 and 21.\n“Experts and teens cite myriad reasons, including spotty mental health screening, poor access to mental health services and resistance among young men and people of color to admit they have a problem and seek care.”","Nick Note: In David Foster Wallace’s short story “The Depressed Person,” he noted the “emotional isolation that rendered the depressed person’s every waking hour an indescribable hell on earth.” His struggle with depression was well-known, however he sought to use his writing to help readers “become less alone inside… I want to author things that both restructure worlds and make living people feel stuff.” Numbness more than sadness characterizes depression which can lead to thoughts of suicide. A number of characters in the biblical narrative suffered through suicidal symptoms but ultimately decided that, though they may not see the hand of God in their lives, they could trust his heart with their lives. God walks with us through the valley of the shadow of death (Psalm 23:4). Jesus weeps as we weep (John 11:35). He experienced every pain we feel (Hebrews 4:15). He is not absent in our sufferings but is sympathetically present with us in the sufferings (Psalm 34:18, Acts 16:25–26).","“According to Reuters, a study commissioned by the National Coffee Association surveyed 3,000 Americans about their coffee drinking habits. The survey found that 64 percent of Americans drink a cup of coffee every day, up from 62 percent in 2017, and the highest percentage since 2012.\n“79 percent of participants said that they had brewed a cup of coffee at home the previous day, while only 36 of people said they had bought a coffee from an outside location.”","“Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.\n“Even when children grow up next to each other with parents who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of America. And the gaps only worsen in the kind of neighborhoods that promise low poverty and good schools.\n“According to the study, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, income inequality between blacks and whites is driven entirely by what is happening among these boys and the men they become.”","Nick Note: The mere word ‘racism’ swings our thoughts either into a defensive posture or offensive attack. Current research shows that the vast majority of Americans have already made up their mind on the issue, and have thus conceived of a plan for how they will respond to this divisive subject. Racism functions on both an individual and systemic level. The individual level is best illustrated with one individual degrading another through words or actions. Less identifiable and arguably more detrimental is systemic racism. This type of racism refers to inequalities built into an organization or system. Perpetuating discrimination and prejudice against a group of individuals, systemic racism gives partiality to one group to the detriment and degradation of the others. So when we read that 21 percent of black boys who grew up well-off became poor as adults while 39 percent of white boys remained rich, does this indicate a problem? Yesterday, Christian artist Andrew Peterson realized he unknowingly perpetuated a problem in his latest music video. But upon realizing his mistake, he asked for forgiveness. “And I truly believe that all the darkness—even my own—won’t stop the light from getting through. I do.” Racism robs people of their dignity and God of his glory (Gal. 3:26-28, Eph. 3:8-10, Isaiah 42:8)."],"isopubdate":""}

(TNS)","If you were surprised to learn that Facebook simply handed out the personal data of more than 50 million users — data that ended up in the hands of Donald Trump's presidential campaign — you have every reason to feel bushwhacked.","Facebook gives its service away worldwide in return for people posting details of their lives. We all know that going in.","Advertisement","But the Menlo Park company also emphasizes in its terms of service that \"you own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared.\"","The implication is clear (or should be): You're in the driver's seat. If you don't want your info shared with others, it won't be.","The reality is: Your data belong to Facebook, and the company will enrich itself by doing with it whatever it pleases.","\"All Facebook users have to understand that the reason that the firm is so profitable is because our data is gold, and we're giving it away for free,\" said Scott J. Shackelford, an associate business professor at Indiana University focusing on cybersecurity law and policy.","\"Reasonable users of the service need to understand this fact, and not be surprised when their data are gleaned and repackaged for an array of purposes,\" he told me.","Facebook has drawn the attention of lawmakers in the United States and Europe after reports surfaced that the company provided access to the personal data of tens of millions of users to an academic researcher, who in turn made the information available to others, including a company called Cambridge Analytica.","That company, backed by former Trump aide and right-wing provocateur Steve Bannon, specializes in data mining for conservative political purposes.","Facebook said it was suspending access to Cambridge Analytica and its parent, Strategic Communication Laboratories. It also stressed that the release of user data wasn't a security breach.","\"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" the company said.","Well, yeah. However, that's hardly the whole story.","A University of Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan wanted to build a database of personality profiles. Kogan persuaded around 270,000 people to fill out a survey in an app installed in their Facebook accounts.","That app, in turn, gave Kogan access to the survey takers' Facebook friends, which rapidly expanded the universe of available data to over 50 million people. Information included people's likes and dislikes, where they live, what they do for a living and how much education they'd received.","All of that apparently was kosher in Facebook's eyes. Where Kogan went astray was in subsequently making the info available for political purposes to Cambridge Analytica.","\"Facebook's terms of service are quite obviously of no value to consumers,\" said Sam Lester, consumer privacy fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C. \"Consumers had no knowledge that a controversial data mining firm was accessing their personal data.\"","Advertisement","Although the company's terms of service are emphatic that Facebook users \"own\" the info they post, a dive into Facebook's separate data policy takes a broader view.","It says information will be shared with business partners and with entities \"conducting academic research and surveys.\" That's the back door that Kogan climbed through.","\"These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this data policy and the agreements we enter into with them,\" Facebook says. But the Cambridge Analytica case shows that once information gets into the wild, there are few effective means of limiting where it goes.","Facebook says that when it found out in 2015 about Cambridge Analytica using the data, it demanded the company delete all the files. Cambridge Analytica says it duly deleted the data two years ago, once it learned that Facebook wasn't pleased.","But it's not like anyone from Facebook went to Cambridge's office and made sure the data had been erased. According to the New York Times and the Observer of London, the data played a role in Trump's digital election endeavors.","Privacy experts say social-media users need to be clear-eyed about what these companies are doing. They're in the business of making money, and they do this by treating users' self-posted information as a commodity.","Regardless of what a company's privacy policy may say, it's a certainty that people's information will be bought and sold for commercial or political purposes.","\"Users should understand that if they want to protect their personal data they should not share it with a company that makes money off their users' information and attention,\" said Susan Freiwald, a law professor at the University of San Francisco.","\"Even if it were not Facebook's intent to put users' personal information at risk, merely collecting and storing it turns it into a honeypot that is attractive to bad actors,\" she observed.","Always go into the privacy settings of an online service or app and limit, as best as you can, how much your data will be shared. Keep in mind that you can't completely keep your information under wraps — these companies aren't charities, after all.","Beyond that, privacy experts say current law lags behind technological capabilities, and it's up to lawmakers to pass new safeguards addressing data sharing.","\"There are simply no constraints,\" said Kathryn Montgomery, a communications professor at American University. \"These corporations can do with our data whatever they please, without telling us.\"","She called Facebook's provision about data sharing with academics and survey takers \"a huge loophole.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior.

A Target employee inadvertently clicked on a phishing email; soon after, the personal details of over a third of all American adults were released into the wild — to be used in ways that were certainly never intended when those adults gave the data to Target.","Target got slammed for it. People stopped shopping there that Christmas. Their stock price tanked. Their CEO got fired.","As bad as this was, it is absolutely child’s play compared to the racket that Facebook was running at exactly the same time.","There’s a very good reason that Facebook is the fastest growing advertising business in the world. It’s because it has the largest, most detailed and most granular user data on the planet. It’s also incredibly personal, and will reveal a lot about your life to anyone who has access to it. And yet all the way up until April 2015, Facebook was giving all that data away to its developers that were using the Graph API.","If you were one of these developers, and you got a user to give you access to their Facebook account (say, to log in or to use your app), you got a data payout that is unlikely ever to be replicated in history. It wasn’t just the user’s data — but all the data of that user’s friends on Facebook.","Back in 2014, the median number of friends a Facebook user had was 200. It’s been widely reported that Cambridge Analytica only needed to get 270,000 users in order to snare a total of ~50M people’s data. That would suggest about a 1 to 185 ratio (which is in the ballpark of that 200 median friends number).","Now, assuming that ratio is linear (it almost certainly isn’t due to some users being highly connected, others much less so; there are likely to be “pockets” in countries and languages, etc — but it’s helpful as an assumption to do the math) how many unique users would you as a developer need to get, to get every Facebook user on the platform?","1.5 billion users, at a 1:185 ratio = 8 million downloads. That’s right — 8 million downloads and you’ve got the entire platform.","But the kicker is, you don’t even need to have achieved that.","Facebook was so kind as to offer up each user’s unique Facebook User_ID when it returned these data requests. This means that all the data from all the different apps, quizzes and games can be immediately and instantly recombined into one massive database… just like Facebook’s!","In other words: one app developer didn’t even need to create the killer app that got 8M downloads to get the profiles of Facebook’s entire userbase. In fact, it’s entirely conceivable that you collected it all from others and used Facebook’s User_ID as the primary key to piece it all together (hence Parakilas’s “black market” comment above).","And let’s not doubt how many versions of this data Facebook handed out. Do you remember all those annoying Facebook game requests you got from friends? They weren’t just annoying notifications; those friends of yours were (inadvertently) giving away your data, too.","To give a sense of how many apps were out there doing this: here’s an AdWeek article back in 2012, quoting Facebook as saying there were 9 million apps and websites integrated with Facebook. And 2012 was three years before Facebook cut off API access to pulling this kind of data.","And to even further compound the problem: a whole bunch of startups were built relying on access to graph data. When Facebook cut off API access… those companies died. This TechCrunch article names but a few: JobFusion, CareerSonar, Jobs With Friends, adzuna Connect.","Just as we worry about nukes going missing when states fail, how many of those companies or websites failed, and then sold or “lost” all that data that had been collected? (And that’s quite obviously putting aside the fact it’s a lot easier to replicate data than it is a nuclear warhead). This is not to accuse any of those companies named above of wrongdoing — I have no knowledge of what happened to the data when they shut down.","I’m going to go out on a limb and say that multiple entities have subsequently hit the data equivalent of winning the lottery: they’ve hoovered up the user profiles of something approaching 100% of people on Facebook at the time that Facebook finally turned off v1 of their Graph API, which was back in April 2015.","This equates to roughly 1.5 billion profiles.","And we’re obviously not just talking about your name and your email address. Think about the kind of damage someone with ill-intent could do to you if they had all of this:","At least Target had the decency to attempt to secure their user data from those who wanted to use it in ways that were never intended it when it was given to them. Facebook didn’t even bother. They just gave it away.","But this begs another question: why? Why on earth was Facebook giving away what amounts to the crown jewels for an advertising business: the incredibly valuable user data that allows advertisers to target? If you’re the fastest growing advertising business in the world, it makes no sense.","I don’t believe it was obliviousness to the impact that it might have — although Zuckerberg has demonstrated plenty of that over the years.","Nor do I think it was inept management — though people do forget how strategically inept Facebook was until it was dragged, kicking and screaming, into the mobile era.","The biggest reason?","For the longest period of time, Facebook was an advertising business that dreamed of being something else other than an advertising business. It wanted to be a platform.","It was probably driven in part by the fact that, in tech, advertising is a pretty dirty business. And a platform? That’s the gold standard.","And if those are the grand illusions that you’ve got, it’s not your proprietary data that you view as the secret to your success (which you only need to advertise). Instead, it’s developers, and getting them to build on top of your precious platform.","And so began the great five year Facebook data giveaway to developers:","If you build your apps on our platform, we’ll give you more user data than you could possibly imagine.","And that’s what happened. As Ben Thompson wrote on Stratechery as far back as 2013, Facebook was so focused on being a platform rather than being an advertising business that it almost missed the boat on mobile. The shift to mobile gave Facebook no choice but to abandon its platform pretensions, and effectively saved the company from itself.","And yet, it seems, Facebook hasn’t entirely escaped the ghost of these past missteps. The complaint that advertising is at the root of so many of the problems tech faces today is not without merit. Ironically enough, however, it might be Facebook’s past resistance to its advertising-based business model that speeds the tech industry towards its regulatory reckoning.","It’s easy to look at Target and bemoan an old-world company that was unprepared for the Internet. Facebook, though, shows that the issue is not the Internet, per se, it’s the danger that comes from a company operating where it shouldn’t.

Mozilla indicated, however, that it had no plans to decommission Persona and would maintain some level of involvement such as in maintenance and reviewing pull requests.[8]","Persona was inspired by the VerifiedEmailProtocol[10][11] which is now known as the BrowserID protocol.[12] It uses any user email address to identify its owner. This protocol involves the browser, an identity provider, and any compliant website.","The browser stores a list of user verified email addresses (certificates issued by the identity providers), and demonstrates the user's ownership of the addresses to the website using cryptographic proof.","The certificates must be renewed every 24 hours by logging into the identity provider (which will usually mean entering the email and a password in a Web form on the identity provider's site). Once done, they will be usable for authenticating to web sites with the same browser for the rest of the day, without entering passwords again (single sign-on).","The decentralization aspects of the protocol reside in the theoretical support of any identity provider service, while in practice it seems to rely mainly on Mozilla's servers currently (which may in turn delegate email address verification, see identity bridging below). However, even if the protocol heavily relies on a central identity provider, this central actor only knows when browsers renew certificates, and cannot in principle monitor where the certificates will be used.","Mozilla announced \"identity bridging\" support for Persona in July, 2013. As they describe on their blog:","\"Traditionally ... Mozilla would send you an email and ask you to click on the confirmation link it contained. With Identity Bridging, Persona learned a new trick; instead of sending confirmation emails, Persona can ask you to verify your identity via your email provider’s existing OpenID or OAuth gateway.\"[13]","This announcement included support for existing users of the Yahoo Mail service. In August 2013, Mozilla announced support for Identity Bridging with all Gmail accounts. They wrote in this additional announcement that \"combined with our Identity Bridge for Yahoo, Persona now natively supports more than 700,000,000 active email users. That covers roughly 60–80% of people on most North American websites.\"[14]"],"isopubdate":""}

By exploiting the fact that pre-4.1 Android permissions could be requested by apps on the Play Store up until last year, and that those earlier permissions automatically granted call and SMS access together with requests to access contacts, Facebook was able to collect and store metadata associated with each from those that gave the app those permissions.","This is on the heels of the larger Cambridge Analytica Facebook scandal—which we haven't really covered because, up until now, it hasn't really applied to Android specifically. The much-abridged version is that a company called Cambridge Analytica reportedly harvested data from some 50 million Facebook users, against Facebook's terms of service. Some of that data was ostensibly deleted after Facebook privately contacted the company a couple years ago, but independent audits are verifying that as we speak in the face of allegations that it might have been used to influence recent elections.","Within that lens, you can see how Facebook's collection of SMS and call data over recent years could be a concern. The privacy implications of Facebook having that information are sketchy enough, but if unsupervised third parties like Cambridge Analytica had access to it, it could be in anyone's hands.","Ars Technica's Sean Gallagher was able to confirm, in exploring the contents of his own Facebook data archive, that call and SMS data from 2015 and 2016 was present. Others have confirmed the presence of that data up until October 2017, the approximate date at which Google retired support for pre-4.1 APIs for apps in the Play Store.","If you're concerned, you might want to take a look at your own Facebook data to see what the company might have collected. It also includes information about which third party advertisers Facebook may have shared/sold it to. Allegedly you can even delete that data, though Ars reports information was still present in a downloaded archive after deletion, so YMMV.","Facebook posted a bit of company news today in response to the allegations it stored call and messaging metadata. The company reiterated that it wasn't saving the actual content of calls or SMS/MMS messages—something neither Ars Technica nor we claimed, but presumably other outlets did.","It also further expanded precisely how that metadata was being collected. Turns out, it may not have been from the Facebook app. It's actually a part of Facebook Lite and Messenger (and users can opt out here and here, respectively). Facebook considers the data collection opt-in since the apps in question directly ask if you'd like to upload that information during setup.","That means that Facebook likely wasn't trying to hide the collection of that information behind older Android API levels, as they were initially accused of. Each app that requests that data makes those requests clear, as you can see just below in Facebook's screenshot of the Messenger setup process.","So, while Facebook has been collecting that metadata for years (since 2015, according to Facebook), the mechanism behind it should probably have been transparent to users of the service, and the company was not abusing older API levels to get it.","Those that remain worried can delete the information that was uploaded via the page here.","“He gazed up at the enormous face.

As part of the settlement, Lilly will take appropriate security measures to protect consumers' privacy.","\"Even the unintentional release of sensitive medical information is a serious breach of consumers' trust,\" said J. Howard Beales, III, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"Companies that obtain sensitive information in exchange for a promise to keep it confidential must take appropriate steps to ensure the security of that information.\"","Lilly, a pharmaceutical company based in Indiana, manufactures, markets, and sells several drugs, including the anti-depressant medication Prozac. Lilly operates the Prozac.com Web site, which the company promotes as \"Your Guide to Evaluating and Recovering from Depression.\" Several of Lilly's Web sites, including www.prozac.com and www.lilly.com, collect personal information from visitors. From March 15, 2000 until June 22, 2001, Lilly offered to consumers the \"Medi-messenger\" e-mail reminder service. Consumers who used Medi-messenger could design and receive personal e-mail messages to remind them to take or refill their medication. Once a consumer registered for Medi-messenger, the reminder messages were automatically e-mailed from Lilly to the subscriber at the e-mail address she or he had provided, and according to the subscriber's requested schedule. These reminders were individualized e-mails and did not identify any other subscribers to the service.","On June 27, 2001, a Lilly employee created a new computer program to access Medi-messenger subscribers' e-mail addresses and sent them an e-mail message announcing the termination of the Medi-messenger service. The June 27th e-mail message included all of the recipients' e-mail addresses within the \"To:\" line of the message, thereby unintentionally disclosing to each individual subscriber the e-mail addresses of all 669 Medi-messenger subscribers.","According to the FTC's complaint, Lilly claimed that it employs measures and takes steps appropriate under the circumstances to maintain and protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal information obtained from or about consumers through its Prozac.com and Lilly.com Web sites. For example, Lilly's privacy policies included statements such as, \"Eli Lilly and Company respects the privacy of visitors to its Web sites, and we feel it is important to maintain our guests' privacy as they take advantage of this resource.\"","The FTC complaint alleges that Lilly's claim of privacy and confidentiality was deceptive because Lilly failed to maintain or implement internal measures appropriate under the circumstances to protect sensitive consumer information, which led to the company's unintentional June 27th disclosure of Medi-messenger subscribers' personal information (i.e., e-mail addresses). In fact, according to the complaint, Lilly failed to: provide appropriate training for its employees regarding consumer privacy and information security; provide appropriate oversight and assistance for the employee who sent out the e-mail, who had no prior experience in creating, testing, or implementing the computer program used; and implement appropriate checks and controls on the process, such as reviewing the computer program with experienced personnel and pretesting the program internally before sending out the e-mail. Lilly's failure to implement appropriate measures also violated a number of its own written security procedures.","The proposed settlement would bar misrepresentations about the extent to which Lilly maintains and protects the privacy or confidentiality of any personal information collected from or about consumers. Additionally, Lilly would be required to establish and maintain a four-stage information security program designed to establish and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumers' personal information against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to its security, confidentiality, or integrity, and to protect such information against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Specifically, Lilly would be required to:","Designate appropriate personnel to coordinate and oversee the program;","Identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal information, including any such risks posed by lack of training, and to address these risks in each relevant area of its operations, whether performed by employees or agents, including: (i) management and training of personnel; (ii) information systems for the processing, storage, transmission, or disposal of personal information; and (iii) prevention and response to attacks, intrusions, unauthorized access, or other information systems failures;","Conduct an annual written review by qualified persons, within ninety (90) days after the date of service of the order and yearly thereafter, which shall monitor and document compliance with the program, evaluate the program's effectiveness, and recommend changes to it; and","Adjust the program in light of any findings and recommendations resulting from reviews or ongoing monitoring, and in light of any material changes to Lilly's operations that affect the program.","Lilly's security breach was the subject of a July 2001 petition from the American Civil Liberties Union requesting that the FTC investigate and take appropriate action to remedy the breach.","The Commission vote to accept the proposed settlement was 5-0.

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” she said on Twitter. “I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say ‘trust us.’ Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.”","But much of the online outrage came after multiple Facebook executives took to Twitter to respond to the news reports, insisting the incident was not a “data breach.”","“This was unequivocally not a date breach,” longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth tweeted. “People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen and hacked.”","In a series of tweets that have since been deleted, Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, insisted that although user’s personal information may have been misused, it wasn’t retroactively a “breach.”","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a “breach” under any reasonable definition of the term,” Stamos tweeted. “We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it.”","Twitter users were not satisfied with that response — many accused the executives of deliberately missing the point by focusing on semantics.","“It amazes me that [the Facebook executives] are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that’s all they have left,” Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about tech companies’ use of data, told Reuters. “The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices and the picture is not pretty.”"],"isopubdate":""}

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","In the report, the Times cast the data access error as a “breach” and revealed that Cambridge Analytica still had access to the data.","It continued:","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","More damning for the company is that it knew about the breach as early as 2015, but took only limited action to resolve the problem.","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","The company claims that it wasn’t breached, and that while it has suspended Cambridge Analytica from its service, the social giant is not at fault. Facebook contends that its technology worked exactly how Facebook built it to work, but that bad actors, like Cambridge Analytica, violated the company’s terms of service.","On the other hand, Facebook has since changed those terms of service to cut down on information third parties can collect, essentially admitting that its prior terms weren’t very good.","Executives took to Twitter to counter some of The New York Times’ narrative—but later deleted their tweets.","Recode continued:","Facebook’s Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos, tweeted a lengthy defense of the company, which also included a helpful explanation for how this came about. (He later deleted the tweets, saying he “should have done a better job weighing in,”[…]","“Kogan did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, our use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed. He did, however, misuse that data after he gathered it, but that does not retroactively make it a ‘breach.'”","The latest scandal has prompted some to question Facebook higher-ups’ intentions and competence.","Whether it doesn’t see the disasters coming, makes a calculated gamble that the growth or mission benefits of something will far outweigh the risks, or purposefully makes a dangerous decision while obscuring the consequences, Facebook is responsible for its significant shortcomings. The company has historically cut corners in pursuit of ubiquity that left it, potentially knowingly, vulnerable to exploitation.","Combatting its coverage in the media hasn’t helped its case.","TechCrunch continued:","And increasingly, Facebook is going to lengths to fight the news cycle surrounding its controversies instead of owning up early and getting to work. Facebook knew about Cambridge Analytica’s data policy violations since at least August 2016, but did nothing but send a legal notice to delete the information. It only suspended the Facebook accounts of Cambridge Analytica and other guilty parties and announced the move this week in hopes of muting forthcoming New York Times and Guardian articles about the issue (articles which it also tried to prevent from running via legal threats.) And since, representatives of the company have quibbled with reporters over Twitter, describing the data misuse as a “breach” instead of explaining why it didn’t inform the public about it for years.","TechCrunch listed other Facebook snafus, reinforcing its depiction of a company facing a public reckoning.","Facebook might have kept the story alive by moving to block whistleblower Christopher Wylie.","His attorney, Tamsin Allen, has stated that Facebook took a two-faced approach to Wylie’s revelations. It “privately welcomed” Wylie’s help, Allen said, but publicly suspended his account and criticized him. That was indicative of a company focused more on “damage limitation” than sincerely addressing the problem at hand, according to the attorney. We’ve asked Facebook for its response, but the accusations certainly don’t help its case.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","As the charges mount, fewer people are buying Facebook’s attempts to brush off criticism.","Facebook tried to downplay the story as The New York Times was preparing its report and then attempted to preempt the news with its own press release. Reporters did not appreciate the move."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

No matter how bad the Cambridge Analytica scandal gets Zuckerberg is almost certainly staying put. That’s because when it comes to whether Zuckerberg stays or goes, he himself has the final say. There’s no way to appeal to the company’s board, because for all intents and purposes, the board works for him.","Zuckerberg’s power comes from Facebook’s stock structure","Zuckerberg’s unassailable position is due to the way Facebook’s ownership is structured. Like several other tech companies, including Google and Snap, the social networking giant has more than one class of stock. Although all shares represent an equal stake in the company, one set — Facebook’s Class B stock — has 10 times more voting power than the other.","Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has disproportionate control over his company, thanks to its multiclass stock structure.\nMichael Kovac/Getty Images for Vanity Fair","Thanks in large part to his ownership of more than 75% of Facebook’s Class B shares, Zuckerberg has more than half of the voting power at Facebook. That essentially gives him control over the company. He can vote directors in and out, vote down shareholder proposals urging reforms, veto merger proposals, and quash any effort to topple him — all by himself.","That structure was designed to protect Zuckerberg and his executive team from the often short-terms concerns of everyday shareholders so he could concentrate on building Facebook’s business for the long term. That’s a nice weapon to repulse unwanted meddling from malicious Wall Street forces that don’t have the company’s best interest at heart. But as the world is discovering now, when a company acquires the level of power that Facebook has, the implications of a dual-class stock structure stretch far beyond the firm’s financial stakeholders.","If Zuckerberg doesn’t want to be bothered with something, you really can’t force him to care.","Dual-class stock structures can be beneficial — and controversial","Supporters of such structures can point to real-world situations where they’ve proven important, perhaps even crucial. Ford’s dual-class stock arguably helped it survive the Great Recession without going into bankruptcy, unlike General Motors and Chrysler. The New York Times’ dual-class structure arguably allowed it to better weather the downturn that’s decimated other newspaper companies over the last two decades by allowing it to more easily invest in its online and other digital initiatives.","Still, the practice of giving certain insiders outsized control over a company has long been controversial, precisely because it limits the control everyday shareholders can exercise over a company. Dual-class structures also allow the empowered insiders to run the companies for their benefit rather than that of shareholders or the general public.","Zuckerberg’s singular control over Facebook has already drawn criticism. Two years ago, he tried to force through a proposal that would have allowed him to maintain his control over the company even as he sold his shares. He eventually backed away from that proposal, but only after a lawsuit and stiff resistance from other shareholders.","Christopher Wylie, a cofounder of Cambridge Analytica, blew the whistle on its illegitimate harvesting of Facebook data.\nChannel 4 News/YouTube","But now Zuckerberg and his company are under scrutiny for something that’s important to a lot more people than just how he treats other shareholders — namely, how it handles and safeguards the data of its billions of users.","According to Facebook and published reports, Cambridge Analytica, the data firm that worked with Donald Trump’s campaign to target voters, used a Facebook app to illegitimately glean data from some 50 million users of the social network without the knowledge of the vast majority of those users.","Facebook was aware more than two years ago that Cambridge Analytica got its hands on the data, but basically did nothing about it other than asking it to delete the data. It neither followed up to ensure that Cambridge Analytica actually did delete the data nor, apparently, did it warn users that the data firm had gotten access to their data. And it didn’t even publicly acknowledge the data leak until late Friday and apparently only did it then because The Times and the Observer were about to publish reports about it.","Zuckerberg is acting like he did with reports of fake news","Since the leak, Zuckerberg has been nowhere to be seen. His absence from the scene and refusal to accept responsibility for what’s happened are reminiscent of his initial response to reports that Russian-linked groups had exploited Facebook’s network to spread fake news and propaganda in an effort to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Zuckerberg infamously dismissed such concerns.","Facebook’s investors were obviously a bit more concerned than Zuckerberg seems to be showing publicly. Amid worries that regulators are going to step in because Facebook is doing such a poor job of overseeing its network, they sent the company’s stock spiraling downward. It ended the day off 7%.","Zuckerberg is obviously very smart. He’s also done a great job of growing Facebook into the behemoth it is today.","But when you give someone nearly unassailable, king-like powers, what you really want the person to be is wise and mindful of how his or her actions might affect others. Zuckerberg is showing he is neither.","Zuckerberg is smart, but not wise","To the contrary, Zuckerberg seems to have blinders on when it comes to the power Facebook now holds and the responsibility that comes with that power.","Virginia Sen. Mark Warner has been helping lead the Senate’s investigation of the attempt by Russian-linked groups to influence the 2016 election through posts on Facebook and other social networks.\nREUTERS/Kevin Lamarque","The company holds vast amounts of data about its users. The large majority of its users probably have no idea how much data Facebook holds or how that data could be used to manipulate them. Indeed, for the few who likely ever try to take the time to do it, trying to figure out which Facebook-linked apps or services have access to which parts of your personal data on Facebook can be an exercise in frustration.","Yet the company has shown that it wants to collect ever more data on its users and generally do with it as it sees fit. And it obviously felt little compulsion to govern how that data was used by the partners who it gave access to that data.","Likewise, the company’s social network is incredibly powerful both in its ability to disseminate messages — and to control what messages get seen. But Facebook has shown little concern with how the Russian-linked groups abused that power.","Facebook has more than 2 billion users, an unprecedented level of power and influence for a single company. It’s so large that its actions and policies have repercussions for the entire world, even those who are not on Facebook.","And remember, when we say Facebook here, we mean Zuckerberg. Because thanks to the power he holds over the company, Facebook is Zuckerberg and Zuckerberg is Facebook.","To hold Facebook accountable, you’ve got to hold Zuckerberg to account. But Facebook’s dual-class stock is intentionally designed to prevent just that from happening.","Investors might have been OK with that. But society doesn’t need to be.","ADBLOCKER DETECTED!

After making Kogan and Cambridge Analytica promise to delete the data the app had gathered, Facebook received reports (from sources they would not identify) which claimed that not all the data had been deleted – which led the social media giant to delete Cambridge Analytica and parent company SCL’s accounts.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.” –Facebook","Of note, Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz and Ben Carson during the 2016 election before contracting with the Trump campaign. Cruz stopped using CA after their data modeling failed to identify likely supporters.","In response to the ban, Edward Snowden fired off two tweets on Saturday criticizing Facebook, and claimed social media companies were simply “surveillance companies” who engaged in a “successful deception” by rebranding themselves.","Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims. They are accomplices. https://t.co/mRkRKxsBcw","Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as \"surveillance companies.\" Their rebranding as \"social media\" is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.","Snowden isn’t the first big name to call out Silicon Valley companies over their data collection and monitoring practices, or their notorious intersection with the U.S. Government.","In his 2014 book: When Google Met WikiLeaks, Julian Assange describes Google’s close relationship with the NSA and the Pentagon.","Around the same time, Google was becoming involved in a program known as the “Enduring Security Framework” (ESF), which entailed the sharing of information between Silicon Valley tech companies and Pentagon-affiliated agencies “at network speed.” Emails obtained in 2014 under Freedom of Information requests show Schmidt and his fellow Googler Sergey Brin corresponding on first-name terms with NSA chief General Keith Alexander about ESF Reportage on the emails focused on the familiarity in the correspondence: “General Keith . . . so great to see you . . . !” Schmidt wrote. But most reports overlooked a crucial detail. “Your insights as a key member of the Defense Industrial Base,” Alexander wrote to Brin, “are valuable to ensure ESF’s efforts have measurable impact.” –Julian Assange","Kim Dotcom has also opined on social media’s close ties to the government, tweeting in February “Unfortunately all big US Internet companies are in bed with the deep state.

PRISM’s existence was leaked by Edward Snowden before he entered into ongoing asylum in Moscow. Microsoft was the first company to join the PRISM program.","The NSA has the ability to pull any sort of data it likes from these companies, but it claims that it does not try to collect it all. The PRISM program goes above and beyond the existing laws that state companies must comply with government requests for data, as it gives the NSA direct access to each company’s servers — essentially letting the NSA do as it pleases. –The Verge","After PRISM’s existence was leaked by Snowden, the Director of National Intelligence issued a statment which stated that the only people targed by the programs are “outside the United States,” and that the program “does not allow” the targeting of citizens within US borders.","In 2006, Wiredmagazine published evidence from a retired AT&T communications technician, Mark Klein, that revealed a secret room used to “split” internet data at a San Francisco office as part of the NSA’s bulk data collection techniques used on millions of Americans.","During the course of that work, he learned from a co-worker that similar cabins were being installed in other cities, including Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles and San Diego, he said.","The split circuits included traffic from peering links connecting to other internet backbone providers, meaning that AT&T was also diverting traffic routed from its network to or from other domestic and international providers, Klein said. –Wired","The Free Thought Project wants to continue to spread the ideas of peace and freedom while simultaneously teaching people how to operate outside of the establishment systems of control like using cryptocurrency instead of dollars.

So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","(Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”)","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The British company offers data analysis products to its customers, including services that are created to modify audience behavior.","According to the Guardian, the user data was collected via the “thisisyourdigitallife” app, which is essentially a personality quiz. The quiz was created by Dr. Aleksander Kogan, a professor of psychology at Cambridge. The app’s permissions were set such that users who opted in also signed up to share their friends’ data. More than 270 million users were registered and paid for Dr. Kogan’s test. He says that the test was a psychology tool, used to study user behavior. His firm, Global Science Research sold the information to Cambridge Analytica.","The biggest problem with this, of course, is that the 270 million odd participants were not aware that they were selling out their friends, and their friends did not consent to the sharing of their data explicitly. The app seemed to have woven through permissions loopholes in order to collect the information.","How data was collected, allegedly used","Cambridge Analytica has used the Facebook information to exploit millions of profiles, according to Christopher Wylie, a former employee of the data analysis firm. Wylie also says there are numerous models for exploiting information of this kind, and that the basis of the company was basically to analyze and manipulate this data.","The personality quiz app, “thisisyourdigitallife” was specifically programmed to consider the act of opting into the test equivalent to consenting permission to access Facebook account information, and contacts. Friends who had set their privacy settings to allow sharing in a friend’s app were completely open to the tactic and had no real way of limiting the information that could be shared.","The information gained from this Facebook app was allegedly used to sway political behavior in the most recent US presidential race and the Brexit vote in the UK. Cambridge Analytica denies that the data was used in these ways.","“Thisisyourdigitallife” was removed from Facebook in 2015, but by then the damage had been done. When Facebook discovered what was being done with that data, in 2015, they demanded the destruction of that data. Cambridge Analytica said they had complied. According to the New York Times, though, the data is still very much in existence.","Cambridge Analytica also denies that they broke any of Facebook’s privacy rules, which may be technically true. This has opened the door for many to call for better oversight of social media platforms. Some are urging Facebook to update its policies and increase transparency in the way that permissions are granted. While security experts view this fiasco as proof that boundaries need to be set for third-party access on social media, Facebook claims that they were simply misled by Cambridge Analytica.","Chief security officer Alex Stamos said via Twitter that Dr. Kogan lied about how user data would be used in reference to the personality quiz and that as soon as they found out that the data had not been destroyed, Facebook began aggressively and actively pursuing its destruction. Stamos also clarifies multiple times that this incident does not qualify as a “breach,” but does grant that it was a violation of trust.","Lawmakers respond","The Trump and Cruz campaigns deny any use of the data, although both had contracted Cambridge Analytica for their races. The Trump camp specifically states that the RNC was used to obtain voter data, not Cambridge Analytica.","Regardless of whether the incident was a breach of policy or just shady behavior on the part of Cambridge Analytica, British and US lawmakers have been harsh on Facebook. Many have berated the company for not informing users about the data that Cambridge Analytica had, or how it was being used. There should have been notifications and red flags along the way, rather than the carte blanche granted via friends’ permission settings. Others demand a better answer from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, as the company has been suspiciously quiet about the whole affair.","Republican Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, specifically called out Zuckerberg, saying that he needs to take responsibility for the data misuse, and “stop hiding behind his Facebook page.” Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts will be launching an investigation into the matter. In the UK, Damian Collins has called out Zuckerberg as needing to testify before a British quorum, investigating how the Brexit vote may have been influenced.","Summary","Article Name","500 Million Facebook Users’ Data Manipulated","Description","This week, the Guardian reported that Facebook has allowed more the 50 million users’ data to be used by Cambridge Analytica.

And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.","Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.","Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\"","Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.","In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted all of it.","Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act \"and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.","Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.","The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","And yet as the firm sought to build \"psychographic profiles\" to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Facebook's entire business model is surveilling your digital life for the most personal information possible and then selling it to whoever wants to pay for it.","So what should you do about it? There's the obvious answer of following the lead of Elon Musk and others and deleting your account. But if you organize events on the platform, share pictures with distant friends and relatives, or otherwise enjoy some specific benefits of connecting online, swearing off entirely might not be an appealing option.","If that's your conundrum, a chorus of experts might have a solution. Their idea sounds a little labor intensive at first, but hear them out. They swear that the best way to get the benefits of socializing online without the drawbacks is to have your own personal blog or website, and they claim it's way easier than you think.","Break out of the walled garden","Social media makes connecting online super easy, but there's a price to be paid for that convenience. First, you produce a lot of data that makes these sites a boatload of profit -- profit which isn't shared with you. Tech critic Nicholas Carr has called this \"digital sharecropping.\" You work. They get all the money.","Second, and probably more annoyingly for those of us who aren't too bothered by the work of posting pictures of our kids or travel adventures, that data is then used to shape what you see. Or, in the words of computer science professor and author Cal Newport , social media sites use your data to \"control your behavior -- nudging you toward certain ways of describing yourself and encountering the world that make you more profitable to the social media barons, but might alienate you from your humanity.\"","The solution, according to Newport and a host of other experts, is simple -- break out of the \"walled garden\" of social media by starting your own little kingdom in the form of your own blog or website.","\"If you want to connect and express yourself online, the best way to do so is to own your own website,\" insists Newport. \"Buy a domain. Setup a web hosting account (my host, A2, has introductory packages that cost less than $4 a month). Install WordPress or hand code a web site for this account. Let people follow you directly by checking your site, or subscribing to an RSS feed or email newsletter.\"","\"In other words, acquire your own damn digital land on which you can do whatever you want without anyone else trying to exploit you or influence your behavior,\" he advises.","Yes, that does sound like a bit more work than simply hitting 'post' on the Facebook app, but these days technology makes building a site relatively easy. And the benefits are immense. Setting up your own site will keep your data safe, but you'll also be nudging the internet towards a healthier and more broadly beneficial future, argued top VC Fred Wilson back January even before the latest revelations about Facebook:","\"We are in the 'Internet Two' phase as Steven Johnson called in it his piece that I blogged about yesterday. Internet One was an open network, open protocols, open systems. Internet Two is closed platforms that increasingly dominate the market and own and control our content and us. We need to get to Internet Three where we take back control of ourselves. It is high time for that to happen,\" he wrote.","What good is a blog if I'm the only one looking at it?","Good question. But as 20-year blogging veteran Jason Kottke notes, if you jump (back on) the blogging bandwagon, you might not be alone for long. He reports \"friends and writers, not thousands or probably even hundreds, but solid dozens, returning to old-fashioned weblogging as a way to get their thoughts in order, take ownership of their intellectual property, get away from the Twitter hubbub, stick it to Facebook, or any one of a dozen other reasons to write a blog.\"","That might not generate enough \"ambient humanity\" to satisfy our craving for social connection right now, but if enough people are bold enough to make the switch, blogs might be buzzing again soon enough, and without the drawbacks of having your phone mined or your data sold to hostile parties trying to swing elections."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The latest event highlights the growing footprint of the controversial firm in South Asia.","This comes amid a furious back-and-forth between the ruling BJP and the Congress accusing one another of availing the services of CA during their electoral campaigns. Cambridge Analytica, a political data-mining firm, has been accused of stealing data from 50 million Facebook users and used it to manipulate elections. Founded in 2013, the firm’s parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories tied up with Ovleno, an Indian firm, to provide services like “political campaign management”.","Before it was taken down, Ovleno’s site had a page listing the BJP, the Congress and the JD(U) among its clients. These claims by the company have not been verified, but both the BJP and Congress have strongly denied having any dealings with it.","The EIC also grew to prominence by using the policy of divide and rule to play off local rulers against each other. This weakened the local power structure allowing the EIC to capture the whole subcontinent in the name of the British Empire.","Congress claimed that CA’s local partner OBI talked of having helped the BJP achieve ‘Mission 272’ (in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014), and also providing constituency-wise database to BJP candidates in national elections and state polls in Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi.","Cambridge Analytica (CA) is in the eye of a storm after an undercover investigation caught some of its senior executives boasting about psychological manipulation, entrapment techniques and fake news campaigns in order to manipulate voters.","Not only that, a Britain-based news agency, Channel 4, has filmed senior executives at CA, including its Chief Executive Officer Alexander Nix, suggesting the firm could use sex workers, bribes and misinformation in order to try and help political candidates win votes around the world.","Data collected by an app created by Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher at the centre of Facebook’s data breach allegations, was used to target voters in the 2016 US presidential election. The firm mined the information of about 50 million Facebook users, according to whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Now, questions are being raised whether CA has worked or was in talks with Indian political parties and whether or not it used the same techniques that it had used in other parts of the globe to help Indian parties win elections.","Ovleno’s site had a page listing the BJP, the Congress and the JD(U) among its clients. These claims by the company have not been verified, but both the BJP and Congress have strongly denied having any dealings with it.","The influence of CA in the subcontinent is feared by many to be the return of the East India Company. The East India Company (EIC), also known as the Honorable East India Company (HEIC) or the British East India Company and informally as John Company, was an English and later British joint-stock company, that was formed to pursue trade with the “East Indies” (in present-day terms, Maritime Southeast Asia), but ended up trading mainly with Qing China and seizing control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent.","Data collected by an app created by Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher at the centre of Facebook’s data breach allegations, was used to target voters in the 2016 US presidential election.","CA seems to be a similar menace which has come to the subcontinent under the guise of “commerce”. But its foothold in the corridor of power in the form of a consultancy also parallels the rise of the EIC. The EIC also grew to prominence by using the policy of divide and rule to play off local rulers against each other. This weakened the local power structure allowing the EIC to capture the whole subcontinent in the name of the British Empire.","It seems to many that history is repeating itself, the CA is backing all the winning horses in the Indian political system while in Pakistan it is part of an unholy crusade against institutional supremacy.

The company just announced that it will end a feature called Partner Categories, launched back in 2013 out of a partnership between Facebook and major data brokers.","Third party data helps Facebook further atomize its user base into meaningful segments for advertisers. As TechCrunch explained when the data partnership first launched:","“Through new partnerships with top online and offline purchase data providers Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai, Facebook is now allowing advertisers to target hashed lists of existing and potential customers, and categories like role-playing gamers or soda drinkers.”","Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that the change is permanent, not a temporary precaution. In order to leverage the deep pool of data Facebook collects on users, the company mixes information that it obtains from users themselves (Pages a user liked, for instance) with information from advertisers (membership status in a loyalty program, for example) and with data obtained from third party providers.","While Facebook feels comfortable with the integrity of its data sourcing within the first two categories, it feels less settled about dipping into these aggregate pools of third party data. The decision was issued in light of the company’s recent privacy concerns over third-party data mishandling.","Facebook Product Marketing Director Graham Mudd elaborated on the decision in a statement:","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Facebook clarified that it will still work with companies like Experian and Acxiom in order to measure ad performance and provide metrics, although it will also be conducting a review of those ongoing relationships. Facebook may also move toward sharing data in a shared server environment in order to offer further assurances of user privacy. As Mudd noted, the program will be discontinued in the coming months."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

According to recent reports, another repository of Facebook data is Cambridge Analytica, a firm that worked for the Trump campaign and managed to buy personal data on 50 million Facebook users.Rainier Ehrhardt / Getty Images","If you missed it over the weekend, The New York Times and The Guardian have published long, must-read stories about how Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign's data firm, was involved in a sneaky and perhaps illegal data collection scheme that allowed Cambridge Analytica access to the private information of 50 million Facebook users. According to the New York Times:","The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","Facebook leaders don't want you to call it a breach, but whatever you call it, it's another opportunity for Facebook's billions of users to be reminded: you are the product. Facebook, like other social media platforms, is a machine for collecting personal data on individuals—which, true, is willingly given away by to Facebook by its users. The company then sells that data to advertisers and political campaigns by giving them the ability to precisely target Facebook users whose \"likes,\" interests, and associations make them appear susceptible to certain messages.","In the case of this breach, Cambridge Analytica got its hands on Facebook user data through sketchy means that have caused a 28-year-old former Cambridge Analytica employee to come forward as a whistle blower. \"I made Steve Bannon's psychological warfare tool,\" this data guru told The Guardian.","That tool, by the way, seems to have been effectively bought for Bannon (and Trump) by Robert Mercer, the conservative hedge fund billionaire whose massive yacht was docked in Lake Union last summer.","The data itself came into Cambridge Analytica's hands via a popular Facebook personality quiz, called myPersonality, that was essentially a Trojan horse for harvesting information that could be used to build psychological profiles of the people who took the quiz (and, alarmingly, all of their Facebook \"friends,\" too).","Facebook, which has known about this issue for years, suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and (controversially) the whistleblower just before the news broke.

Then they used this data to help the Trump and Brexit campaigns psychologically manipulate voters through targeted ads. The result was Vote Leave ‘won’ the UK’s Brexit referendum and Trump was elected president in the US.","Unfortunately, almost everything in the above summary is false or misleading.","First, There was no hack.","The data collected was scraped from Facebook user profiles, after users granted permission for a third party app to access their data. You know those little confirmation windows that pop up when someone wants to play Candy Crush or use Facebook to log in, rather than make a new password, for a random site? Yeah those.","A Cambridge academic called Aleksandr Kogan — NOT Cambridge Analytica and NOT the whistleblower Christopher Wylie — made a ‘Test Your Personality’ app, helped to promote it by paying people $1 to install it on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site, and used the permissions granted to harvest profile data. 270,000 users installed the app, so you might expect that 270,000 profiles were collected but the app actually collected data from 50 million profiles.","50 million?!?","Yes. You see back in the heady days of 2014, Facebook had a feature called ‘friends permission’ that allowed developers to access the profiles of not only the person who installed their app but all their friends too. The only way to prevent this from happening was to have toggled a privacy setting, which few Facebook users even knew existed (here is a blog from 2012 explaining how to do so). The friends permission feature is how Kogan multiplied 270,000 permissions into 50 million profiles worth of data.","That Facebook users were having their data shared by their friends without their knowledge or permission was a serious concern that many privacy advocates noted at the time. So in 2015, facing growing criticism and pressure, Facebook removed the feature citing a desire to give their users “more control”. This decision caused consternation amongst developers as the ability to access friends profiles was extremely popular (see the comments under this 2014 post from Facebook announcing the changes). Sandy Parakilas, an ex-Facebook manager, reported to Bloomberg that “tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers” were making use of the feature before it was discontinued.","To review, there are two key points to remember at this point:","None of what I just described involves ‘hacking’ Facebook or exploiting a bug. Instead, it all revolves around the use of a feature that Facebook provided to all developers and (at least) tens of thousands took advantage off.","The data collected was not internal Facebook data. It was data that developers scraped from the profiles of people who downloaded their apps (and their friends). Facebook has a lot more data on users than is publically available and it has it for everyone who uses their platform. No-one but Facebook has access to that data. This is a point that almost all the journalists involved seem unable to grasp, instead they repeatedly equate ‘Facebook’s internal data’ to ‘data scraped from Facebook profiles using a third party app’. But these are VERY different things.","The importance of this second point becomes apparent when you read exchanges like this one:","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.","This exchange is being reported as evidence that Facebook lied to politicians about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. But when you understand the difference between Facebook’s internal data and data collected on Facebook by outside developers it is clear that what Facebook’s policy director is saying is very likely true.","So where does Cambridge Analytica come in to the story?","Well, they paid Kogan to collect those 50 million profiles. Whose idea that was originally is currently a matter of ‘he said, she said’. Kogan says Cambridge Analytica approached him and Cambridge Analytica says Kogan came to them. Whatever the case may be, this is the part of the story where there was an actual breach; not of Facebook’s internal data but of Facebook’s data sharing policies. Developers were permitted to collect all the user data they wanted from their apps, but what they were not allowed to do — even back in 2014 — was take that data and sell it to a third party.","The fact that there were (at minimum) tens of thousands of developers with access to such information meant that it was inevitable that data harvested on Facebook was being sold, or otherwise provided, to a wide array of third parties. Again, the disgruntled ex Facebook manager confirmed as much:","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on. Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers.","So given how prevalent Facebook data harvesting was and that there are many developers with more than 270,000 users to harvest from, why is Cambridge Analytica receiving so much media attention?","The answer to this seems to primarily how journalists, particularly Carole Cadwalladr at the Observer, have framed the story. The majority of coverage has pushed two angles. First, that a whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica revealed ‘a major breach’ of Facebook’s data, an issue covered above, and second, that this ‘breach’ was linked to the success of Trump’s presidential campaign.","Chris Wylie the mastermind who ‘hacked’ Facebook…","This second angle is as dubious as the first and relies heavily on bombastic claims made by Chris Wylie—the pink haired ex-Cambridge Analytica employee pictured above. Carole Cadwalladr, who spent years on the story, has explained in various interviews that she approached the story not as an investigative journalist but as a features writer. This meant that she focused on delving into ‘the human side of the story’, or put another way- Chris Wylie. There are pros and cons to such an approach but the biggest drawback is how invested and reliant it made her and subsequent coverage in accepting Wylie’s narrative, which just so happens to paint him as a young mastermind at the center of global political conspiracies.","Cadwalladr fully endorses Wylie’s presentation and fawningly describes him as: “clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling” … “impossibly young” … “His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible” … “Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time” … “when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something — his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead — it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold” … “his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off.”","Wow… what a guy.","Cadwalladr’s person-focused approach might make for more accessible articles but it also helps to obscure the relevant technical details in favour of providing sensationalist quotes and personal anecdotes from Wylie and his friends and coworkers. Presenting these kinds of details could be insightful, if they were subjected to sufficient critical examination but this rarely occurs. Cadwalladr, instead, seems to have entirely bought into Wylie’s narrative: “by the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time.”","So let’s address the oversight and take a bit more of a critical look at what Wylie’s narrative claims:","That Cambridge Analytica claims to be able to provide effective tools for psychological targeting and manipulation… Certainly true.","That Chris Wylie, himself, was involved with some shady business and views himself as partly responsible… Sure.","That the self-promotional claims of Cambridge Analytica actually equate to how effective the services they provide are… Hmmmm.","This last point is the most important and yet it is also the one lacking almost any supporting evidence.","The temptation might be to point to Trump’s surprising victory but there are a lot of confounding factors there. Trump won, yes. But he won against the most unpopular Democratic candidate in modern history, who was vying for a third Democratic term (something which had not been achieved since the 1940s). Furthermore, he won by a very slim margin and actually lost the popular vote.","Could all that just be evidence of how precise Cambridge Analytica’s psychological targeting was? Maybe, but we start to run into the perils of dealing with an unfalsifiable hypothesis. A better approach would be to look at Cambridge Analytica’s relative record of success and failure. Unfortunately, we do not have access to their full client list but we do know that when they first rose to prominence they were working for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. That’s right, Ted Cruz — the Republican senator who was crushed by Trump in the Republican primaries, despite having the power of Cambridge Analytica at his command. I am not the first to notice this apparent contradiction, Martin Robbins made the same point on Little Atoms last year:","So the story of the Republican primaries is actually that Cambridge Analytica’s flashy data science team got beaten by a dude with a thousand-dollar website. To turn that into this breathtaking story of an unbeatable voodoo-science outfit, powering Trump inexorably to victory, is quite a stretch. Who else have they even worked for? Without a list of clients it’s very easy to cherry-pick the winners.","The techniques that Cambridge Analytica purport to use involve using social network data to build algorithms that can accurately predict what kind of messages will be effective given an individual’s personality and psychology. This is what the stories mean when they talk about using psychographics to micro-target voters. But a lot of the claims being made about the effectiveness of such techniques is widely exaggerated. Kogan — the Cambridge academic at the heart of the controversy — has made similar arguments. He claims that he is being scapegoated and argues that the personality profiles he gathered turned out to not be particularly useful for making the predictions needed for micro-targeting:","In fact, from our subsequent research on the topic,” he wrote, “we found out that the predictions we gave SCL were 6 times more likely to get all 5 of a person’s personality traits wrong as it was to get them all correct. In short, even if the data was used by a campaign for micro-targeting, it could realistically only hurt their efforts.","Kogan is hardly an impartial source but his claim accords with various studies that have shown less than stellar results for nefarious social media manipulation. Take, for instance, the controversial Facebook ‘mind control’ study, which I’ve heard several journalists reference in recent days. What always seems to be missing from reporting on this study is just how underwhelming it was.","Facebook ran an experiment on almost 689,000 users in which it tweaked the algorithm running their news feed to display slightly more or slightly less status updates from friends that contained positive or negative words. As any researcher knows, with such a large sample you are guaranteed to find statistically significant differences between groups. A more important criteria with such massive groups is how large the effect observed was. In the Facebook study this equated to a truly terrifying difference: those who saw less negative updates used around 0.05 more positive words out of every 100 words in their status updates, whereas those who saw less positive updates used around 1 less positive word per 100 in their status updates. That’s right Facebook might have been able to manipulate people to use around 1 less positive word for every 100 words in their updates. It would be wrong to paint this as Facebook being powerless, bigger interventions would have bigger effects, but it is important to keep things in perspective.","Note the starting point of the y-axis. There is a reason it isn’t 0.","The real story then is not that Kogan, Wylie, and Cambridge Analytica developed some incredibly high tech ‘hack’ of Facebook. It is that, aside from Kogan’s data selling, they used methods that were common place and permitted by Facebook prior to 2015. Cambridge Analytica has since the story broke been outed as a rather obnoxious, unethical company- at least in how it promotes itself to potential clients. But the majority of what is being reported in the media about its manipulative power is just an uncritical regurgitation of Cambridge Analytica (and Chris Wylie’s) self-promotional claims. The problem is that there is little evidence that the company can do what it claims and plenty of evidence that it is not as effective as it likes to pretend; see the fact that Ted Cruz is not currently president.","No one is totally immune to marketing or political messaging but there is little evidence that Cambridge Analytica is better than other similar PR or political canvassing companies at targeting voters. Political targeting and disinformation campaigns, including those promoted by Russia, certainly had an impact on recent elections but were they the critical factor? Did they have a bigger impact than Comey announcing he was ‘reopening’ the Hillary email investigation the week before the US election? Or Brexiteers claiming that £250 million was being stolen from the NHS by the EU every week? Colour me skeptical.","To be crystal clear, I’m not arguing that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan were innocent. At the very least, it is clear they were doing things that were contrary to Facebook’s data sharing policies. And similarly Facebook seems to have been altogether too cavalier with permitting developers to access its users’ private data.","What I am arguing is that Cambridge Analytica are not the puppet masters they are being widely portrayed as. If anything they are much more akin to Donald Trump; making widely exaggerated claims about their abilities and getting lots of attention as a result."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

While it will be weeks or even months before the many investigations into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica conclude, it's more clear than ever the company doesn't deserve our trust.","For years, Facebook encouraged a platform that allowed third parties to freely scrape as much personal data as they could get their hands on. Worse still, it turned a blind eye to those who abused the few rules they did have.","But while it may make you feel better (and make you a better IRL friend), deleting Facebook won't fix the data privacy nightmare we're only just waking up to.","For years, developers routinely gathered incredible amounts of personal information just by getting us to log into a quiz app or farm game.","Cambridge Analytica is getting the bulk of our attention for the moment, but it's far from the only company to profit from our information (even if it is the sleaziest).

Or, to use Silicon Valley parlance, it was a feature, not a bug.","We're now getting a sense of just how much we pay for all those times we eagerly smashed that \"login with Facebook\" button.","Mark Zuckerberg has promised the company will investigate every app that misused its platform and that Facebook will let people know if their personal data was impacted.

Throughout the last year, every time bad news has broken, executives have downplayed its significance. Look at its public statements last year about how many people had seen Russian-bought election ads — first it was 10 million, then it was 126 million.","Top execs dodged Congress when it was asking questions about Russian interference. They are selling their shares at a record clip.","The actions of Facebook execs now recall how execs at Nokia and Blackberry reacted after the iPhone emerged. Their revenues kept growing for a couple years -- and they dismissed the threats. By the time users started leaving in droves, it was too late.","There's no outside attacker bringing Facebook down. It's a circular firing squad that stems from the company's fundamental business model of collecting data from users, and using that data to sell targeted ads. For years, users went along with the bargain. But after almost a year of constant negative publicity, their patience may be waning.","Facebook did not initially respond to questions or a request for comment from CNBC.","The drumbeat","For more than a year now, Facebook has been deflecting stories about how its platform was used during the 2016 presidential election.","Some of this activity — like Facebook embedding workers with the Trump campaign to tell them how to advertise more effectively — was perfectly legal, and in line with normal business practices. A lot of these tactics would probably have drawn no scrutiny if Donald Trump hadn't surprised everybody by winning an election that all the polls showed him losing.","Other activity was against Facebook's policies, or outright illegal. Most notably, a U.S. grand jury recently indicted 13 Russian nationals for conducting a disinformation campaign on American soil intended to further political divisions in the country and sway the election toward Trump. Their tactics included using Facebook groups to organize divisive political protests and buying targeted ads.","CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has remained aloof throughout the whole sequence of events.","He addresses some of these issues on personal Facebook posts, but seldom talks to the press about them. Last year, he spent most of the year doing photo ops with people around America, but did not show up when Congress asked questions about how the Russians used Facebook to influence the 2016 election.","This year, he announced his annual personal challenge would be fixing Facebook — in other words, doing his job as the CEO of a publicly traded company worth more than $500 billion. In past years, he's taught himself Mandarin and hunted his own food.","The spin","Over the weekend, Facebook gave a case study in how the company reacts inappropriately to negative news.","On Friday night, Facebook made a surprise announcement that the company had suspended a political analytics research firm, Cambridge Analytica. The firm was funded by large Republican donor Robert Mercer, and Trump's campaign used it to target ads on Facebook.","In its Friday post, Facebook claimed it had discovered new evidence that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted data about Facebook users passed to it by a Russian-American researcher, who had collected it through a personality quiz that 270,000 Facebook users took. The data included information like the cities where users lived and what they had \"liked\" on Facebook.","It was against Facebook's terms of use for the researcher to pass the data along. Cambridge Analytica had told Facebook it had deleted the data back in 2015, but Facebook said it had received recent reports to the contrary, according to the blog post.","(Cambridge Analytica has countered the allegations, saying it was in compliance with Facebook's guidelines, and that no data collected through the app was used in the Trump campaign.)","But as is often the case in political scandal, the problem isn't so much the original action, but the cover-up. Or in this case, the spin.","It turns out that Facebook didn't just spontaneously decide to ban the political research firm. It was actually trying to get ahead of two bombshell reports, in the New York Times and The Observer (the Sunday edition of U.K. paper The Guardian). The publications detailed exactly how Cambridge Analytica had collected information about Facebook users in a bid to target them with political messages.","Facebook knew about these news stories for some time. It also appears that the company was trying to squelch the reports.","The Times report claimed that, in private conversations with the newspaper, Facebook \"downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control.\" The Guardian wrote that \"Facebook's external lawyers warned the Observer it was making 'false and defamatory' allegations, and reserved Facebook's legal position.\"","The stories went ahead anyway. Once they were published, Facebook executives immediately took to Twitter to defend the company, insisting that this was not a \"breach.\"","In tweets that were later deleted, Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos called the stories \"important and powerful,\" while insisting that it was \"incorrect to call it a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\" The deleted tweets are preserved below:","Another senior Facebook exec, Andrew Bosworth, echoed that claim, saying it was \"unequivocally not a data breach.\"","So far, more than 24 hours after the stories, Zuckerberg and his number-two, COO Sheryl Sandberg, have not responded.","Missing the point","The Facebook executives who responded are correct — there was no security breach. Users gave their information willingly. Moreover, Facebook has since put better security controls for apps in place, so users can more easily control what information apps are gathering and how they're using it.","But they're missing the point.","Facebook users are slowly learning that almost anybody can use Facebook to collect detailed information about them, and that — at least some of the time — Facebook cannot control where this information flows, or how it is used. Using Facebook is like writing your life story down on a piece of paper, then taping it to a lamppost.","Journalists and privacy advocates may roll their eyes at this \"revelation\" — they've been warning people about Facebook and privacy since its inception.","Users mostly ignored these warnings. They wanted to share photos, connect with old friends, play games, take quizzes and watch videos, and Facebook gave them a simple way to do it. More than 2 billion people around the world now use the 14-year-old service, and Facebook sold nearly $40 billion worth of ads last year.","But things are beginning to change. There's a growing sense that Facebook has become creepy instead of fun.","A lot of people are noticing that the ads on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram are so precisely targeted, they're sure the company is eavesdropping on their conversations through their phone microphones. (Facebook swears it is not — CNBC's Michelle Castillo has a great explanation of what is probably going on.)","More to the point, people are starting to curb their Facebook usage. In the fourth quarter, for the first time ever, the number of people in North America who used Facebook every day dropped from the previous year.","Also, Zuckerberg told investors on the company's earnings call that the company saw a 5 percent drop in time spent on Facebook during the quarter. The company claimed that this reduced engagement was because of some technical changes that Facebook made to crack down on low-quality content and give users a more positive experience.","These are just two small metrics. Facebook is still growing in many regions and by many other measurements.","But still: Fewer people using Facebook every day in one region, and spending less time on it. That's never happened before.","For the time being, advertisers are grumbling about Facebook and warning their clients to stay away from certain ad products, but they're still putting their money there — with an audience over 2 billion and some of the most accurate ad targeting available, Facebook is still impossible to ignore.","But if usage continues to decline, advertisers will start eventually follow. And there are plenty of hungry smaller competitors — Twitter and Snap, particularly — who would be happy to take some of that money.","Executive stock sales not reassuring","Meanwhile, Facebook executives are not exactly sending a reassuring message to investors by unloading their shares at a rapid clip.","Last summer, after Zuckerberg's plan to create another class of stock to solidify his control of the company foundered, he announced he'd begin selling off up to 75 million shares (about 18 percent of his stake), worth nearly $13 billion, by mid-2019. The money will support the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), his other company devoted to good works.","Why now? Zuckerberg is 33 years old -- far from retirement. What exactly is CZI doing that requires such a massive investment? Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is building rocket ships to explore space with his other company Blue Origin, and he only needs to spend $1 billion a year.","Other top executives are also selling in massive amounts. Jan Koum, who founded the messaging app WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014 for $19 billion, sold $2.8 billion worth of shares last year — more than any exec at any major tech company. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sold $2 billion of stock last year, in part to fund Blue Origin. Nobody else is close.)","Sandberg sold over $300 million, which pales in comparison to her colleagues but is still unusually large among officers of top tech companies.","Facebook stock is up over 80 percent in the last 12 months. Perhaps these execs are just taking gains, as any normal employee with stock compensation would be advised to do.","But these are not normal employees. They're the leaders of the company.","Other leaders keep skin in the game during difficult times -- think of how Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer held on to most of his stock throughout his tenure, even as Microsoft faced expensive antitrust lawsuits and growing competitive threats, or how Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey bought shares in 2017 when many investors had written the company off.","Facebook is facing real problems. Instead of giving answers to those problems, top execs are selling, spinning and staying silent."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Your likes, your follows, and even everything you search for or just browse through on Instagram and Facebook can help advertisers target you.","What the fuck?!","So do brands know if I like a Kim Kardashian selfie?","Not exactly; they don’t know that you liked it, but all of your Instagram activity is rolled into a whole set of data that advertisers can use to target people like you.","How does a brand use my Instagram activity to target me?","Let’s say an online shoe store wants to target new potential customers. One way it can do this is to upload a list of their customer emails into the Facebook ad manager. Facebook can identify those people from their emails, and then it analyzes those people based on everything it knows about them. Then, it comes up with a new, similar group of potential customers — and that’s who the shoe store should target with its ads. So while your Instagram likes might just be a small detail about you, they help advertisers target you.","What if my Instagram is private?","Sorry, they’re still using your data to target you with ads. Going private on Instagram only affects how other users can see you, and has nothing to do with your data or ad targeting.","What if I use a “finsta” that’s separate from my regular Instagram?","If you’re switching between accounts in the app, it knows they’re connected to the same Facebook account. You might see different ads on the two accounts based on your activity, but they both use your Facebook profile to target you.","Is Facebook or Instagram listening to what I say? The other day I was talking about something out loud and then saw an Instagram ad for it.","No, although lots of people certainly have noticed the same thing. The trick is, Facebook is so good at targeting you that it can tailor Instagram ads scarily well.","I noticed an Instagram ad for something I looked at online recently — what’s up with that?","Should I delete my Instagram??!!","Your call. If all of this freaks you out so much you’re willing to give up the fun and joy of Instagram, then delete. But if Instagram and Facebook bring you joy, then… Here are some tips on how to limit the data you give Facebook.","BuzzFeed’s own Nick Greene, one of our in-house advertising experts (yes, we target people on Facebook to advertise to them too), helped explain some of the details in this post about how Facebook and Instagram ad targeting works.","Katie Notopoulos is a senior editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

The Special Briefing tells you what you need to know about an important issue, individual or story that is making news. Each one serves up an interesting selection of facts, opinions, images and videos in order to catch you up and vault you ahead.","WHAT TO KNOW","What happened. Cambridge Analytica, the election consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, the Brexit campaign and dozens of other political clients, is accused of harvesting private information from more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission. In secret recordings, broadcast by Britain’s Channel 4 News on Monday, the firm’s CEO, Alexander Nix, bragged about swaying the 2016 election for President Donald Trump and explained how the firm uses sex workers, bribes and misinformation to help its political clients. Nix was suspended after the news broke.","Why it matters. Cambridge’s improper collection of Facebook data, reportedly overseen by ex–White House adviser Steve Bannon and funded by billionaire Trump backer Robert Mercer, helped the firm exploit the private social media activity of millions of American users in an attempt to influence their behavior during the 2016 election. Facebook reportedly learned about the data leak back in 2015 but did not suspend the firm from its network or inform users that their data had been harvested until the story was exposed.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO Alexander Nix at the company’s office on Fifth Avenue in New York City, 10 blocks south of Trump Tower.","HOW TO THINK ABOUT IT","Look behind the veil. On paper, Cambridge Analytica is a strategic communications firm offering clients behavioral research to optimize their marketing methods. In reality, critics say, the firm exploited both Facebook and the name of a world-class institution to surreptitiously tip the scales for its high-profile clients, including the Trump campaign. The firm paid to acquire the private Facebook data through a Russian-American professor named Aleksandr Kogan at the University of Cambridge, who claimed to be using it for academic purposes. Kogan has received Russian government research grants in the past, but claims he had no idea what Cambridge Analytica was really doing with the data.","Click here to see your perfect president. The data was originally mined from Facebook users under the guise of a personality testing app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” That data included information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles because of Cambridge’s ability to gather information from friends of the personality test users. The data was then used for crafting personalized political ads as well as Trump campaign strategy.","The trail of your ‘digital breadcrumbs.’ Often described as the world’s largest and most lucrative advertising platform, Facebook plays a central role in making your personal data available to thousands of apps, whose aim is to collect user information. It’s often sold to data brokers like Acxiom, which effectively own your “digital breadcrumbs.” Companies like Farmville and Tinder, as well as Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, use Facebook data. All such activity has been loosely regulated thus far — but that could change after the Cambridge Analytica revelations.","Then-candidate Donald Trump talks to reporters after the first prime-time presidential debate on August 6, 2015, in Cleveland, Ohio.","What’s on your mind, Facebook?USA Today calls the data-harvesting crisis a “catastrophic moment” for Facebook. Yet the company’s response has been uncharacteristically slow, aside from its initial threats to sue The Observer, the British newspaper that broke the story. “The entire company is outraged we were deceived,” a Facebook statement noted days after the reports. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg went further: “This was a major breach of trust, and I’m really sorry that this happened.” Meanwhile, the story has hammered the company’s stock price, left employees demoralized and prompted the hashtag #deletefacebook.","Let the investigations begin. Cambridge Analytica is facing investigations by Parliament and government regulators in Britain while Facebook confronts federal and state investigations into its mishandling of user data. Federal Trade Commission fines for the violations could potentially reach $2 trillion.","WHAT TO WATCH","“You are playing with the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness … [and] in the context of the democratic process.”","Watch on The Guardian on YouTube:","Cambridge Analytica: Undercover Secrets of Trump’s Data Firm","“We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.” — Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix to an undercover reporter","Watch on Channel 4 News on YouTube:","WHAT TO SAY AT THE WATERCOOLER","According to a former employee at Cambridge Analytica, the firm was testing out slogans like “Drain the Swamp” and “Build the Wall” as early as 2014 — well before Donald Trump entered the 2016 campaign and made the slogans the staple of his political rallies."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

That’s not good enough.","text":["It insults those who don’t have the privilege of leaving. And it suggests Facebook has failed consumers—when the company has really failed society.","People are mad at Facebook, and they should be. The company allowed thousands of app developers to extract their data through time-sucking games and pointless online quizzes. And now, thanks to a whistleblower and two stunning reports in the Observer and the New York Times, we know that one of those developers siphoned data on more than 50 million Facebook users and shared them with the Trump campaign’s voter targeting firm, Cambridge Analytica—a company that has bragged it has psychological profiles on 230 million American voters, which it uses to target people online with emotionally precise digital messaging to influence elections. This was the trade-off for logging in to see baby photos?","Whether Cambridge Analytica’s claims are inflated (only about 139 million people voted in the 2016 election, after all) is fair to debate, but the heart of the controversy is harder to dismiss: It now feels time to reconsider Facebook’s bargain. We gave the company the trust it asked for, along with our photos and thoughts and likes and shares. We all knew of course, that this information helped Facebook sell us to advertisers; fewer were probably aware that until a few years ago, app developers also had access to our data, even if it was there in the terms of service. Many certainly didn’t think that those app developers could break those terms and sell that data to whomever they wanted, including political operatives. This may not technically be a “breach” of Facebook’s platform, as the company has stressed. But it is a breach of trust.","Hence: #DeleteFacebook. The Twitter hashtag emerged in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, and began to feel like a movement Tuesday night when WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton—a man whose company was sold to Facebook for $16 billion—tweeted that “It is time.”","The #DeleteFacebook instinct is understandable: Just be done with it. Put your phone to your ear and call people. Use Twitter or Instagram—the latter of which is owned by Facebook, but hey, at the least it’s mostly made up of sun-dappled vacation photos. Write a letter! Talk to neighbors! Whatever you do to fill that void of connection, just walk away from Facebook. If you’re angry about what Facebook is doing, the logic goes, you should take your business elsewhere.","I understand this reaction, but it’s also an unfair one: Deleting Facebook is a privilege. The company has become so good at the many things it does that for lots of people, leaving the service would be a self-harming act. And they deserve better from it, too. Which is why the initial answer to Facebook’s failings shouldn’t be to flee Facebook. We need to demand a better Facebook.","I say all this as someone who basically did walk away from Facebook a few years ago. I still have an account, but I tend to just log on out of curiosity, to report a story, or to write the occasional life update. I don’t have the app on my phone, and I probably log in once a week. But I could afford to leave Facebook—and I did pay a cost for it. I’ve lost touch with friends. I don’t go out much anymore and don’t know when cool things I might like to go to are happening. I’m pretty much not a part of any scene anymore. I don’t know when old friends are in town I’d love to see. Back when I promoted art openings and booked music shows, I always had to make a Facebook event; if I wanted to do so again, I’d still have to go through Facebook. Leaving Facebook was a retreat. But not everyone has the luxury of making one.","For lots of people, leaving Facebook would be a self-harming act. And they deserve better from it,too.","Unlike broadcast television and radio, which are also free for the price of having to endure ads, on Facebook you can’t change the channel. If you leave Facebook—which is where your friends, scene, and community already is—you’re alone, because for many people, Facebook is becoming the internet and the internet is becoming Facebook. Your business could have trouble reaching customers; your family might not gather on another social network; no one posts any events anywhere else. All of which means that leaving Facebook simply doesn’t make sense for many people. It’s a network effect, a kind of natural monopoly; migrating to another social network would only work if enough people migrate there, too. In other words, if you want to be a part of any social life or local political conversations or want to promote your work, that simply means being on Facebook.","Even when I left Facebook personally, I didn’t professionally. That’s because media outlets rely on Facebook, too. A huge chunk of the readers of my articles find them through Facebook—and if they like them, they share them on Facebook, so others can read them. But my work depended on Facebook before I was a journalist, too. When I was an activist working to defend online privacy and protect people from digital surveillance at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we would post our blog posts and events … yep, on Facebook. It’s one of the main ways we got the word out. The same was true at previous jobs. Every campaign or issue I was organizing around needed to have a presence on Facebook. Before Facebook, activists sent a lot of emails and made a lot of phone calls. It worked, but as soon as everyone started using Facebook, we had to be there too. Otherwise we risked invisibility.","Likewise, if you have a small business, sometimes a Facebook page is your online presence. If you’re not operating in the service industry or with a storefront, Yelp might not make sense. Facebook, for all its problems, has become a necessary part of life for people, one that they can’t afford to shed, personally or professionally.","And in countries with lower internet adoption, Facebook is often people’s foray onto the whole internet. Facebook’s Free Basics program is operating in 63 countries and municipalities across Africa, Asia, and Latin America—and with that, people get free access to Facebook and a small handful of websites that partner with Facebook, though they can’t access other sites or email. For those users, Facebook is, in a sense, the whole internet.","So sure, delete Facebook if you can. The company may not deserve your trust or your business, and you’ll have more free time to do other, better things. But if you can’t quit, that’s OK, too. That’s why #DeleteFacebook is the wrong message: It frames this as an issue of individual consumer choice. But it’s really a problem in search of a solution either from Facebook itself—changing its service so that its users really can feel safe—or from the government, which may need to step in and blow the whistle on Facebook’s entire business model.","If you think Facebook is worth deleting over its issues, then call your elected official to regulate the company, as well as other companies, like Google, that profit from harvesting our personal details to sell ads tailored to us across the internet. Because it’s becoming clearer that we can’t trust these companies to regulate themselves, and these conversations about user privacy, security, and well-being are incredibly important for those who can’t afford to not be on Facebook.","There’s no comprehensive federal online privacy law in the U.S. Meanwhile, these companies have become some of the most powerful and wealthy entities in the world in large part thanks to having few checks on their data collection. The more we learn about that corporate surveillance, the less simple it is to dismiss it. It was only a few months ago that journalists learned that Facebook let advertisers target people based on hateful keywords, like “Jew haters” and “How to burn Jews.” And Facebook knew that Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully obtained tens of millions of their users’ data without saying a word publicly—and even then, it took two years and teams of journalists to write major stories about how bad the whole situation was to get Facebook to fess up.","So I’m with you, Facebook deleters, but only to a point. Because as constituents of Facebook, we also need to advocate for a safer platform for anyone who’s unable to hop off."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

The letter also instructs Zuckerberg to \"direct your staff\" to brief the committee about the controversy.","The letter to Zuckerberg, sent by Thune and Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan., requests information relating to data reportedly obtained by Strategic Communications Laboratories Group and its affiliate, Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook on Friday confirmed that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica from operating on its platforms as it investigated whether the firm failed to delete information that Cambridge Analytica had received through an academic researcher.","\"Consumers rely on platforms like Facebook to be transparent and truthful in their terms of service so consumers can make informed decisions about whether to consent to the sharing and use of their data,” the senators wrote in their letter to Zuckerberg.","“We appreciate that Facebook has recently taken steps to address this situation. Nevertheless, the possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers, or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers, is troubling,\" the senators wrote.","The Commerce committee leaders sent a separate letter to Strategic Communications Laboratories Group CEO Nigel Oakes requesting information and a briefing related to the use and sharing of individual Facebook user data.","Earlier Monday, two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana, asked Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., to hold a hearing so senators can publicly grill Zuckerberg and other social media CEOs.","\"Facebook, Google, and Twitter have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data and use this data when selling advertising, including political advertisements,\" the senators wrote in a letter to Grassley. \"The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.\"","Cambridge Analytica says it relies on personality surveys and thousands of pieces of data on each American to create \"psychographic\" profiles to predict how people will vote. The firm worked on President Trump's 2016 campaign and has had financial backing from hedge-fund billionaire and Trump supporter Robert Mercer and his family.","On Monday afternoon, Grassley spokesman George Hartmann said the senator is taking the request from Klobuchar and Kennedy \"under advisement\" but has not decided whether to summon the tech CEOs to Washington for a hearing.","Even before news reports emerged in recent days about the potential misuse of Facebook data, federal regulators and Congress grappled with social media's growing influence on U.S. elections and the ways in which Russian operatives used the platforms to attempt to sow social unrest ahead of the 2016 presidential contest.","Digital ads are skyrocketing","During the last midterm election in 2014, digital advertising accounted for less than 1% of political spending in federal, states and local elections, according to advertising tracking firm Borrell Associates. In this election cycle, the firm predicts digital advertising will soar to about 22% — or $1.9 billion — of the more than $8 billion that it estimates will be spent on political ads.","Social media allows politicians and others trying to influence elections to target particular voters at a relatively low cost compared to television or radio ads that reach a broader audience, said Borrell executive Kip Cassino.","\"People are turning away from the idea of sending your messages out to a whole bunch of people and hoping that some of them will gravitate toward it,\" Cassino said. \"Instead, they are choosing to talk with people who already agree with their messages or are likely to agree.\"","The federal government, however, has struggled to catch up with the fast-changing media environment. Television broadcasters, for instance, are subject to Federal Communications Commission rules that require them to publicly detail who bought ads on their stations and how much they spent.","Facebook, Twitter and other social networks do not face similar requirements.","Just last week, the Federal Election Commission, which regulates political campaign activity, voted to begin writing rules that detail the kinds of disclaimers they will require on online and mobile political ads to identify sponsors.","The agency last wrote broad rules on Internet advertising in 2006.","Online political advertising was seen \"initially as a force for good,\" because it offered a lower cost way for candidates to advertise and could serve as a counterweight to the influence of big political donors, said Ellen Weintraub, a veteran Democratic commission member who now serves as its vice chairwoman","\"Now, we know it isn't universally good,\" she told USA TODAY in a Monday interview. \"There are risks here.\"","Last November, angry senators warned attorneys for Facebook, Twitter and Google that they must do more to prevent Russian manipulation of their social media platforms or Congress would be forced to impose new rules to help people identify malicious content. Attorneys for the three social media giants testified before the House and Senate intelligence committees last Nov. 1 about how Russia exploited their platforms to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. Lawmakers expressed disappointment back then that the companies had sent their attorneys rather than their CEOs.","\"This (the Cambridge Analytica news) is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, a former tech entrepreneur who serves as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","On Monday morning, Facebook officials said they were undertaking an audit into the allegations about Cambridge Analytica. An update on Facebook's blog said later that independent forensic auditors from Stroz Friedberg were on site at Cambridge Analytica’s London office on Monday evening. However, the Facebook blog reported: \"At the request of the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Stroz Friedberg auditors stood down.\"","\"We have a pretty good track record as a company of — once we set our mind to doing something — we eventually get it done,\" Zuckerberg told USA TODAY in a November interview. But, he conceded, \"I don't know how long it will take to address this.\"","Warner and Klobuchar said the latest revelations underscore the need for Congress to quickly pass the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill that they introduced with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to require Facebook, Twitter, Google and other social media companies to disclose who is paying for political ads that appear on their online platforms.","Facebook disclosed last September that it had identified more than $100,000 worth of political ads purchased by a Russian company linked to the Kremlin. Most of the 3,000 ads, which ran between June 2015 and May 2017, focused on divisive issues such as immigration, gun control, gay rights and race.","The Honest Ads Act would require social media companies to follow the same rules as radio, television and print media when it comes to public disclosure of who is sponsoring political ads.","An identical bill has been introduced in the House by Reps. Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., and Mike Coffman, R-Colo.","However, there have so far been no hearings or votes on the bill in either chamber. The Republican-led Congress has generally been reluctant to impose any new regulations on business.","Meredith McGehee, executive director of the Issue One watchdog group, helped draft the Honest Ads proposals. She also blamed the stalemate on partisanship, particularly as lawmakers prepare to face voters in November.","\"Right now, if you use the words 'social media' in the context of the election, it's assumed you are espousing an anti-Trump message,\" she said, \"so it scares away most Republicans.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

SCL had illegitimately obtained data about Facebook users, and had apparently not destroyed that data when Facebook ordered it to in 2015. Consequently, the company was no longer allowed access to Facebook’s platform. “We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook,” Grewal concluded.","The next morning, it became clear just why SCL and Cambridge Analytica had been suspended so abruptly, and at such an odd hour: because the New York Times and the Observer were prepping major investigative stories about the company’s use of Facebook data, based on documents and other information from a 26-year-old whistle-blower named Christopher Wylie.","Both stories are excellent, and help us better understand exactly what Cambridge Analytica did during the 2016 election (and the primaries before it). But there are a few points worth pulling out and emphasizing.","Facebook was being used as it’s designed, and that’s the problem.","In 2014, while working at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie hired a University of Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan to build a database of psychometric profiles. Cambridge Analytica — funded by the right-wing billionaire Mercer family and advised by then–Breitbart editor-in-chief Steve Bannon — hoped to use the data to target political advertising and influence voter behavior. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk freelance boards, Kogan hired around 270,000 people to fill out a survey in an app that they would install in their Facebook accounts.","Facebook apps, like FarmVille, extend the platform’s usability, but in installing them, users often give third-party developers like Kogan access to a significant amount of their own data. Worse, in 2014, when Kogan’s app was gathering data, Facebook’s terms of service allowed developers to request access to an app installer’s friends as well.","In other words, each of the 270,000 people who were paid to install the app also gave up a significant amount of data about their Facebook friends as well — meaning that from the original 270,000 subjects, Kogan managed to obtain as many as 50 million profiles, including information like locations, job and educational histories, and pages liked. Facebook has since changed privacy settings that mean you can’t be data-betrayed by your inconsiderate or careless friends. But at the time, there was nothing about what Kogan was doing with his app that broke any of Facebook’s rules. It wasn’t until he passed that data on to Cambridge Analytica that he put himself in violation of Facebook’s terms of use.","Facebook has therefore insisted that it was not party to a “breach” of user data. You could argue that this is a semantic argument, largely designed to protect the company from SEC regulations that would have required them to alert users that their data had been mishandled and distributed without explicit permission. Certainly, user trust has been breached, even if no particular server or database was illegally or maliciously accessed.","But I actually agree with Facebook on this point: It wasn’t breached; Kogan obtained profile data perfectly legitimately. I just don’t think that’s a good defense. As hardly needs stating at this point, Facebook’s business model is built on gathering data about its users. (“We … built models to exploit what we knew about [people] and target their inner demons,” Wylie tells the Observer. “That was the basis the entire company was built on.” He’s talking about Cambridge Analytica, but the statement is equally true of Facebook.) You can argue that it was a bad idea to allow a surveillance-advertising company to grow to the size and influence of Facebook. But everyone can agree that the data Facebook has gathered on its users should be better protected, and that users should have better knowledge of and control over that data. Kogan was able to access profiles of 50 million users by paying a mere 270,000 users to install an app — and able to pass that data on to a third party without Facebook’s knowledge — because Facebook made it remarkably easy to obtain information about its users, not because he did something particularly nefarious.","If this has happened once, it’s probably happened more than once.","Kogan ran afoul of the rules by passing the data he’d obtained to a third party — Cambridge Analytica. He’d presented the app to Facebook and to its users as a project gathering for academic research, but then had turned around and given it to a company that had not been named or identified, and which sought to use the data for political, not academic, purposes.","But it’s worth noting that the only reason any of us know that this happened is because of Cambridge Analytica’s prominence in the news. Facebook itself only seems to have become aware that Kogan’s data was being misused in late 2015, after a Guardian report outlined the company’s data-harvesting techniques. Having learned that millions of its users’ data was now in the hands of a company to whom no such permissions had been granted, Facebook demanded that Cambridge Analytica delete that data — and then never followed up.","The fact that all this data was obtained legitimately in the first place, and that the discovery that it had been mishandled was met with only token objection by Facebook, is not, to put it mildly, confidence-inspiring. If the Guardian had never reported on the Cruz campaign’s contract with Cambridge Analytica, would Facebook (or any of us) even know that profile data on so many users was out there? And given that, shouldn’t we be assuming that this same thing — shady mass data-harvesting of Facebook profiles, to be kept on third-party servers — has happened more than once?","Facebook has known about this for a long time, and has done nothing.","The Observer and Times stories are valuable for the level of detail they bring to Cambridge Analytica’s practices, and for the attention they draw to Facebook’s lax privacy protections. But much of the key information in both stories could also be found in an Intercept story from last year — and in the aforementioned Guardian story from December 2015.","It’s easy to be cynical about the sudden attention the story is now getting from the public, given that we’ve had two years to process Cambridge Analytica’s methods. And surely some of the attention is unwarranted — the result of sensationalized chatter about Cambridge Analytica’s overstated role in Trump’s victory. (More on that in a minute.) But Facebook has been silent over the course of those two years, too. To its credit, it’s changed app permissions so that developers can no longer access such a wide network of profiles. Yet even after it was aware that Cambridge Analytica was in possession of mishandled profile data, it did nothing beyond send a letter. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted,” Wylie told the Observer. It’s hard to square that with Facebook lawyer Grewal’s claim that “[p]rotecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do.”","The trouble is with Facebook, not (necessarily) Cambridge Analytica.","Trump’s victory in 2016 was so unexpected, and so close, that a whole cottage industry of explanations for his victory — from the prosaic to the conspiracy-driven — has emerged in its wake. Early coverage of Cambridge Analytica tended toward the sensational: Soon after the election, the Guardian called Cambridge Analytica’s influence “sinister,” and it was suggested in the woollier corners of Twitter that its “psychometric profiles” were not just a deciding factor in the election but a particularly dangerous one.","The truth is that there’s very little evidence that Cambridge Analytica’s particular methods have any different effect on voting behavior than any other digital political campaign efforts. Dave Karpf, a professor at Georgetown and expert in political advocacy on the internet, has called Cambridge Analytica the “Theranos of political data” — a company with “a tremendous marketing department, coupled with a team of research scientists who provide on virtually none of those marketing promises.”","Given the narrowness of Trump’s margins, could Cambridge Analytica have provided the extra nudge that pushed him across the finish line? Sure! And, yes, it’s awfully interesting that Cambridge Analytica employed a Russian-American professor who received funding from the Russian government. But until more reporting is done, that’s all it is — interesting. As Cambridge Analytica itself has resentfully pointed out, the Obama campaign was undertook similar Facebook data-gathering efforts. Those campaigns were aboveboard, and the uses of the data made clear to those who signed up — no small distinction — but they still used Facebook in much the same way. Focusing on Cambridge Analytica as a uniquely sinister actor in the election (or in the world of data acquisition or voter-targeting) ignores exactly how easy, and how mundane, their data-harvesting really was — and how vulnerable your Facebook data really is."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement.","In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.","Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections","illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

Over the past few years, we’ve become more aware of the way big businesses in the food industry can control our dietary choices for their own benefit and have had more conversations about empowering food consumers to make healthy choices and care for themselves — regardless of what food lobbyists and politicians end up deciding in Washington.

Some former Facebook employees allege that “the platform’s features were consciously engineered to induce a dopamine hit to keep people hooked.” Author and professor Adam Alter compares these new technologies and smart devices to slot machines and other addictive substances in terms of their impact on our minds and physical well-being — as well as on our inability to turn away.","It’s easy to think of Facebook as a tabula rasa on which the thoughts, pictures and videos of our friends and family appear. But a lot goes on beneath the network’s docile facade. When it comes to information consumption, the platform matters as much as the content. Facebook profits when we remain on its platform for hours at a time: watching ads and videos, playing games, liking pages and posts, messaging our friends. It is in Facebook’s interest to keep us hooked — even if studies show that inordinate amounts of time online are bad for our mental health and wholeness. “FOMO” (fear of missing out), cyberbullying and online peer pressure have deeply affected young people on Facebook and other social media platforms — but digitally influenced depression and anxiety are affecting older social media users as well. One can only imagine how that deleterious impact may grow and shift as Facebook embraces augmented and virtual reality.","Our lives are growing increasingly static and insulated as we turn to Netflix, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Hulu and the like for entertainment and community. We’re spending less time in constructive real-time activity and interaction — interacting with strangers and acquaintances — and more time online. The average teenager spends over 4.5 hours a day on his or her smartphone. In 2014, Austrian researchers found that study participants reported lower moods after spending just 20 minutes on Facebook. A 2016 study with 1,700 participants found that social media users have a threefold risk of depression and anxiety. In her recently released book “iGen,” psychologist Jean Twenge considers the impact social media and smart devices have had on young Americans: “The more time teens spend looking at screens, the more likely they are to report symptoms of depression,” Twenge wrote for the Atlantic last year. “Eighth-graders who are heavy users of social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent, while those who play sports, go to religious services, or even do homework more than the average teen cut their risk significantly.” Time online isn’t necessarily bad in moderation, but because it’s so addictive and hard to stop, it can prevent us from partaking in better, more wholesome activities.","MIT professor and author Sherry Turkle has long noted the impact social media has on real-time relationships and conversations. The mere presence of a smartphone — sitting on a table or in someone’s lap, for instance — can subconsciously impact our conversations. In her book “Reclaiming Conversation,” she talks to children and teens who feel ignored by their parents when they’re texting or on Facebook. Parents, meanwhile, struggle to connect with teenagers who have increasingly retreated into online social bubbles. We are “alone together,” Turkle says, and we’ve lost the “raw, human part” of social interactivity.","We may not be able to change Facebook’s News Feed algorithm or transparency policies. But we can control what we share on Facebook — as well as how often we share it. We can treat the platform more cautiously, as we might sugar or any other product with addictive capabilities. Perhaps our greatest problem is not that we use Facebook but that we trust it almost blindly, giving it an inordinate amount of our information, time and attention.","Back when I first started using Facebook, it was a small and unknown site. My friends and I never could have guessed how large, diverse and ubiquitous the site would become over the next decade. Perhaps Zuckerberg is as surprised as the rest of us. But one thing is clear: Facebook is no longer a tiny social media site. It’s a colossus that, like all business giants, values profit over the well-being of its users. And it’s about time we started treating it like one.","Gracy OlmsteadGracy Olmstead is a writer and journalist living outside Washington, D.C. Follow"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The following year, that company, Eunoia Technologies, subsequently pitched Republican political operative Corey Lewandowski on microtargeting tools that could be deployed on behalf of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Emails from 2014 provided to BuzzFeed News show that Eunoia possessed a database of more than 50 million Facebook profiles at the time. That same information — and Facebook’s wider data collection policies in general — are now being scrutinized following reports by the New York Times and the Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired it from a company called Global Science Research (GSR), which originally collected it for academic purposes.","GSR, Cambridge Analytica, and Wylie said they have since deleted the data. Cambridge Analytica, which Donald Trump’s presidential campaign employed throughout 2016 to build ad-targeting profiles on potential voters, claimed in a statement Friday that none of the Facebook information in question was used for the election. And while there is no current indication Eunoia used the database or pitched it to Lewandowski, the fact that Wylie's little-known startup — which was a wholly distinct entity from Cambridge Analytica — possessed it at all is the latest in a string of revelations in Facebook's data crisis and further evidence that the company is unable to track how the personal profile information it collects is employed and distributed by third parties.","Other documents from Eunoia, which marketed ad microtargeting services to corporate and political clients, reveal that in the spring of 2015 Wylie’s startup pitched elections-related work to Trump’s eventual campaign manager, Lewandowski. One source, who declined to be named for fear of endangering personal and business relationships confirmed the authenticity of these documents; another person, who had direct knowledge of Eunoia’s meeting with Lewandowski, confirmed the Wylie-led startup’s interest in working for the fledgling Trump campaign.","Since blowing the whistle on Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, Wylie has said very little about Eunoia and his aspirations for it. He also has not spoken at all about his startup’s meeting with Lewandowski, who would go on to lead the Trump campaign. In response to BuzzFeed News’ questions about Eunoia last week, Wylie’s lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that her client “has not worked for Republican clients since leaving [Cambridge Analytica]” and that his company had “no data or assets.”","“Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets.”","The documents obtained by BuzzFeed and subsequent interviews with sources do not always cast Wylie in a flattering light, but they also do not call into question his claims about the improper transfer of Facebook user data to political consulting entities. After responding to an initial request for comment, Wylie's attorney went dark and did not answer the questions BuzzFeed News put to her Tuesday.","In a four-hour hearing of the UK Commons select committee on digital culture, media, and sport on Tuesday, Wylie was asked by committee chair Damian Collins if he had benefited from the GSR data set on other projects that he’d worked on outside of Cambridge Analytica.","“I didn’t do any contracts or do any, you know, work with that data,” Wylie replied. “I haven’t worked with any clients … That data got deleted, I believe, in 2015 on my end.”","“SCL Without Alexander Nix”","Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Wylie discussed plans to “build the NSA’s wet dream” in late 2013 while still working at Cambridge Analytica. “Our goal is first to make it an extremely profitable company,” he wrote in late 2013. “Then we will cleanse our souls with other projects, like using the data for good rather than evil. But evil pays more.\"","According to two people who knew Wylie at this time, the SCL microtargeting specialist had approached a number of colleagues about leaving their jobs to join him in a new company. According to one person, Wylie hoped to model his firm after Palantir Technologies, the CIA-backed, Silicon Valley data-mining company.","“He was very much trying to build this company and his vision was, ‘I want to build SCL without [Cambridge Analytica CEO] Alexander Nix,’” said one person who talked to Wylie about his new venture. Last week, Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix pending an investigation after he was recorded by the UK’s Channel 4 touting his firm’s ability to influence foreign elections and discussing techniques to entrap and blackmail political candidates. Cambridge Analytica did not return a request for comment.","By the beginning of 2014, Wylie had put together a presentation for a company called Arg.us. According to its pitch deck, which was seen and published in part by BuzzFeed News, the company said it could ingest users' social media activity to build “psychographic” profiles for marketers who could then target ads to specific users and possibly influence behavior. By the winter of that year, Wylie was having conversations about his idea with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including one who spoke to BuzzFeed News and received a note that said the products that Wylie had promised had been used for previous political clients.","Wylie’s lawyer previously said that Arg.us presentation was “never a serious pitch,” and it’s not clear how it was used. That said, similarities in documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News suggest it was a precursor to Eunoia.","After leaving Cambridge Analytica and SCL in late June of 2014, Wylie pivoted his focus to Eunoia — Greek for “beautiful thinking” — formulating a company that could perform so-called psychographic modeling and targeting for its clients. By August, he was working at Eunoia with Tobias Kloepper, a one-time SCL data scientist who would obtain Facebook data for the young startup. Emails viewed by BuzzFeed News indicate that Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist and founder of GSR, shared a database of more than 50 million Facebook users with Kloepper.","Kogan and Kloepper did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unclear if Wylie ever used that data, with the whistleblower noting in front of a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that he eventually deleted it because “I wasn’t going to do anything with it.”","Correspondence between Wylie and an acquaintance from September 2014 show that, while Wylie was particularly interested in courting fashion industry clients, he claimed to also have meetings with Monsanto, the American Petroleum Institute, and Ford. A Eunoia fashion-focused presentation from the time obtained by BuzzFeed News said the company had a “database that contains the information of hundreds of millions of individual consumers with emails, Facebook/Twitter IDs and mailing addresses,” while a separate company brochure specifically discusses targeting voters for potential political clients. Neither document mentions the specific GSR data set of 50 million Facebook users, and it’s unclear if Eunoia ever put that data to use.","“The heart of our work stems from a rigorous scientific understanding of human behavior, which in turn allows us to engineer more responsive audiences and engage consumers more precisely,” read the brochure. “To do this, we have developed a series of algorithms that can predict the personality traits of individual voters by analyzing their voterfile [sic], social, online and consumer data.”","Neither the presentation nor the brochure mention the provenance of that \"social, online and consumer data.\"","Provided to BuzzFeed News","A presentation slide for fashion clients from Eunoia Technologies.","According to one person, GSR gave its data to Eunoia after Kogan had negotiated an agreement where the startup would receive the information without charge as part of a data-sharing agreement between the two parties. Wylie never provided Kogan with data of his own, this person said, and GSR moved to cancel its agreements with Eunoia in early 2015. Eunoia appears to never have officially launched; a separate source told BuzzFeed News that it was unable to secure funding.","Data On The Loose","The contested data set, which GSR harvested using a 2014 Facebook personality quiz where users permitted the app to obtain personal information about themselves and their friends, has kick-started investigations from governments around the world. In the US, multiple members of Congress have asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill about the social network’s data policies and how the information of more than 50 million users could have ended up in the hands of a company doing elections consulting work.","As BuzzFeed News has learned, the spread of the Facebook data was not confined to Cambridge Analytica. Wylie may have had access to the data set for more than a year after founding Eunoia, with Facebook only acting to address the violation of its rules in late 2015, after the release of a story in the Guardian. GSR was told to delete its data in December 2015, according to a source, while Wylie said in testimony in front a parliamentary committee Tuesday that he believed he deleted the GSR data “some time in 2015” after being contacted by Kogan.","Earlier this month, after learning that several outlets were working on stories about the Trump campaign–hired data analysis company, the social networking giant moved to suspend the Facebook accounts of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, and Wylie. Facebook declined to comment for this story.","\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post last Wednesday. He added that the company would investigate “all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014.” The company took out full-page ads in several newspapers last Sunday apologizing for the mistake.","Asked last week if Eunoia had used any data sets on Facebook users, Wylie’s lawyer, Allen, was adamant. “Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets,” she wrote.","Provided to BuzzFeed News","Eunoia business cards","Eunoia And Trump’s Campaign Manager","In an interview with NBC’s Today show last week, Wylie drew a line between Cambridge Analytica and Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “What I do know is that Cambridge Analytica was meeting with Corey Lewandowski in 2015 before Trump had even announced and offering the services that I’m talking about right now,” he said.","What Wylie didn’t say is that Eunoia Technologies also met with Lewandowski around the same time. According to one source, Lewandowski met with representatives of the company, including Tadas Jucikas, a former SCL employee, and Mark Gettleson, Eunoia’s communications and marketing strategist, around Easter Sunday 2015 in the lobby of a New York Central Park hotel. Wylie did not attend the meeting, said the person, but he was well aware of it and its purpose to discuss voter microtargeting for a possible presidential candidate.","Drew Angerer / Getty Images","Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski arrives at Trump Tower in December 2016 in New York City.","While Trump’s campaign went on to work with Cambridge Analytica later in 2016, the person said that Lewandowski met with Eunoia, in part, because the Alexander Nix operation was already working for Ted Cruz’s presidential election team at the time. According to that source, that meeting included “high-level discussions” about microtargeting techniques and did not include any talk about Facebook data.","Jucikas declined to comment. Gettleson did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including phone calls, emails, and a visit to his London home. Lewandowski, who became Trump’s official campaign manager when the billionaire announced his candidacy in June 2015, did not respond to a request for comment.","Emails obtained by BuzzFeed News further corroborate the pitch to the Trump campaign. In April 2015, following the meeting with Lewandowski, Gettleson, a political operative with UK’s liberal democratic party, sent an email with the subject line “Trump” to a graphic designer who had been designing business cards and brochures for the company. The email included an attachment labeled “Trump-Handout,” which contained a list of various political microtargeting products and services offered by the company. The graphic designer made a few adjustments to the document and placed its contents on official Eunoia stationery before sending it back to Gettleson in a PDF called “eunioa_stationary_introletter.” It’s unclear if these documents were then sent to Lewandowski or if Eunoia had any further meetings with Trump’s eventual campaign manager.","A cache of documents sent to BuzzFeed News by a source, which included business contracts and pitch decks, reveal other individuals who, to varying degrees, were associated with the fledgling startup. Many of those people did not want to talk about their involvement with the company or did not return BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment. Ray Larson, a former strategist for Canada’s liberal party, did not respond to emails and a phone message; Brent Clickard, a former colleague of Wylie’s at SCL declined to comment. A source close to Clickard said that while he spoke with Wylie about working at Eunoia, the pair never formalized an agreement.","Alfredas Chmieliauskas, a London-based employee of Palantir, said he had “no idea” why his name was on Eunoia’s business documents, adding that while Wylie knew “a former school friend of mine ... we never had a working relationship of any sort.” On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Chmieliauskas, while at Palantir, began corresponding with Wylie in 2013 and later gave him the idea to develop the quiz app, eventually employed by Kogan, to harvest Facebook user data. Wylie also visited with Palantir, with a company spokesperson later confirming that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica considered working together at one point.","Correspondence from Wylie that was given to BuzzFeed News show Wylie bragging to an acquaintance in late 2013 about the prospect of someone from Palantir wanting to join his idea for a startup.","It is not clear if these people, who denied having official work relationships with Eunoia or did not reply altogether, knew that the company had access to a data set with more than 50 million Facebook users or that its associates were meeting with potential presidential campaigns.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record.\"","According to a source, Eunoia also sought to hire Mark Block, the former chief of staff to 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain who had a brief spell of notoriety for smoking a cigarette in a campaign ad. Block’s name and that of his associate, Linda Hansen, were printed on a proof sheet of draft Eunoia business cards given to BuzzFeed News by a second source.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record,” Block said when asked about his relationship with Eunoia and Wylie. Block, who reportedly introduced Steve Bannon to SCL and worked for the company’s elections division as its head of US sales, according to an archived version of SCL’s website, declined to say anything more.","\"There were discussions about politics and some other ex [Cambridge Analytica] staff wanted to continue working in Republican politics,\" Wylie's lawyer said in an email to earlier questions last week. \"However they parted ways with Mr Wylie to set up their own company that does work for Republican clients. ... Mr Wylie has not worked for Republicans since leaving CA and does not wish to in the future.\""],"isopubdate":""}

According to Mr. Ombako, he had been thinking about a particular item most of the day and when he logged in into his Facebook, Facebook bombarded him with ads on the item he had been thinking about. Comments on the status update by his friends suggested that he wasn’t the only one who had experienced the same feeling.","The feeling that Facebook knows what you are thinking is not limited to Facebook. Early yesterday I was on my bed wondering, “is it true that US is actually the most popular country in the world? Or could it be it is just popular in English speaking countries? Is not true that English is not the most popular language globally?” Then I took to Google and typed, “The most popular” and as usual, Google completed my sentence with a list of suggestions as shown in the image below. I wondered, “how did Google know that I was thinking about countries?”","These seeming mind reading abilities by Facebook and Google are happening at a time when everyone is going berserk about the revelation that Cambridge Analytica mined Facebook user data and used that data to orchestrate political campaigns in several countries globally, including in the Kenyan 2017 Presidential elections. The accusation against Cambridge Analytica is that the company used algorithms to mine data from Facebook users, up to over 50 million of them, to know their likes, religious, political, social, and other interests. With this data at hand, the company went ahead to structure campaign ads targeting these users with political messages. In Kenya for example Cambridge Analytica was able to target Raila haters with anti-Raila hate messages, which many have argued swayed those who hated Raila into turning up to vote against the man. Right now Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are being crucified both in tribunals and in the courts of public opinion for their use of user data without direct consent of the users.","Alright, so Cambridge Analytica obtained my data without my consent and used that data to campaign for Uhuru Kenyatta on my Facebook Timeline. Do I think that helped Uhuru Kenyatta to win unfairly? No, I don’t. The use of Facebook data is not something that was a secret. That is, it is not like Cambridge Analytica entered into a secret pact with Facebook for Facebook to allow CA mine data from Facebook users for unfair targeted ads. Rather, anyone with the right tools to gather necessary data can do so to target particular group of Facebook users with tailored messages. Actually, one doesn’t need to hire Cambridge Analytica to achieve this. As a regular adversiter on Facebook, I know how I can target particular groups of Facebook users with messages I know would interest them, and have that message to reach them in a manner that will draw their attention to the message.","If Cambridge Analytica used targeted ads to reach anti-Raila (or anti-Obama in the 2016 US presidential elections), then Raila’s team ought to have reciprocated by targeting anti-Uhuru with targeted ads too. As far as I know, Facebook is an open platform where advertisers compete for ad space through a competitive bidding process; where the person who pays more for the ads and tailor their ads more appropriately have the highest chance of reaching their target audience. Jubilee hired Cambridge Analytica for their 2017 presidential campaigns because they knew CA knows how to circumvent the highly competitive Facebook ad space. Nothing prevented NASA from hiring an equally competent firm to manage their campaigns.","On the question of whether companies such as Cambridge Analytica ought to first seek direct permission from users on whether they can use their data for targeted campaigns, I answer, “that’s inconsequential”. There are people who are so much fixated on privacy until they forget that with globalization and the Internet, privacy is basically as dead as diskettes and wired telephone lines. For example, those who you, like me, who have their numbers everywhere online, what repercussions have you suffered? I remember this day when I gave my number to Safaricom publicly on Twitter. A friend replied to the tweet suggesting that I should be careful about giving out my number to the public. I didn’t care. Since then I have continued to give my number to anyone who asks, not via Inbox, PM, or DM, but directly through my Facebook Timeline, Page, or even in comment sections of popular pages like Daily Nation.","My private information that is available publicly is not limited to my phone number. Head over to Facebook and you’ll know where I currently work, the person I am engaged (married) to, things that I like and love, topics I like posting about, and a million and one other things about me. In addition to that, my Facebook account has over 4800 strangers added as friends (since the humans I practically know and are in my Facebook friendship list are less than 200 yet I have 5000 friends).","What I am trying to say is that it doesn’t really matter whether you are one of those who have set their Facebook posts to private or public. At the end of the day, your experience on Facebook and other online platforms doesn’t depend on the others, but how you relate to these online services. Do you posts things that allow strangers to troll and bully you? Want to dig you out until they know where you live? Or do you post things that are only relevant to the ears and eyes of those who know you not?","Privacy is it were is dead, and it is being buried within this decade. In the next decade or thereabout, Internet giants that will be (whether Facebook and Google or totally new companies), will not only know you based on what you have posted, but by what you think. As you read this right now, Facebook is busy working on technologies that will allow Facebook users to interact telepathically. That is, users of Facebook in the nearby future will be able to communicate with each other, not by typing or speaking through Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and/or WhatsApp, but by thinking. When this communication will come to fruition, Bob in Kenya will be able to put on his thinking cap and Jane in Japan will be able to receive Bob’s thoughts through her thinking cap – and vise versa.","When this technology will ripen, Facebook will not only be able to gather information about you based on the newly introduced “Answer question” section, but will also know about how you think, what you think, your feelings, desires, ambitions, dreams, visions, and personality as extracted from your brain waves. At that time, when you see an ad based on what you have been thinking, it won’t be a coincidence or statistical chance, but it will be because Facebook actually knows what you have been thinking about throughout the day.","That’s why you shouldn’t care a damn thing about privacy, but accept the current and future reality that we are no longer individuals with unique identities but statistical aggregations that must live collectively in an open world – a world without secrets.","And by the way, why are you so worried about Cambridge analytical using your private data for targeted ads when your sponsor or side chick can screen shot those private DMs, Inboxes and PMs and post them publicly for the rest of us to view as WhatsApp status updates?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

If the last week is anything to go by, he was right.","Since the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans had been harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, it has become increasingly apparent that the social network has been far more lax with its data sharing practices than many users realised.","As the scandal unfurled over the last seven days, Facebook’s lackluster response has highlighted a fundamental challenge for the company: how can it condemn the practice on which its business model depends?","“This is the story we have been waiting for so people will pay attention not just to Facebook but the entire surveillance economy,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","They may now regret it but they knowingly unleashed the forces that have led to this lack of trust and loss of privacy","Since Zuckerberg’s “dumb fucks” comment, Facebook has gone to great lengths to convince members of the public that it’s all about “connecting people” and “building a global community”. This pseudo-uplifting marketing speak is much easier for employees and users to stomach than the mission of “guzzling personal data so we can micro-target you with advertising”.","In the wake of the revelations that Cambridge Analytica misappropriated data collected by Dr Aleksandr Kogan under the guise of academic research, Facebook has scrambled to blame these rogue third parties for “platform abuse”. “The entire company is outraged we were deceived,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.","However, in highlighting the apparent deceit, the company has been forced to shine a light on its underlying business model and years of careless data sharing practices.","Sure, the data changed hands between the researcher and Cambridge Analytica in apparent violation of Kogan’s agreement with Facebook, but everything else was above board. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica got hold of and used to deliver targeted advertising based on personality types – including activities, interests, check-ins, location, photos, religion, politics, relationship details – was not unusual in the slightest.

It was a symbiotic relationship that was critical to Facebook’s growth.","“They wanted to push as much of the conversation, ad revenue and digital activity as possible and made it extremely friendly to app developers,” said Jeff Hauser, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Now they are complaining that the developers abused them. They wanted that. They were encouraging it. They may now regret it but they knowingly unleashed the forces that have led to this lack of trust and loss of privacy.”","The terms were updated in April 2014 to restrict the data new developers could get hold of, including people’s friends’ data, but only after four years of access to the Facebook firehose. Companies that plugged in before April 2014 had another year before access was restricted.","“There are all sorts of companies that are in possession of terabytes of information from before 2015,” said Hauser. “Facebook’s practices don’t bear up to close, informed scrutiny nearly as well as they look from the 30,000ft view, which is how people had been viewing Facebook previously.”","For too long consumers have thought about privacy on Facebook in terms of whether their ex-boyfriends or bosses could see their photos. However, as we fiddle around with our profile privacy settings, the real intrusions have been taking place elsewhere.","“In this sense, Facebook’s ‘privacy settings’ are a grand illusion. Control over post-sharing – people we share to – should really be called ‘publicity settings’,” explains Jonathan Albright, the research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “Likewise, control over passive sharing – the information people [including third party apps] can take from us – should be called ‘privacy settings’.”","Essentially Facebook gives us privacy “busywork” to make us think we have control, while making it very difficult to truly lock down our accounts.","‘The biggest issue I’ve ever seen’","Facebook is dealing with a PR minefield. The more it talks about its advertising practices, the more the #DeleteFacebook movement grows. Even the co-founder of WhatsApp Brian Acton, who profited from Facebook’s $19bn acquisition of his app, this week said he was deleting his account.","“This is the biggest issue I’ve ever seen any technology company face in my time,” said Roger McNamee, Zuckerberg’s former mentor.","“It’s not like tech hasn’t had a lot of scandals,” he said, mentioning the Theranos fraud case and MiniScribe packing actual bricks into boxes instead of hard drives. “But no one else has played a role in undermining democracy or the persecution of minorities before. This is a whole new ball game in the tech world and it’s really, really horrible.”","Facebook first discovered that Kogan had shared data with Cambridge Analytica when a Guardian journalist contacted the company about it at the end of 2015. It asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and revoked Kogan’s apps’ API access. However, Facebook relied on Cambridge Analytica’s word that they had done so.","Left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency","When the Observer contacted Facebook last week with testimony from a whistleblower stating that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted the data, Facebook’s reaction was to try to get ahead of the story by publishing its own disclosure late on Friday and sending a legal warning to try to prevent publication of its bombshell discoveries.","Then followed five days of virtual silence from the company, as the chorus of calls from critics grew louder, and further details of Facebook’s business dealings emerged.","A second whistleblower, the former Facebook manager Sandy Parakilas, revealed that he found Facebook’s lack of control over the data given to outside developers “utterly horrifying”. He told the Guardian that he had warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach, but that he was discouraged from investigating further.","At around the same time, it emerged that the co-director of the company that harvested the Facebook data before passing it to Cambridge Analytic is a current employee at Facebook. Joseph Chancellor worked alongside Kogan at Global Science Research, which exfiltrated the data using a personality app under the guise of academic research.","Demand for answers","Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic called for answers. In the US, the Democratic senator Mark Warner called for regulation, describing the online political advertising market as the “wild west”.","“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","The people owned the web, tech giants stole it. This is how we take it back | Jonathan Freedland","“I think they are in a very bad situation because they have long benefitted from the tech illiteracy of the political community,” said Hauser.","The backlash spooked investors, wiping almost $50bn off the valuation of the company in two days, although the stock has since rallied slightly.","On Wednesday, Zuckerberg finally broke his silence in a Facebook post acknowledging that the policies that allowed the misuse of data were a “breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it”.","The social network is facing calls for answers from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images","Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, added her own comment: “We know that this was a major violation of people’s trust, and I deeply regret that we didn’t do enough to deal with it.”","The company will investigate apps that had access to “large amounts of information” before the 2014 changes and audit thousands of apps that show “suspicious activity”. The company will also inform those whose data was “misused”, including people who were directly affected by the Kogan operation.","These actions don’t go far enough, said Vaidhyanathan.","“Facebook has a history of putting on that innocent little boy voice: ‘Oh I didn’t know that I shouldn’t hold the cat by its tail,’” he said. “I think we’re tired of it at this point.”","These problems were pointed out by scholars years ago, said Robyn Caplan, a researcher at Data & Society, but Facebook’s response was slow and insufficient.","“They have been trying to put out a lot of little fires but we need them to build a fire department,” she said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

I appreciate the possibilities that it has afforded people in connecting with disparate friends, family members, and total strangers. The transformation from a Hot or Not clone, to student directory, to the behemoth it is today is quite remarkable. As a coder and user of the Facebook Developer tools with experience running marketing campaigns on its Ad Suite, I have a more intimate relationship with Facebook than the typical user. With that in mind, I’m going to play a bit of a devil’s advocate and say something controversial:","While I agree that Facebook’s handling of their data was reckless, I don’t think they are entirely at fault. I also don’t think quitting Facebook is necessarily the answer, this incident is a symptom of a more pervasive and complex phenomena.","The news that Facebook had been used for dubious political ends during the last presidential campaign isn’t entirely breaking news. Many people had a sense that something was amiss on Facebook, Twitter, and Google during that time period. The big takeaway from The Guardian article (for me) were the details regarding the 320,000 seed accounts used to generate personality profiles for 51,200,000 people. As a user of the Facebook Graph API, I remembered something, the vulnerability that made this practice possible was removed back in spring 2015. The developer community knew this was a sketchy practice, made their concerns known, and Facebook did something about it.","Was it cavalier for Facebook to expose this level of data to the general public? Probably. Was Facebook intentionally up to no good? I really want to think probably not. According to the Mashable article, at the time of the API change “one of Facebook’s new slogans is ‘People First’, because “if people don’t feel comfortable using Facebook and specifically logging in to Facebook and using Facebook in apps, we don’t have a platform, we don’t have developers”. I think that sentiment might also be applied to general users.","Illustration of Facebook’s Graph API","Around that time, Facebook was busy boasting about their Graph API and its underlying data model which allows for faster recall of pertinent data across its massive infrastructure. The very weakness that exposed the profile data for millions of people, is a part of the system that facilitates the speedy display of your friend’s new likes and posts. My guess here is that Facebook released their Graph API as a mirror of their internal workings, not fully understanding the significance of making these features available to public developers.","Technological advances are always a double-edged sword, and its implications are not always fully obvious.","Some quick examples:","The Combustable EngineGood: Convenient Transportation of Goods & ServicesBad: Climate Change (If you believe in that sort of thing)","GMOsGood: Able to grow more crops and feed more peopleBad: Unintended health effects, Lack of Biodiversity","Smart PhonesGood: The world’s knowledge at the palm of your handsBad: Duckface Selfies","You get the idea.","Neither a smile nor a frown…","Another thing to note, your personal consumer profile has been around before the days of Facebook and will be long afterward. Unfortunately, the data various entities have on you is not a single instance that you can conveniently delete. (Start-up idea?) Typically, this information is used for benign or at very least mildly annoying marketing purposes. I recall a story from Charles Duhigg’s book The Power of Habit, How Target Knew a Teenager Was Pregnant Before Her Dad. How did Target get this spooky information? It was statistically gleaned from the girl’s Guest ID and her purchasing habits over a certain amount of time. The trouble is, Cambridge Analytica had weaponized this sort of information, and here we are, wondering how it was possible a reality TV star and failed business tycoon became President of the United States.","The genie is now out of the bottle, so what can we do from here? I think this sort of phenomena will be a bit like the flu. There will be new strains and permutations, but there are solid and lasting ways to protect yourself and others. I think the rule of thumb for folks to remember: Every action you take in public or online is likely being recorded in some fashion. You needn’t wear a foil hat, discard every electronic gizmo, and delete every profile, I think being aware of this fact and making adjustments to your habits are enough. You might think twice about getting an Echo or Alexa from Amazon. You might tweak the privacy settings on your phone. You might go so far as putting a sticker on your computer’s camera, or making your screen greyscale to make it seem less appealing. At the end of the day, using all of this miraculous technology is still a choice that comes with trade-offs.","Still from the movie They Live","Since it’s a given that you are being watched and marketed to (targeted) the best thing to do is be actively informed, aware, and cautious of the media that you are being exposed to. The most effective messaging works by tapping into your most basic negative emotions, Inadequacy, Loneliness, Sadness, and most powerfully Fear. Try to find sources of information that are even-keeled in their presentation and approach. Typically the more boring seeming, the more balanced. As a society, we in the United States have a plenty of room for improvement in this area, as illustrated by the amount of people that think articles from The Onion are real. Be cautious of the knee-jerk reactions you have when reading certain headlines. If something shocks you to attention, run a quick Google search to make sure the information is legit.","Even if I feel they are not completely at fault, the companies and organizations that manage our data have a responsibility to explore the implications of their technologies and safeguard our data wherever possible. If it’s been found that certain people have allowed things to happen under their watch, they should surely be held accountable. One thing Google, Twitter, and Facebook could do right now that would mitigate the damage, would be to leverage their powerful platforms to encourage people to take part in their own government by getting people registered to vote, informing them of polling places and times, and generally advocating for voter’s rights.","Finally, if you’ve deleted your Facebook account, more power to you, I’ll be there to be your “friend” if and when you return.","Data Driven Investor (DDI) brings you various news and op-ed pieces in the areas of technologies, finance, and society.

These Russian oil giant executives held at least three meetings with the firm in London and Turkey, and they were particularly interested in learning how data is used to target Americans.","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and was involved in the Lukoil meetings, corroborated this by hinting that the executives wanted the use the company’s data gathering to send a message to voters.","From the report.","“I kept asking Alexander, ‘Can you explain to me what they want?’” he said, referring to Mr. Nix. “I don’t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.”","“We’re sending them stuff about political targeting — they then come and ask more about political targeting,” Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil “just didn’t seem to be interested” in how the techniques could be used commercially.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix denied that the firm ever worked with Russia when asked during a recent hearing before the British Parliament.","“As far as I’m aware, we’ve never worked for a Russian company,” Nix said. “We’ve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country, and we don’t have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","Months ago, there was a great deal of intrigue regarding the news that Cambridge Analytica reached out to Julian Assange during the election. The firm was asking the Wikileaks founder for help in finding Hillary Clinton‘s missing emails."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

{"originalurl":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/can-reading-make-you-happier","title":"Can Reading Make You Happier? | The New Yorker","text":["Can Reading Make You Happier?","For all avid readers who have been self-medicating with great books their entire lives, it comes as no surprise that reading books can be good for you.","ILLUSTRATION BY SARAH MAZZETTI","Several years ago, I was given as a gift a remote session with a bibliotherapist at the London headquarters of the School of Life, which offers innovative courses to help people deal with the daily emotional challenges of existence. I have to admit that at first I didn’t really like the idea of being given a reading “prescription.” I’ve generally preferred to mimic Virginia Woolf’s passionate commitment to serendipity in my personal reading discoveries, delighting not only in the books themselves but in the randomly meaningful nature of how I came upon them (on the bus after a breakup, in a backpackers’ hostel in Damascus, or in the dark library stacks at graduate school, while browsing instead of studying). I’ve long been wary of the peculiar evangelism of certain readers: You must read this, they say, thrusting a book into your hands with a beatific gleam in their eyes, with no allowance for the fact that books mean different things to people—or different things to the same person—at various points in our lives. I loved John Updike’s stories about the Maples in my twenties, for example, and hate them in my thirties, and I’m not even exactly sure why.","But the session was a gift, and I found myself unexpectedly enjoying the initial questionnaire about my reading habits that the bibliotherapist, Ella Berthoud, sent me. Nobody had ever asked me these questions before, even though reading fiction is and always has been essential to my life. I love to gorge on books over long breaks—I’ll pack more books than clothes, I told Berthoud. I confided my dirty little secret, which is that I don’t like buying or owning books, and always prefer to get them from the library (which, as I am a writer, does not bring me very good book-sales karma). In response to the question “What is preoccupying you at the moment?,” I was surprised by what I wanted to confess: I am worried about having no spiritual resources to shore myself up against the inevitable future grief of losing somebody I love, I wrote. I’m not religious, and I don’t particularly want to be, but I’d like to read more about other people’s reflections on coming to some sort of early, weird form of faith in a “higher being” as an emotional survival tactic. Simply answering the questions made me feel better, lighter.","We had some satisfying back-and-forths over e-mail, with Berthoud digging deeper, asking about my family’s history and my fear of grief, and when she sent the final reading prescription it was filled with gems, none of which I’d previously read. Among the recommendations was “The Guide,” by R. K. Narayan. Berthoud wrote that it was “a lovely story about a man who starts his working life as a tourist guide at a train station in Malgudi, India, but then goes through many other occupations before finding his unexpected destiny as a spiritual guide.” She had picked it because she hoped it might leave me feeling “strangely enlightened.” Another was “The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,” by José Saramago: “Saramago doesn’t reveal his own spiritual stance here but portrays a vivid and compelling version of the story we know so well.” “Henderson the Rain King,” by Saul Bellow, and “Siddhartha,” by Hermann Hesse, were among other prescribed works of fiction, and she included some nonfiction, too, such as “The Case for God,” by Karen Armstrong, and “Sum,” by the neuroscientist David Eagleman, a “short and wonderful book about possible afterlives.”","I worked my way through the books on the list over the next couple of years, at my own pace—interspersed with my own “discoveries”—and while I am fortunate enough to have my ability to withstand terrible grief untested, thus far, some of the insights I gleaned from these books helped me through something entirely different, when, over several months, I endured acute physical pain. The insights themselves are still nebulous, as learning gained through reading fiction often is—but therein lies its power. In a secular age, I suspect that reading fiction is one of the few remaining paths to transcendence, that elusive state in which the distance between the self and the universe shrinks. Reading fiction makes me lose all sense of self, but at the same time makes me feel most uniquely myself. As Woolf, the most fervent of readers, wrote, a book “splits us into two parts as we read,” for “the state of reading consists in the complete elimination of the ego,” while promising “perpetual union” with another mind.","Bibliotherapy is a very broad term for the ancient practice of encouraging reading for therapeutic effect. The first use of the term is usually dated to a jaunty 1916 article in The Atlantic Monthly, “A Literary Clinic.” In it, the author describes stumbling upon a “bibliopathic institute” run by an acquaintance, Bagster, in the basement of his church, from where he dispenses reading recommendations with healing value. “Bibliotherapy is…a new science,” Bagster explains. “A book may be a stimulant or a sedative or an irritant or a soporific. The point is that it must do something to you, and you ought to know what it is. A book may be of the nature of a soothing syrup or it may be of the nature of a mustard plaster.” To a middle-aged client with “opinions partially ossified,” Bagster gives the following prescription: “You must read more novels. Not pleasant stories that make you forget yourself. They must be searching, drastic, stinging, relentless novels.” (George Bernard Shaw is at the top of the list.) Bagster is finally called away to deal with a patient who has “taken an overdose of war literature,” leaving the author to think about the books that “put new life into us and then set the life pulse strong but slow.”","Today, bibliotherapy takes many different forms, from literature courses run for prison inmates to reading circles for elderly people suffering from dementia. Sometimes it can simply mean one-on-one or group sessions for “lapsed” readers who want to find their way back to an enjoyment of books. Berthoud and her longtime friend and fellow bibliotherapist Susan Elderkin mostly practice “affective” bibliotherapy, advocating the restorative power of reading fiction. The two met at Cambridge University as undergraduates, more than twenty years ago, and bonded immediately over the shared contents of their bookshelves, in particular Italo Calvino’s novel “If on a Winter’s Night a Traveller,” which is itself about the nature of reading. As their friendship developed, they began prescribing novels to cure each other’s ailments, such as a broken heart or career uncertainty. “When Suse was having a crisis about her profession—she wanted to be a writer, but was wondering if she could cope with the inevitable rejection—I gave her Don Marquis’s ‘Archy and Mehitabel’ poems,” Berthoud told me. “If Archy the cockroach could be so dedicated to his art as to jump on the typewriter keys in order to write his free-verse poems every night in the New York offices of the Evening Sun, then surely she should be prepared to suffer for her art, too.” Years later, Elderkin gave Berthoud,who wanted to figure out how to balance being a painter and a mother, Patrick Gale’s novel “Notes from an Exhibition,” about a successful but troubled female artist.","They kept recommending novels to each other, and to friends and family, for many years, and, in 2007, when the philosopher Alain de Botton, a fellow Cambridge classmate, was thinking about starting the School of Life, they pitched to him the idea of running a bibliotherapy clinic. “As far as we knew, nobody was doing it in that form at the time,” Berthoud said. “Bibliotherapy, if it existed at all, tended to be based within a more medical context, with an emphasis on self-help books. But we were dedicated to fiction as the ultimate cure because it gives readers a transformational experience.”","Berthoud and Elderkin trace the method of bibliotherapy all the way back to the Ancient Greeks, “who inscribed above the entrance to a library in Thebes that this was a ‘healing place for the soul.’ ” The practice came into its own at the end of the nineteenth century, when Sigmund Freud began using literature during psychoanalysis sessions. After the First World War, traumatized soldiers returning home from the front were often prescribed a course of reading. “Librarians in the States were given training on how to give books to WWI vets, and there’s a nice story about Jane Austen’s novels being used for bibliotherapeutic purposes at the same time in the U.K.,” Elderkin says. Later in the century, bibliotherapy was used in varying ways in hospitals and libraries, and has more recently been taken up by psychologists, social and aged-care workers, and doctors as a viable mode of therapy.","There is now a network of bibliotherapists selected and trained by Berthoud and Elderkin, and affiliated with the School of Life, working around the world, from New York to Melbourne. The most common ailments people tend to bring to them are the life-juncture transitions, Berthoud says: being stuck in a rut in your career, feeling depressed in your relationship, or suffering bereavement. The bibliotherapists see a lot of retirees, too, who know that they have twenty years of reading ahead of them but perhaps have only previously read crime thrillers, and want to find something new to sustain them. Many seek help adjusting to becoming a parent. “I had a client in New York, a man who was having his first child, and was worried about being responsible for another tiny being,” Berthoud says. “I recommended ‘Room Temperature,’ by Nicholson Baker, which is about a man feeding his baby a bottle and having these meditative thoughts about being a father. And of course 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' because Atticus Finch is the ideal father in literature.”","Berthoud and Elderkin are also the authors of “The Novel Cure: An A-Z of Literary Remedies,” which is written in the style of a medical dictionary and matches ailments (“failure, feeling like a”) with suggested reading cures (“The History of Mr. Polly,” by H. G. Wells). First released in the U.K. in 2013, it is now being published in eighteen countries, and, in an interesting twist, the contract allows for a local editor and reading specialist to adapt up to twenty-five per cent of the ailments and reading recommendations to fit each particular country’s readership and include more native writers. The new, adapted ailments are culturally revealing. In the Dutch edition, one of the adapted ailments is “having too high an opinion of your own child”; in the Indian edition, “public urination” and “cricket, obsession with” are included; the Italians introduced “impotence,” “fear of motorways,” and “desire to embalm”; and the Germans added “hating the world” and “hating parties.” Berthoud and Elderkin are now working on a children’s-literature version, “A Spoonful of Stories,” due out in 2016.","For all avid readers who have been self-medicating with great books their entire lives, it comes as no surprise that reading books can be good for your mental health and your relationships with others, but exactly why and how is now becoming clearer, thanks to new research on reading’s effects on the brain. Since the discovery, in the mid-nineties, of “mirror neurons”—neurons that fire in our brains both when we perform an action ourselves and when we see an action performed by someone else—the neuroscience of empathy has become clearer. A 2011 study published in the Annual Review of Psychology, based on analysis of fMRI brain scans of participants, showed that, when people read about an experience, they display stimulation within the same neurological regions as when they go through that experience themselves. We draw on the same brain networks when we’re reading stories and when we’re trying to guess at another person’s feelings.","Other studies published in 2006 and 2009 showed something similar—that people who read a lot of fiction tend to be better at empathizing with others (even after the researchers had accounted for the potential bias that people with greater empathetic tendencies may prefer to read novels). And, in 2013, an influential study published in Science found that reading literary fiction (rather than popular fiction or literary nonfiction) improved participants’ results on tests that measured social perception and empathy, which are crucial to “theory of mind”: the ability to guess with accuracy what another human being might be thinking or feeling, a skill humans only start to develop around the age of four.","Keith Oatley, a novelist and emeritus professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Toronto, has for many years run a research group interested in the psychology of fiction. “We have started to show how identification with fictional characters occurs, how literary art can improve social abilities, how it can move us emotionally, and can prompt changes of selfhood,” he wrote in his 2011 book, “Such Stuff as Dreams: The Psychology of Fiction.” “Fiction is a kind of simulation, one that runs not on computers but on minds: a simulation of selves in their interactions with others in the social world…based in experience, and involving being able to think of possible futures.” This idea echoes a long-held belief among both writers and readers that books are the best kinds of friends; they give us a chance to rehearse for interactions with others in the world, without doing any lasting damage. In his 1905 essay “On Reading,” Marcel Proust puts it nicely: “With books there is no forced sociability. If we pass the evening with those friends—books—it’s because we really want to. When we leave them, we do so with regret and, when we have left them, there are none of those thoughts that spoil friendship: ‘What did they think of us?’—‘Did we make a mistake and say something tactless?’—‘Did they like us?’—nor is there the anxiety of being forgotten because of displacement by someone else.”","George Eliot, who is rumored to have overcome her grief at losing her life partner through a program of guided reading with a young man who went on to become her husband, believed that “art is the nearest thing to life; it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot.” But not everybody agrees with this characterization of fiction reading as having the ability to make us behave better in real life. In her 2007 book, “Empathy and the Novel,” Suzanne Keen takes issue with this “empathy-altruism hypothesis,” and is skeptical about whether empathetic connections made while reading fiction really translate into altruistic, prosocial behavior in the world. She also points out how hard it is to really prove such a hypothesis. “Books can’t make change by themselves—and not everyone feels certain that they ought to,” Keen writes. “As any bookworm knows, readers can also seem antisocial and indolent. Novel reading is not a team sport.” Instead, she urges, we should enjoy what fiction does give us, which is a release from the moral obligation to feel something for invented characters—as you would for a real, live human being in pain or suffering—which paradoxically means readers sometimes “respond with greater empathy to an unreal situation and characters because of the protective fictionality.” And she wholeheartedly supports the personal health benefits of an immersive experience like reading, which “allows a refreshing escape from ordinary, everyday pressures.”","So even if you don’t agree that reading fiction makes us treat others better, it is a way of treating ourselves better. Reading has been shown to put our brains into a pleasurable trance-like state, similar to meditation, and it brings the same health benefits of deep relaxation and inner calm. Regular readers sleep better, have lower stress levels, higher self-esteem, and lower rates of depression than non-readers. “Fiction and poetry are doses, medicines,” the author Jeanette Winterson has written. “What they heal is the rupture reality makes on the imagination.”","One of Berthoud’s clients described to me how the group and individual sessions she has had with Berthoud have helped her cope with the fallout from a series of calamities, including losing her husband, the end of a five-year engagement, and a heart attack. “I felt my life was without purpose,” she says. “I felt a failure as a woman.” Among the books Berthoud initially prescribed was John Irving’s novel “The Hotel New Hampshire.” “He was a favorite writer of my husband, [whom] I had felt unable to attempt for sentimental reasons.” She was “astounded and very moved” to see it on the list, and though she had avoided reading her husband’s books up until then, she found reading it to be “a very rewarding emotional experience, both in the literature itself and ridding myself of demons.” She also greatly appreciated Berthoud guiding her to Tom Robbins’s novel “Jitterbug Perfume,” which was “a real learning curve for me about prejudice and experimentation.”","One of the ailments listed in “The Novel Cure” is “overwhelmed by the number of books in the world,” and it’s one I suffer from frequently. Elderkin says this is one of the most common woes of modern readers, and that it remains a major motivation for her and Berthoud’s work as bibliotherapists. “We feel that though more books are being published than ever before, people are in fact selecting from a smaller and smaller pool. Look at the reading lists of most book clubs, and you’ll see all the same books, the ones that have been shouted about in the press. If you actually calculate how many books you read in a year—and how many that means you’re likely to read before you die—you’ll start to realize that you need to be highly selective in order to make the most of your reading time.” And the best way to do that? See a bibliotherapist, as soon as you can, and take them up on their invitation, to borrow some lines from Shakespeare’s “Titus Andronicus”: \"Come, and take choice of all my library/And so beguile thy sorrow…\""],"isopubdate":""}

Maybe think twice.","UpdatedUpdated 19 March","By\nKelsey Munro","Share","What happened?","Data firm Cambridge Analytica is fast becoming a house-hold name after two media outlets revealed its involvement in Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica has been accused of harvesting the data of some 50 million Facebook users' profiles without their knowledge to help it design software to predict and influence voters’ choices at the ballot box.","Just hours before the Observer and the New York Times broke the story over the weekend, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform, pending an investigation, in an apparent pre-emptive strike to limit the damage to its own brand.","The tech giant has announced a review into the potential privacy breach as it comes under intense scrutiny by US and British politcians. Cambridge Analytica, meanwhile, has said it deleted the data before it even started work on the Trump campaign.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix will now face another grilling by British politicians, while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned to speak to a UK House of Commons committee about the misuse of data.","Why do we care?","Well, because so many of us are on Facebook, which has built its entire massive business on its users’ data - their likes, networks, locations and browsing histories. Facebook is free to you, because you are not the customer but the product. Your data, aggregated with millions of others', is an incredibly powerful tool for anyone who wants to convince a lot of people to vote for someone or buy something.","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.","Christopher Wylie","In the words of Christopher Wylie, the Canadian data analytics specialist and whistle-blower that created the system and now, deeply troubled by its consequences, has exposed it: “I built Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindf--k tool.” Steve Bannon was the driving force behind the election of Donald Trump, one of the most disruptive and controversial presidents in US history.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" Wylie told the Observer.","This appears to be the starkest example yet of how social media is being used for political purposes at the highest levels.","How did it work?","The New York Times reports that Cambridge Analytica spent US$800,000 in 2014 to get Russian-American academic Aleksandr Kogan to build an app to harvest the data of Facebook users. He created a personality quiz called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it. 270,000-odd people downloaded the app.","According to Facebook, users consent for their information to be used simply by downloading the app, but media reports said it also extracted the personal data of each of those users’ friends, unbeknown to them.","Aleksandr Kogan then passed all the data his app collected on some 50 million users onto Cambridge Analytica and other companies. Of those accounts, sufficient data had been gleaned to create psychographic profiles on 30 million of them, which it used to understand and influence voter behaviour for its clients.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 when it learned of the violations, and told everyone who received the misappropriated data to destroy it. But it has now emerged from several sources speaking to several media outlets that the data had not been deleted.","Facebook has since pushed back a bit, quibbling that it was “not a data breach.” The tech giant's deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said in the company’s statement that all misused data was “knowingly provided” by users, and did not extend to those users’ Facebook friends - or at least not to those who had privacy settings turned on.","But Facebook has suspended it anyway because it violated Facebook’s rules when the data was handed to a third party - Cambridge Analytica - for targeting political ads.","Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned over data breach.","AFP Karen Bleier","Who is Cambridge Analytica?","Set up in London in 2013, Cambridge Analytica purports to help its clients “change audience behaviour” using consumer data from social media and polling combined with behavioural science. Its right wing founder Alexander Nix told the website Contagious that it was set up “to address the vacuum in the US Republican political market” after Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat.","\"It is sort of like the digital shadow of yourself. So, when you think about what you do on social media, you curate your identity.\"","\"Cambridge Analytica will try to pick at whatever mental weakness or vulnerability that we think you have and try to warp your perception of what's real around you,\" he said.","The firm was bankrolled to the tune of $15 million by US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, a major Republican donor. At the time, Steve Bannon - a top Trump adviser until he was fired last summer - was a director of the company.","Following the suspension on the weekend, the company said it was in touch with Facebook \"in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible ,\" denying it violated Facebook’s terms of service. It blamed the misuse of data on Aleksandr Kogan and said it has since deleted all the data it received from a company he founded, Global Science Research.","What is the Trump connection?","Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had boasted that he brought in Cambridge Analytica to help win the 2016 US Presidential election for Mr Trump, according to the New York Times. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia during the election, thinks the company could be a key link in his case. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Mr Mueller has ordered Cambridge Analytica to turn over internal documents.","The company has sought quickly to hose down the Trump connection, claiming that none of the data obtained through Kogan and Global Science Research “was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","But Robert Mueller is not expected to let this one go.","What does this mean for Facebook users?","The compromise of 50 million users’ data raises a lot of questions over whether, as Facebook said in its statement: “protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do.” The company was already under fire over the way its news feed was effectively gamed to spread deliberate misinformation deployed by Russian interests to sway voters during the 2016 US election campaign - another huge blow to its reputation.","Facebook has not informed users whose data was compromised of the fact. Going forward, even if third party apps obtain users' data legitimately according to Facebook's own rules, they may then be acquired by other companies who use it, in breach of the rules.","So the social media platform’s 2.2 billion users may well be wondering how safe their data is, and whether the company has undertaken any systemic action to stop misuse when it has clearly known about this problem for a few years, but only acted on Friday ahead of media exposure.","What happens now?","In the UK, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are already the subject of an inquiry into data and politics by the Information Commissioner’s Office and another one by the Electoral Commission to investigate what role it played in the Brexit referendum (the company has said it did not work for the ‘Leave’ vote, but this has been contradicted by the co-founder of Leave.EU, Arron Banks).","In the US, Democrat senators called for new regulations on Facebook over the weekend, and some Republican senators questioned the company’s actions. But it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would act. Facebook said it was conducting a thorough internal review.","Australian connection","The data mining firm has been trying to expand its operations overseas, including in Australia. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Australia at a property in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra; however, the man who registered the firm said it has never conducted any business here.","But in April 2017, Senator Dan Tehan was among a group of Liberal politicians who met an executive from Cambridge Analytica.

He denies the claims.","Also in attendance at the meetings were Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, and the company’s chief data officer, Dr Alex Tayler.","Mr Turnbull described how Cambridge Analytica could gather damaging material on opponents and discreetly post it on social media and the internet.","He said: “... we just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then, and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again… like a remote control. It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘that’s propaganda’, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’, the next question is, ‘who’s put that out?’”.","The executives were also filmed saying Cambridge Analytica and its parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories had worked on more than two hundred elections across the world, including in Nigeria, Kenya, the Czech Republic, India and Argentina.","On Monday, the Information Commissioner's Office announced it was seeking a warrant to raid Cambridge Analytica and seize the company's servers.","World news in pictures","World news in pictures","1/50 18 September 2018","South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wave during a car parade in Pyongyang, North Korea,","Reuters","2/50 17 September 2018","Australia has launched a nationwide investigation into needles being hidden in strawberries.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University, thinks so. Silicon Valley and Seattle should pay attention.","Galloway is no socialist Luddite. He’s a veteran entrepreneur and beneficiary of the industry. He’s also author of “The Four,” a penetrating book about Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet.","“The Four” also come in for most of his wrath in this bracing, mandatory read in Esquire.","A few quotes to whet your appetite:","• “Having your firm weaponized by foreign adversaries to undermine our democratic election process is bad … really bad. During the 2016 election, Russian troll pages on Facebook paid to promote approximately three thousand political ads. Fabricated content reached 126 million users. It doesn’t stop there — the GRU, the Russian military-intelligence agency, has lately taken a more bipartisan approach to sowing chaos.”","• “Big tech learned from the sins of the original gangster, Microsoft. The colossus at times appeared to feel it was above trafficking in PR campaigns and lobbyists to soften its image among the public and regulators. In contrast, the Four promote an image of youth and idealism, coupled with evangelizing the world-saving potential of technology.”","• “Unlike Microsoft, which was typecast early on as the ‘Evil Empire,’ Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon have combined savvy public-relations efforts with sophisticated political lobbying operations — think Oprah Winfrey crossed with the Koch brothers — to make themselves nearly immune to the scrutiny endured by Microsoft.”","Galloway is not taken in, listing tax evasion and job destruction among the other transgressions of the Big Four. One could add the “tech bro” culture that is widely seen as hostile to women.","“Granted, we’ve seen job destruction before,” he writes. “But we’ve never seen companies quite this good at it.” This includes the gig economy and the exploitation of drivers by the likes of Uber.","Yet all that is not enough to require a Theodore Roosevelt-style trust busting. Big Tech’s greatest sins are locking in a winner-take-all economy, decimating the middle class and exercising monopoly-like powers that cause the free market to fail. Competition is stymied. Power is in the hands of too few.","This is the anti-democratic poison that caused the progressives of Roosevelt’s age to break up the likes of Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller’s trust that controlled 90 percent of the country’s oil. Although Galloway’s proposal isn’t specific, if it followed the Standard Oil model it would mean busting up Big Tech into multiple smaller, independent entities. Amazon Web Services would be one obvious target to spin off.","Given this laissez-faire moment, Galloway’s proposal will go nowhere. That doesn’t mean it won’t go anywhere ever, though. Moments change. It’s a useful thought exercise, not least for the Seattle area, which has benefited so much from Big Tech’s breakout. And it might be more than just an exercise: The Washington Post has been the toughest watchdog on the Trump administration, so it’s possible the president could come after its owner, Jeff Bezos.","To be fair, Fortune’s 2017 list of the world’s most admired companies placed Apple, Amazon and Alphabet in the top three slots (Starbucks was No. 6, followed by Microsoft). Yet the list is compiled by Korn Ferry, asking executives, directors and securities analysts. This is not vox populi.","An Axios-SurveyMonkey poll last month found that 55 percent of respondents were concerned that government isn’t doing enough to regulate Big Tech, an increase of 15 points in three months. Democrats, Republicans and independents all voiced more worry more than in the previous poll.","“That’s a seismic shift in the public’s perception of Silicon Valley over a short period of time,” Axios reported. “It shows how worried Americans are about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but it also reflects a growing anxiety about the potentially addictive nature of some of the tech companies’ products, as well as the relentless spread of fake news on their platforms.”","The findings bolster a poll last fall from another news site, The Verge, showing declining trust in Big Tech. Facebook, Twitter and Apple came out worst, with Microsoft and Amazon doing better. “Amazon is a ruthless corporate juggernaut that people love,” The Verge summarized.","That juggernaut has been very good to Seattle, growing to 45,000 well-paid jobs at its headquarters and helping fill the city treasury. (The downside to having what tech talent desires but being cheaper than the Bay Area is a staggering increase in house prices.)","Amazon can also claim to be a real employer nationwide — more than 300,000, including 90,000 from Whole Foods. (Microsoft employs more than 74,500 nationwide and about 47,000 in the Puget Sound region.)","While this is better than Facebook’s head count of 23,000, Amazon eradicates jobs, too. More than 514,000 jobs were lost at department stores alone between 2001 and this past December.","Also, much Amazon work is in warehouses. For example, the Phoenix “associate” wage is $12.45 an hour, according to Glassdoor.","For comparison’s sake, General Motors at its peak employed some 400,000 in the United States and Canada. In 1970, starting pay on the assembly line was around $26.60 in today’s dollars. Increases were built into the United Auto Workers contract, along with health care, pensions and other benefits.","This was commonplace in the America of that era, and with far more companies. Rising productivity was widely shared in wage growth, unlike today (the companion trend lines separated around 1973).","And don’t forget that Amazon’s enormous power doesn’t stop at the marketplace. More than 200 localities sought HQ2. Many, including the 20 finalists, appear willing to shower this wealthy company with incentives.","“Chicago proposed to let Amazon keep $1.3 billion in employee payroll taxes and spend this money as the company sees fit,” Galloway writes. “That’s right: Chicago offered to transfer its tax authority to Amazon and trusts the Seattle firm to allocate taxes in a manner best for Chicago’s residents.”","Galloway argues that a breakup of the Big Four would inject “oxygen” into the economy, improving competition and unleashing capital.","Maybe it would hold back Seattle even worse than did Microsoft’s “lost decade,” which some observers blame on the federal government’s antitrust prosecution (others say Microsoft got off too easy, avoiding a breakup). On the other hand, given Seattle’s strengths, a breakup might let dozens of new tech flowers bloom here.","But I’m afraid the trust busting needs to go far beyond Big Tech. Finance, media, telecom, airlines, railroads and health care are among the many sectors that have become too concentrated. This hurts competition, innovation, job creation and communities that lose headquarters. We also need breakthroughs beyond apps and tech devices, as well as public investment, that create good jobs.","The Gilded Age’s barons look stuffy in black-and-white photos. The moguls of our Digital Gilded Age dress like teenagers or men who accidentally misplaced their ties. Otherwise, the danger their enterprises pose to the economy and the nation is the same — maybe worse today, where enough of an ignorant nation can be swayed by social-media lies."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election.","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending information over misuse of data.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Nix told the same MPs: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office.","It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in the largest ever breach of Facebook data.","Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence he supplied to authorities in the UK and US includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he told the Observer. “That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile information, but it was for research purposes only.","So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing of Facebook data.","Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica told the Observer that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said.

I guess that’s all they have left,” he said.","Arabic cinema wins over movie-goers","Oscar-nominated Saudi Arabian director Haifaa Al-Mansour premiered her short film set in Riyadh, ‘The Wedding Singer’s Daughter,’ at the Venice Film Festival","Earlier in the year Ziad Doueiri was the first Lebanese film director to be nominated for an Oscar with his film ‘The Insult’","Updated 17 September 2018","REBECCA SPONG","September 18, 2018 23:29","0","LONDON: Arabic cinema has increasingly captured the imagination of movie-lovers around the world this year, with Arab film-makers winning award nominations and securing high-profile screenings at major film festivals.\nThis month the Oscar-nominated Saudi Arabian director Haifaa Al-Mansour premiered her short film set in Riyadh, “The Wedding Singer’s Daughter,” at the Venice Film Festival. Al-Mansour previously wrote and directed the film “Wadjda,” which was the first foreign-language Oscar entry from Saudi Arabia in 2014.\nEarlier in the year Ziad Doueiri was the first Lebanese film director to be nominated for an Oscar with his film “The Insult.”\n“Arab cinema’s profile has been on the rise. There are several different Arab movies being shown at Venice (film festival) this year,” said Joseph Fahim, an Egyptian film critic and the curator of this year’s London-based Safar Film Festival, which runs on Sept. 13-18.\nDaniel Gorman, the director of London’s biannual Shubbak festival, which showcases mainly contemporary Arabic culture, art and film, said he that has seen the appeal of Arabic film grow in the UK.\n“There is a huge interest and appetite for creative work coming from across the Arab world and there is strong interest in the UK to hear the voices of people from across the region, in an area that is generally represented in headlines in newspapers. Film is an excellent way of doing that,” he said.\nFestivals have played a vital role in boosting awareness of Arab film, he said.\n“(They) are able to bring new audiences to new work as they bring this concentrated moment of activity. A festival tends to have a bit more reach in terms of media coverage and audience awareness.\n“(It) brings people along to something which they might not go to as a one-off screening,” Gorman said, explaining how the Shubbak festival also works with local schools and community groups to increase access to Arabic film and art.\nThis year’s Safar film festival — which is in its fourth year and organized by the Arab British Center — has focused on the theme of literature and film in the Arab world.\nFahim has created a program that includes movies dating back to the 1960s that have been buried deep in their respective country’s archives, as well as new films that have not been screened in London yet.\nOne of the films included is the Tunisian “In the Land of Tararanni,” originally released in 1973 and based on a collection of short stories by Ali Dougai.\nIt was one of the more tricky recordings to track down, said Nadia El-Sebai, executive director at the Arab British Center.\n“There are films in this program that audiences will have no idea how many people it took to get that film,” she said, explaining the lengthy negotiations with ministries of culture, national archives and old friends and contacts to track down the much sought-after recordings.\nThere were other movies they had to give up on ever finding, including those lost in Syria or Iraq, or old versions of films that have not yet been digitised by national archives, she said.\nMore recent festival entries include this year’s Egyptian film “Poisonous Roses,” adapted from a 1990s cult novel, as well as the European premiere of the work of an Iraqi filmmaker — “Stories of Passers Through” — which traces the stories of Iraqis exiled from their country during the Saddam Hussein regime.\nThe literary theme of this year’s festival was chosen as a reaction to the growing popularity of contemporary Arab cinema, with the event’s organizers wanting to delve into the history of Arabic film.\n“We are delighted by the increasing access to Arabic cinema. There are more films plugged into the London film festival this year. We have other other festivals — the Shubbak festival (in London), and the Liverpool Arab Arts Festival,” said El-Sebai.\n“For this year’s edition we thought we would like to take the opportunity to go a little deeper into the history and heritage of Arabic cinema, and the industry,” she said.\n“Safar is taking place just before London Film Festival (LFF), which was another motivation for us to look at something a bit different as we are definitely going to see really amazing contemporary films at the London Film Festival,” she said.\nThe LFF — which begins on Oct. 10 — is set to feature work by Syrian filmmaker Soudade Kaadan as well as the Saudi Arabian director Mahmoud Sabbagh’s latest dark comedy “Amra and the Second Marriage,” among other Arab productions.\nFahim was also keen to use the Safar event as a way of bringing audiences’ attention to a broader range of Arabic movies, highlighting the heritage of the film industry.\n“It is reminding people that Arab cinema did not spring out today — there is a long history,” he said, adding that he wanted to question audience expectations.\n“There have been a flood of amazing images from Arab cinema being displayed at festivals and most critics had no idea what they were. The more I spoke to people, the more I realized that there is a certain expectation of what Arab movies should be,” he said.\n“We wanted to challenge what people expect from Arab cinema … I am tired of seeing Lawrence of Arabia a gazillion times on the big screen,” he said.\nHe said the selected films in the festival will hopefully challenge preconceptions. He referred to the inclusion of the 1964 Egyptian film — “The Search” — based on the writer Naguib Mahfouz’s novel. “It is a crime noir. It is essentially an existential noir and I don’t think many people will expect to see that,” he said.\nArabic cinema, however, needs to be better promoted, he said, noting a dearth of adequate film critics.\n“At the big festivals it sometimes feels like Arab cinema is the bottom priority for critics,” he said.\n“We need more perceptive writing. I could name you on one hand the film critics who know their stuff. That needs to change. Maybe we need to have more different voices. Film criticism is still being dominated by white male writers — although it has been developing — but that is still the norm,” he said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

They are said to be similar to the ones maintained by Mr Comey.","In his tweet, Mr Trump also used the opportunity to attack Mr Comey as “sanctimonious” and called Mr McCabe’s firing “a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.” He asserted without elaboration that `Mr McCabe “knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI.”","Responding to that, Mr Brennan, who led the CIA under President Barack Obama between 2013 and 2017, made his feelings clear about the reasons for Mr McCabe’s firing by tweeting about Mr Trump: “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And that paralysis is, remarkably quickly, leading people to reassess their relationship with the site as a whole. The teens got there first, really. Facebook usage among younger people has been declining for years, in the face of competition from upstart rivals such as Snapchat, internal disruption from Facebook-owned Instagram, and a general sense that Facebook is full of old people and parents. But the backlash isn’t a generational thing any more. We’re all losing control of our data, both online and off, and we’re starting to kick back.","Not only is the burgeoning #deletefacebook movement picking up steam (although it will take a few weeks before hard numbers are available about how many have followed through on their words), but people are also beginning to look up, as if from a daydream, to ask: how exactly did we end up in this situation? Why did we give up our privacy so willingly? And how can we get it back?","The Guardian view on big tech: a new era needs new rules | Editorial","Read more","The 50m profiles harvested from Facebook by a Cambridge Analytica partner under the guise of research are a huge data store, but they pale in comparison with the amount of information the company holds on its own users. At the same time that Facebook turned off the spigot that had been used to pump industrial quantities of data off its platform, the company opened up a second set of floodgates: the Facebook Audience Network, which allows third parties to track, profile and advertise to Facebook users wherever they find them on the internet.","Facebook isn’t really a social network. It’s barely even an advertising company. It’s a data analytics firm, which manages to use its position as the middleman for a vast proportion of all human communication to find out everything there is to know about its users.","Just as Cambridge Analytica claimed enormous powers of perception with a scant selection of personal information, Facebook also boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users – and how effective it can be at influencing their minds: it cites a games company that “made video adverts to match different gamer styles” for a “63% increase in purchase intent”; a clothes retailer that achieved “a dramatic increase in sales” with “richly personalised ads”; and a mobile network that scored “a major boost in awareness and purchase intent” by focusing on users with families. (Facebook used to have a similar page on which it showed off to politicians about how effective it was at swinging elections, but it quietly removed that in February.)","If you think you’re a passive user of Facebook, minimising the data you provide to the site or refraining from oversharing details of your life, you have probably underestimated the scope of its reach. Facebook doesn’t just learn from the pictures you post, and the comments you leave: the site learns from which posts you read and which you don’t; it learns from when you stop scrolling down your feed and how long it takes you to restart; it learns from your browsing on other websites that have nothing to do with Facebook itself; and it even learns from the messages you type out then delete before sending (the company published an academic paper on this “self-censorship” back in 2013).","Facebook boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users – and how it can influence their minds","This data life isn’t limited to Facebook. Google, famously, is in the same basic business, although the company is a bit more transparent about it (for a shock, try going to the “My Activity” and “Location History” pages to be vividly reminded that Google is tracking everything). And Amazon is building a modern surveillance panopticon, replete with an always-on microphone for your kitchen and a jaunty camera for your bedroom, purely to sell you more stuff.","Avoiding the big players doesn’t help much. Large data brokers such as Experian and Equifax exist to collate information about everyone, whether or not they’re online. The security services continue to build their own surveillance databases, with powers strengthened in the UK through the recent Investigatory Powers Act. Even going to church now comes with the potential for a dose of surveillance: the Church of England has authorised the roll-out of 14,000 contactless card readers, to let parishioners give without carrying cash. Is it time to say goodbye to the anonymity of the collection plate, and hope you’re one of the more generous donors?","Richard Stallman has been warning of this state of affairs since before Zuckerberg even touched his first computer. The veteran computer scientist, creator of the GNU operating system and leader of the Free Software Movement, warns that “the only database that is not dangerous is the one that is never collected”.","“There is a limit on the level of surveillance that democracy can co-exist with, and we’re far above that,” he tells me on the phone from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We suffer more surveillance than the inhabitants of the Soviet Union, and we need to push it way down.","“Any database of personal data will be misused, if a misuse can be imagined by humans. It can be misused by the organisation that collects the data. In many cases, the purpose of collecting it is to misuse it, as in the case of Facebook, but also in the case of Amazon, Google to some extent, and thousands of smaller companies as well.","“It can also be misused by rogue employees of the company and it can also be stolen by some third party and misused. There’d be no danger of data breaches if a database doesn’t exist. And, finally, it can be taken by the state and misused.”","Stallman has little sympathy for those who choose to use such services. “They’re foolish,” he says, when I ask him why he thinks data harvesting is tacitly accepted by so many people. “They’re accustomed to a certain kind of convenience ... they choose to ignore that it might be dangerous.”","I’m less certain that there’s a choice being made at all, though. Yes, people may regularly be accepting terms and conditions that require them to give up their data, but that doesn’t mean they read them. I should know: I have. A few years ago, I decided to read, in full, the small print for every single product or service I used. I read almost 150,000 words of legalese – three-quarters of Moby Dick – in less than a week, from the 21,000 words required to turn off the alarm on my iPhone on a Monday morning to the 4,000 words required to browse BuzzFeed in my lunch break.","The experience was gruesome. Legal documents are not written to be read by humans, and certainly not to be read back-to-back in a harrowing marathon of End-User Licence Agreements. But I did learn one thing, which is that the modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations.","Lukasz Olejnik, an independent security and privacy researcher, agrees: “Years ago, people and organisations used to shift the blame on the users, even in public. This blaming is unfortunate, because expecting users to be subject-matter experts and versed in the obscure technical aspects is misguided.","“Blaming users is an oversimplification, as most do not understand the true implications when data are shared – they cannot. You can’t expect people to fully appreciate the amount of information extracted from aggregated datasets. That said, you can’t expect users to know what is really happening with their data if it’s not clearly communicated in an informed consent prompt, which should in some cases include also the consequences of hitting ‘I agree’.”","He adds that at many organisations, privacy was not being taken seriously, “except when there was a need to include the phrase ‘We take the privacy of our users very seriously’ following a data breach”.","The modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations","It doesn’t have to be like this. Doctors are required to demonstrate not just consent, but informed consent, from patients: the latter have to understand what they are agreeing to, or the agreement is moot. After years of mis-selling scandals, the same principle is slowly making its way to the financial industry. Logging in to check an ISA, you may be confronted with a 12-point questionnaire designed to check you understand the risks and are happy for the investment to continue.","Yet online, the biggest companies in the world base their businesses around users hitting “I agree” on a dialogue box on a website once, a decade ago, and then never being told what their agreement entails, nor being offered any way to retract their consent and take back control of the information they gave up.","Change is coming. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR – overhauls a continent’s worth of rules around a clear principle that the only person who can ever own an individual’s data is that individual. Olejnik describes the law as a “good starter”, but notes that even it will still need to be “reviewed and updated on a regular basis”.","Stallman wants to go one step further. “I recommend a law prohibiting any system that collects data,” he says, “no matter who runs it, whether it’s a company, some non-profit organisation, or a public agency, whatever, that they are not allowed to collect data unless they can justify it as absolutely necessary for the function to be done.”","It would be a huge step, and one that is unlikely to come without a radical change in how the public views mass data collection. But he has hope, and rejects the label of a Cassandra, doomed with accurate predictions that will always be ignored.","“I don’t know the future, because the future depends on you, so I’m going to try my damn best,” he says. “I’m a pessimist by nature. But just because things look dim, is no reason to give up. And that’s what I’ve been saying for many, many years.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Living in Australia I have no knowledge of all of the political constitutions and laws that govern individual countries.","I attempted to interpret many visions about the United States election seeing a large amount of votes moving away from Trump becoming President of the United States of America. At no stage did I see the Electoral College interference.","Surprisingly when seeking guidance from the higher angelic realms about the prediction interpretation, they do not legitimize a Trump presidency because of the deceptive methods with which he got into public office. I was spiritually guided the night Trump was voted in by the Electoral College that he did not (actually) win the election.","Therefore I will accept the higher realms channeling that Trump is spiritually an illegitimate President and Commander-in-Chief of the Free World. There is more spiritual channeling I will provide to support why the higher realms do not acknowledge Trump as a legitimate elected President.","Spiritually, my higher guardians are channeling that the people of our world are being distracted by those in power who hold court over our everyday lives.

Notice the spiritual channeling \"cloak holders are not there for our resolve.\" The translation \"deceptive in their masks\" can be further understood when you understand the spiritual deceivers interpretation my higher guardians refer to about people who congregate in secret to plan attacks in politics and business.","When I share some of the visions and guidance I received about the secret society's motives, you will be horrified how they set out to create a subservient society (economic slaves).

How do we stop the negative influences of electronic devices? By tackling them head on I'm guided.","Spirit is referring to my channeling facilitation \"as the mirror\" looking into consciousness and pulling back the Akashic knowledge and channeling for you to find and research. If I alter your perception by revealing the visions and prophecy guided, you can check the accuracy. This is what my spiritual guardians refer to as \"removing the shadow from your eyes\".","Before I conclude the translation of the 2017 spiritual channeling prophecy, I would like to thank my loyal Australian and global prediction followers for all of your help sending emails to verify predictions. You have been my rock for the last ten years, after I was spiritually requested to share prophecy.","Thank you for realizing that celebrity psychic predictions are not a legitimate spiritual art.

You see all these psychics taking credit for predicting Trump election results, but somehow their guides failed to enlighten them about how Trump would be an illegitimate POTUS.","The only global spiritual prophecy warning the world about Trump using dirty tactics to game the votes, was from spiritual seer Vine. If you research the spiritual transcripts over the years concerning Vine's warning about Putin holding secret meetings, you can follow how the deceiver elite planned and infiltrated Brexit Leave, and the United States election. Now nearly everything Vine warned about with social media infiltration is coming true.","Here's the latest breakdown of what Vine predicted and what what investigative journalists are now reporting:","Prediction UPDATE:6th October 2017","Joining the Dots...","Gizmodo Article Leads to Trump Election","What does an article in a sensationalist online magazine have to do with the United States-Trump-Russia Deception?","The higher realms have channeled that a sensationalist online article published in Gizmodo (Gawker Media) in May 2016, was treated as a serious report and led to Facebook & Twitter being weaponised for micro-targeted Russian advertisements and fake news, before the Presidential elections.","Gizmodo Article with Unsubstantiated Facebook Criticism","Six months before the 2016 US Elections, an article critical of Facebook appeared in a sensationalist online Gawker Media magazine, Gizmodo.","The Gizmodo article quoting an anonymous source, and alleged that Facebook workers routinely suppressed conservative news from its trending news section. There was no proof given for the allegations. In fact, the anonymous accusations and lack of proof in the article, made it exactly the sort of sensationalist tabloid journalism that Gizmodo was regularly sued for.","Puzzling Over-The-Top Reaction to the Article","Instead of the Gizmodo article being ignored or Facebook suing them, the opposite happened…","Conservative forces used the unfounded and unproven accusations in the article to put public pressure on Facebook to move to the right, and amazingly, Facebook acted as if the story was true and acquiesced.","Brietbart and Peter Smith Tweet about the Article","The story was immediately picked up and magnified by conservative online sites like National Review Online and Brietbart, and astoundingly, it was also Tweeted by Peter Smith, the Republican donor who worked with Russian hackers to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails, and then reportedly committed suicide.","Smith rarely ever used his Twitter account but for some reason, he thought that an obscure article attacking Facebook was important enough to tweet about. The Tweet was then retweeted by fake accounts and Trump bots.","Senator John Thune Uses the Gizmodo Article to Put Pressure on Facebook","If all of this wasn’t strange enough, within hours of the article’s publication, Republican senator John Thune was using it to put pressure on Facebook to increase its conservative coverage.","The lightning speed of Senator Thune's detailed response to the Gizmodo article suggests that he had prior knowledge and was ready to pounce. On the same day the article was published, Republicans released a comprehensive press release seeking answers from Facebook on what they called, \"political manipulation allegations\" raised in the article.","Facebook Acquiesces to Republican Demands","There was no reason for Facebook to take a Republican senator's perceived ideas about bias on Social Media seriously, but amazingly, they did. Facebook rolled over and acquiesced to Republican demands to make Facebook more conservative and arguably biased in favour of Conservative ideals.","They sacked their staff who were responsible for keeping fake news off Facebook and replaced them with an algorithm that let fake news run amok on Facebook before the US elections, ultimately leading to the election of Donald Trump.","Why Did Facebook Make Changes That Allowed Fake News?","The article explains that Facebook’s algorithm is determined by data and is based on what users want. Therefore the algorithm is designed to get users increasingly addicted to Facebook and over the last 12 months fake news has proven to be very addictive.","Was the Gizmodo Story a Set-Up?","So this question remains: Was the Gizmodo story a set-up, designed to give Facebook the excuse to install an algorithm that would allow micro-targeting of fake news to people likely to vote for Trump?","Peter Thiel - Chess Master","At the time of the Facebook article, Gizmodo was owned by Gawker Media, which was being sued by Hulk Hogan. The Hulk Hogan lawsuit was being financially backed by billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel who was on the board of Facebook and one of the original Facebook financial backers.","There was an ongoing war between Gawker Media CEO Nick Denton and Peter Thiel who had earlier been outed as gay by Gawker media. Denton thought that Peter Theil was taking his \"Count of Monte Cristo\" revenge, by suing Gawker into bankruptcy.","It was under these circumstances that Nick Denton made his chess-like move and published the Facebook story alleging political manipulation, which was supplied to him by an anonymous ex-Facebook worker.","However, in the words of chess grandmaster Danny King, \"You can’t take your moves back. Once you play your move you could be stepping into some horrible trap.\"","Checkmate","Within hours of the story being published, conservative forces had sprung a trap that ultimately led to fake news flourishing on Facebook. It led to the removal of hands-on journalists screening fake news and thus forcing data-mined hacked information onto selected key States, and the rest we know. Checkmate…. the election of Trump.","Bannon, Breitbart and Facebook","At the same time as conservative forces were using the fake Gizmodo news story to increase fake news on Facebook, Steve Bannon was reportedly attempting to infiltrate Facebook with Breitbart agents.","As all of this was happening just before Facebook, Google and Twitter staff began working directly with the Trump election campaign team. So, did Steve Bannon also successfully infiltrate Twitter staff?","It is obvious to many social media users that both Facebook and Twitter changed their algorithms before the US elections.","Facebook and Twitter Foreign Business Partnerships - Was the Software Secure?","But what hasn’t been thoroughly covered is the direct partnerships Twitter and Facebook have with foreign companies and whether the software had any vulnerabilities to allow penetration.\nThe more we join the dots, the more obvious it becomes that Vine’s original spiritual prophecy warning before the United States election about deceptive computer activity has been found to be true.","Disclaimer - Vine's Psychic Predictions are spiritually channeled at the request of the higher realms to help humankind.

There is now verifiable evidence that Facebook allowed Russian Infiltrators to set up fake accounts to influence and interfere with the 2016 United States election - exactly as Vine's higher realms 'joining the dots'\nprediction updates indicated.","The case for proving \"collusion\" between Russia and Facebook becomes more likely after the Mueller FBI investigation team forced Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg to release information about Russian advertising on Facebook before the US elections.","Mueller's team served a criminal warrant on Facebook to demand this information even after Zuckerberg denied Facebook was responsible.\nThe warrant also forced Facebook to admit they have suspended 470 fake Russian Facebook profiles involved\nin the Presidential elections.","Vine's spiritual guardians didn't only warn about the deceiver elite gaming\nthe election, we were also guided how they actually used social media for propaganda dissemination months before Brexit and the 2016 United States election. This is why the higher realms have always guided\nthat Trump is an illegitimate President of the United States. The direct relationship between Cambridge Analytica and the Trump marketing team now can't be denied.","Facebook, Google & Twitter Staff Employed to Help Trump","We know that Facebook sacked journalistic staff who\nwere responsible for finding and\ndeleting fake news, and replaced them with a computer algorithm that allowed fake news to run amok on Facebook user news feeds.","A pressing question remaining about Vine's Trump Russia prophecy is,\ndid Zuckerberg or the Facebook board members remove those journalists\nbecause Facebook had entered into a paid relationship worth millions of\ndollars with the Trump administrative marketing team?\nWas there a direct conflict of interest?","According to a recent BBC news story,\nthere were close relationships between the Trump marketing team (Brad Pascale), Cambridge Analytica\nand staff hired from Facebook, Twitter and Google. They were all working together in the same offices on the campaign to elect Donald Trump.","This is what is known about Facebook's direct relationship with\nthe US\nPresidential election:","FACT: Facebook metadata was accessed (or hacked) to send false information to millions of voters who had Facebook accounts, to\ninfluence their decision about who to vote for before the United States Presidential election.","FACT: the removal of the journalists allowed the paid fake news\npro-Trump and anti-Clinton advertising propaganda to be sent to\nselected demographics to get them to immediately think the information was accurate.","FACT:Facebook, Google and YouTube staff worked in the same office as the Cambridge Analytica Trump marketing team.\nAccording to a BBC story, the Facebook staff were, \"kind of hands on partners, as far as being able to utilise the platform as\neffectively as possible.\" The Trump campaign spent most of its budget ($85m) on Facebook, and Facebook\n\"made sure their needs were being met\". Therefore","Theresa Wong, who worked on the Trump campaign's digital operation\nwith Cambridge Analytica said, \"Without Facebook, we wouldn't have won\"","Prediction UPDATE:3rd August 2017","Look Over There!","In this prediction, Vine's higher guardians warn that we will be distracted with \"look over there tactics\" from those in power, \"to distract our attention away from what's really going on.\"","These events dramatically stole the headlines away from one of the \"most important\" Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Russian involvement in the 2016 Elections.","Trump made his transgender tweets on the same day that Bill Browder was scheduled to testify to the Senate Judiciary about what he described as the kleptocratic government and business world of Putin's Russia. Bowder eventually testified about why the Magnitsky Act was talked about in the meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, and why it was crucial to Russian involvement in the US elections.","However, Browder's Senate hearing was postponed to the next day, the same day that Scaramucci called the New Yorker to make his \"profane tirade\".","Vine predicted that these 'look over there' tactics would be employed and warned us not to be distracted by them:\n\"If we fail to see what is being done behind the scenes by being distracted by 'look over there tactics' we are solely responsible for any future predicaments we find ourselves in.\"","Prediction UPDATE:22nd July 2017","Dark Web Site, AlphaBay Shut Down","In this prediction, Spirit guided that we can remove the negative presence of the dark web if we become involved and tackle them head on. This is exactly what police have done in a world wide joint operation to shut down the dark website, AlphaBay.","Until it was closed down, AlphaBay was the biggest illegal buying and selling site on the dark web and the most popular online black market website for illegal drugs, guns, credit cards, stolen data, etc.","Dutch authorities also took control of another dark web buying and selling site, called Hansa. When AlphaBay was shut down, many of their users registered with Hansa instead.

Vine received guidance that the Higher Angelic Realms do not legitimize the Trump presidency because of the deceptive methods used to get him into public office.","In the previous update for this prediction, we talked about those deceptive methods and established how Facebook algorithms were changed before the US elections. The changes allowed fake news from Russian and dark web sources to run rampant on Facebook after being micro-targeted to selected Facebook users.","We also noted that Russian and dark web Trump bots had flooded Twitter, creating fake news, fake trends and attacking anyone who was anti-Trump.","Now, the digital media director for Trump's election campaign Brad Parscale, who worked closely with Jared Kushner during the campaign, has admitted that staff from Twitter, Facebook and Google actually worked for the Trump campaign!","In response to the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, Brad Parscale released a statement saying, \"The only collaboration I am aware of in the Trump digital campaign was with staff provided to the campaign by Facebook, Google and Twitter....

Brad Parscale's admission that staff from Facebook, Twitter and Google worked on the Trump Campaign, poses serious questions including:","Did any of the \"inside information\" required by the Russians, come from Facebook, Twitter and Google staff who were also working for the Trump digital campaign?","Brad Parscale is soon to appear before the House Intel Committee. Will he be asked about the Facebook, Google and Twitter staff who he says worked on the Trump campaign, and their role in Russian collusion in the election of Donald Trump?","This is what we Know about Facebook and Twitter Involvement in the Trump Campaign","Fake News from Russia and the Dark Web was micro-targeted to American voters by companies like Cambridge Analytica and Giles-Parscale, played a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump.","Before the election, GOP pressured Facebook to remove staff who were responsible for keeping fake news in check.","The Trump Digital campaign team spends up to $90 million on Facebook and Twitter advertising, including a six figure sum ($100,000+) to purchase the promoted hashtag, #TextTrump88022 just before the Republican Convention.

How involved were they with setting up Facebook to allow so much fake news from Russia and the dark web?","Did they infiltrate the Twitter Network and alter the algorithms to favour the huge number of Trump bots and trolls? Were they also preventing Twitter trends that opposed Trump and were they stopping anti-Trump Tweets from being found before the election?","Just as Vine predicted, day by day, the deceptive methods used by the deceivers to elect Trump, are being exposed.","UPDATE:19th June 2017","In this prediction about the election of Donald Trump, Vine said, \"Now we begin to know what has been hidden......\"","Why the Higher Realms Warned the World, \"All Is Not What It Seems\" - Elite Weaponizing Data Using Social Media Algorithms","As far back as 2013, in Vine's psychic prediction about The Controllers of the Internet, the higher realms warned that the elite were weaponizing data by changing algorithms on the world wide web. In that prediction, Vine's spiritual Guardians also refer to the Keys of the Internet being under threat.","Vine was also spiritually guided that widespread computer deception was taking place before the United States election and this had also happened with the United Kingdom Brexit vote.","By looking at Vine's comprehensive predictions between 2011 and 2017 and examining the clues left by Vine's Spiritual Guardians, we have been guided how to join the dots. What is the direct link between Facebook Algorithms, Fake News and Russian Interference in US Elections that resulted in the election of Donald Trump?","We discovered that the timing of events was crucial to the deceivers pulling off their unprecedented attack on democracy, by disseminating and microtargeting their fake news stories on Facebook and Twitter.","Now we can unveil the chain of events that made it possible for the deceivers to employ their fake news stories on Facebook.","Fake News on Facebook","Although fake news stories existed on Facebook before 2016, they were kept in check by a team of (real life human) journalists employed by Facebook in early 2014.","The team was called \"The Trending Topics\" or \"Trending News\" team and part of their job was to filter out extreme fake news stories. These could be either right or left wing fake news stories that the Facebook news algorithm pushed onto Facebook users.","The screening of fake news ended when the real life journalists were sacked. It is important to see the span of control the deceivers had to pull off their master-plan.","Pressure on Facebook to put more Conservative Stories into their News Feeds","During May 2016, 1 month before the Brexit referendum and 6 months before the US elections, Republicans began putting pressure onto Facebook to move away from their efforts to be politically neutral, and into becoming politically conservative and allowing political extremes to take hold on Facebook.","Here is the timeline of events of how the elite deceivers came to be able to manipulate and disseminate fake news on Facebook that was previously kept in check by a team of Facebook journalists:","Facebook Algorithm and Fake News TIMELINE:","MAY 4th 2016","Gizmodo Article Attacks Facebook \"Trending Topics\" Team","Gizmodo is a science and technology review website that also writes articles on politics. Its owner, Gawker Media was often sued for defamation and copyright issues, which eventually sent them into receivership. On May 4th 2016, Gizmodo published an article, which revealed that Facebook's trending news algorithm was overseen by real journalists, (the Trending Topics Team).","These journalists were empowered to weed out hoax news stories. The Gizmodo story inferred that the \"Trending Topics\" team was run by social elites: \"people in their 20s and early 30s, most of whom graduated from Ivy League and private East Coast schools.\"","Most of the article was devoted to alleged criticisms of the team's working conditions. Therefore the allegation in this story was that 'social elites' from Ivy league schools may be choosing which news stories appeared in Facebook feeds. There was no mention of political bias.","MAY 9-10th 2016","A Second Gizmodo Article on the Facebook \"Trending Topics\" Team","Whereas the May 4th article in Gizmodo did not allege any political bias, a second article 6 days later alleged that Facebook workers routinely suppressed conservative news from the trending news section. The source for the Facebook allegations was, \"Anonymous\" and no proof of the accusations was ever given.","MAY 10th 2016","Facebook Trending Topics Team Leader Refutes Allegations","Trending Topics team leader Tom Stocky, refuted the allegations published in Gizmodo.\nOn Facebook, Tom Stocky said that he had, \"found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true\". Tom Stocky went on to explain how the Trending Topics team worked.","He wrote: \"Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.\" …. \"… reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources…\"","Facebook \"Trending Topics\" team leader Tom stocky, wrote this on May 10 2016. Today we refer to the \"hoaxes\" he refers to as, 'Fake News'.","MAY 10th 2016","Republican Senator Thune Announces Senate Investigation into Facebook","Just a few hours after the publication of the Gizmodo article that alleged Facebook \"suppression of conservative news\", Republican Senator John Thune released a detailed press release seeking answers from Facebook on what he called, \"political manipulation allegations\" raised in the article.","The lightning fast response from the Republican senator raises legitimate concerns about how much he knew about the article before it was published. The initial response took the form of a 3 page letter containing a series of questions to Facebook. The questions were supposedly gleaned from the Gizmodo article that was just a few hours old.","Even if the allegations were true, Facebook wasn't breaking any laws and was under no obligation to acquiesce to a Republican senator's perceived ideas about bias on Social Media.","However, we are asked to believe that Senator Thune immediately dropped everything he was working on, to address his attention to a spurious non-mainstream article in a science and technology review website that had already been sued for defamation for other stories it had published. At the time of Senator Thune's Facebook press release, the owners of Gizmodo, Gawker Media, were just about to lose a $135 million defamation case against them, which sent them into receivership a short time later.","AUGUST 26th, 4 PM","Facebook Sacks it's Journalists","3 months after Facebook was first put under Republican pressure, Facebook sacked it's entire Trending News Team and replaced them with an algorithm.\nThe team was asked to leave the office by 5 pm that day, and from that time on, an algorithm took complete control and allowed fake news to flood the Facebook news feed before the 2016 US Elections.","And so it happened that the Republicans used an arguably 'fake news' story published by a suspect media site, to put pressure on Facebook to sack the journalists responsible for stemming the flow of fake news on Facebook.","AUGUST - SEPTEMBER 2016","Republicans Refuse to Back President Obama's proposed Bi-Partisan Efforts to Stop Russian Interference","At the end of August, the CIA warned Democrats and Republicans that Russia was working to elect Donald Trump and to disrupt America’s political system and undermine the electoral process. President Obama was reluctant to be seen as using the intelligence for solely Democratic ends, and so he sort bipartisan agreement from the Republicans before counteracting the Russian interference.","However, the Republicans made it clear they weren't interested in doing much about the Russian interference, which was favouring them. When the Obama administration proposed a letter to state election officials warning them of the possible threat posed by Russian hacking, GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans would only agree to a toned-down version of the letter which did not mention the Russians.","Australia's Four Corners Report on Facebook Algorithms","In April 2017, a Four Corners report called Cracking the Code raised concerns about the Facebook Algorithms and confirmed that when the Facebook team of Journalists were sacked and the algorithm took over, \"fake news really took off\".","Four Corners interviewed Dale Schrader, one of the sacked Facebook 'Trending News' journalists. Schrader said, \"After the Trending News Team was let go, there was a big problem with the sensational, or factually incorrect or misleading news sources and trending topics. It was just a disaster.\"","Four Corners report on Facebook Algorithms - \"Cracking the Code\"","In reality, even the Facebook news algorithm is susceptible to human bias, depending on how it is programmed. However, it's much harder to pin the blame on the people responsible for what an algorithm does, and to sack them.","Why is the Republican Senators' questioning of Facebook before the US Elections Suspicious?","It was just a few hours after allegations about Facebook from an anonymous source in a non-mainstream website Gizmodo, that republican Senator John Thune requested Facebook to brief the US Senate Commerce Committee about the allegations.","3 months later, the whole journalist section was sacked even though Facebook journalists said the grounds of the allegations were false. They were the only human faces screening fake news from non-credible media and stopping users from being bombarded with extreme political propaganda.\nVine was spiritually guided about the algorithm changes and how the deceivers were able to weaponise social media in her Controllers of the Internet psychic prediction.","Was there an insider in Facebook directly connected to the Republicans or Russia?","It is no secret that billionaire Peter Thiel, who is on the Facebook Board and was one of the original Facebook Investors, is also a strong supporter of Donald Trump. Theil owns Palantir Technologies, which specializes in big data analysis, and he has direct knowledge of the type of data mining techniques used by Cambridge Analytica and it's parent company SCL, when they used Facebook data to help Trump win the US elections.","It is also interesting to note a connection between Peter Theil and the website that published the allegations about the Facebook Trending Topics team. At the same time that Gizmodo decided to publish the negative Facebook articles that ultimately led to the election of Donald Trump, Gizmodo's parent company Gawker Media, was being sued for over $100 million by Hulk Hogan.","Did Peter Theil, or any other members of the Facebook board apply pressure to Mark Zuckerberg to remove the journalists and allow fake news to flood Facebook before the US elections?","Vine was previously warned that the owners of social media were compiling data on all their users. Now we can see how the metadata on Facebook was crucial to being able to reach voters before the November election, and influence them with fake news.","In Vine's \"All Will Be Revealed\" Channeling, the higher realms warned that deceivers were using the keys and metadata to brainwash their audience. Now we can see how they did it, but there are several unanswered questions about who was directly involved in the United States.","Who Is On the Facebook Board and Who Are The Influencers?","Peter Thiel was clearly educated in big data analysis, so why didn't he warn the Facebook board about the possibility of Facebook being abused for its metadata?","Why didn't Peter Thiel warn the Facebook board that removing their journalists and relying solely on unproven algorithms would result in the possible exploitation of the Facebook advertising system before the United States election? Surely Facebook was equipped to defend its data from alien attacks and had contingency plans set in motion?","Something is amiss..","Did Republican Senators and Conservative Organizations have Prior Knowledge of Russian Hacking and Plans to Use Facebook Metadata?","Why did the Republican Party members interfere in the way Facebook was screening news stories? After being warned by the CIA that Russia was hacking the electoral systems, why didn't the Republican party, especially Senator Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan etc. work with President Obama to do something about it? Why did they wish to keep the Russian hacking into the electoral process a secret, when President Obama wanted a bipartisan attempt to warn electoral officials and stop the hacking?","Why was the Republican Party so confident that Russia would not interfere in their own electoral campaign?","Something doesn't add up...","Getting to the Truth of Who Knew What","Clearly we're now in unchartered deceiver waters. It's obvious the chain of events leads us to the Facebook algorithms, and we can't rule out similar interference with the Twitter algorithms.","Did Twitter get bombarded with fake news, polls and bots during the preselection and United States election? Absolutely. Yes. It did.","Twitter was widely abused by the same perpetrators of fake news on Facebook. How did that come about? Like Facebook, were the Twitter algorithms changed to allow the bots and fake news to take over before the US election?","Did the owners of Facebook and Twitter stand to financially benefit from a Trump Presidency?","So many questions need to be answered concerning why and how the deceivers reached their target audience and artificially persuaded and manipulated voters before Brexit and the United States elections.","Take a moment to reflect on the fake news that manipulated American voters, and how it wouldn't have happened if the Facebook journalists weren't sacked.","Take a moment to reflect how Republican Senators could put pressure on Mark Zuckerberg, simply because anonymous accusations against Facebook were published in a spurious non-mainstream web article.","Consider how Facebook was the direct source for data mining used by Cambridge Analytica and how paid Facebook advertising was sent to the American public from Wikileaks and propped up by fake conservative social media profiles.","There is no such thing as coincidence in the angelic realms, everything channeled to Vine about how the elite manipulate elections, was to help us get to the truth.

Did US billionaire Robert Mercer explicitly influence the outcome of the referendum and undermine the UK electoral system?","Under the shadow of this Brexit controversy, Theresa May, having just signed Article 50 to begin Brexit negotiations with the EU, has called a snap election three years before it was due!","Why has a Snap UK Election been Called?","Is it a coincidence that the Tories have called the snap election just days before the Electoral Commission investigation into Brexit Leave spending was announced?","30 Conservative Party MPs may be Proscecuted","The snap election was also called just days before it was announced that 30 Conservative MPs may be prosecuted over Battle Bus spending in the last UK election.

That's worrying enough on it's own, but they also plan to simultaneously introduce severe austerity measures for 100,000's of people who may well find that joining the military is the only way they can feed their families. Vine's spiritual guardians warn that the deceivers behind the Trump administration are setting out to create \"a subservient society of economic slaves\".","Spiritually, there is no such thing as coincidence.\nEverything is connected and when the connection is as immediate and obvious as a federal budget designed to increase the possibility of war, whilst simultaneously creating a 'cannon fodder' class of \"economic slaves\", it's time to sound the alarm bells.","Dangerous Budget Cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)","If there is one thing that Vine's Spiritual Guardians have made perfectly clear for many years, it is that climate change is real, we are causing it and we need to halt it NOW.","The spiritual deceivers behind Donald Trump have put a climate change denier in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and now they have proposed to cut EPA funding by 31%. Roughly 3,200 EPA employees will lose their jobs and climate change will be allowed to run rampant.","Spiritually, Vine has already warned about the psychic abuse of our natural laws and that there are dark lower entities behind the deceivers who are denying climate change and prolonging the burning of fossil fuels.","Remember Vine's warning in this prediction: \"It is up to the people of the world to be alert and ready to tackle any breakdown of government office that will tear at the very fabric of harmonious society.\"","Is there really Support for Veterans?","Vine also predicted that the Trump Government would not support veterans.","Although there has been a proposed increase for Veterans Affairs in the Trump budget, most of the increase is earmarked for military hospitals. This would make sense if the Trump administration is making plans to go to war.","Providing money for military hospitals does not equate to the general support for Veterans that Vine warns is in peril. The planned sweeping austerity measures will directly effect thousands of veterans who rely on Government help. For instance, according to this militarytimes.com article, Trump's proposed cuts to Meals on Wheels would adversly affect 500,000 veterans who rely on those meals. And thousands of veterans may be made homeless if rental vouchers are cut.","In light of the harsh austerity measures planned by the Trump administration, the small amount set aside for general support of Veterans, is unlikely to be sufficient and falls short of what veterans organizations requested. In their Independent Budget, Veterans have called for an $88.9 billion increase to Veterans Affairs. The proposed budget gives only $4 Billion.","Vine's prediction that the Trump administration would not support veterans, looks like it's coming true.","Vine Warns of Distraction Tactics","In this prediction Vine wrote, \"The cloak holders, as my spiritual guardians refer to the elite, will do whatever it takes to draw our attention away from political policy.","Vine predicted that the Trump administration would try to distract from what they are really trying to do. This is coming true on a daily basis, with Trump himself being the biggest distraction from policies that will tear down democracy and create a class of economic slaves for the elite deceivers.","If we fail to see what is being done behind the scenes by being distracted by 'look over there tactics' we are solely responsible for any future predictaments we find ourselves in.\"","Vine's spiritual guardians warn the people of the world to be alert and ready to tackle any breakdown of government office that will tear at the very fabric of harmonious society...\"","UPDATE:1st February 2017","In this channeling Spirit said, \"Open your eyes to see past the detractors who parade their wares...\"","Vine explained that, \"The parading of the wares\" is about advertising and marketing used by companies owned by spiritual deceivers, ...set up solely to distract our attention away from what's really going on.\"","Companies and Deceivers Behind Trump","Some of the (marketing) companies and deceivers that Spirit warns to \"Open your eyes to see\" are now becoming apparent for all to see.","When Donald Trump received the Republican nomination for the 2016 US Elections, his ideas were well known, but Trump's campaign for the Presidency was lacking funds and organisation.","Enter billionaire Robert Mercer...","Robert Mercer","Robert Mercer is a computer scientist, billionaire businessman and the #1 donor to federal candidates (all of them conservative) in the 2016 US elections.

(It also fails to learn that it has failed to control it.)","The rest is noise, as far as I’m concerned. Even if anyone really believes that sharing data about users is not the Facebook business model, who cares what its business model is? Whatever plausible sounding business model it had before didn’t protect anyone, and didn’t stop these characters from collecting and using data in all sorts of shady ways.","Of course there’s the strong possibility that Cambridge Analytica and others misused the data, didn’t delete it as promised, performed unsanctioned analyses on it. Oh no! Who would have thought someone would do that? The real question was what was Facebook expecting when it handed out data on millions essentially on the honor system?","Facebook’s business model is monetizing your data (the data you give it, it must be said), one way or the other.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Here's the wild story of how she convinced thousands to believe her dangerous science, and how a grassroots movement shut her down when Facebook wouldn't.","When Bruce Wilmot decided to go on “Jilly Juice” last summer, he’d just learned that his pancreatic cancer was back, and it was bad. He’d been through the hell of chemo before, and the last thing he wanted was more treatment.","“My dad was really desperate,” Taylor Wilmot, his daughter, told BuzzFeed News. “He was very sad, and he didn’t want to die.”","Then 55 and living alone in Columbus, Georgia, he stumbled across the Facebook group of Jillian Mai Thi Epperly, a woman from Canton, Ohio, whose tens of thousands of followers swore by her bizarre, dangerous, and entirely made-up science theory: that all diseases — including cancer — are caused by a fungus called candida that lives in the gut.","Jamie Jansen","Jillian Mai Thi Epperly","As Epperly claimed on the group — called Exposing the Lies Candida: Weaponized Fungus Mainstreaming Mutancy — candida attracts parasites, and the only way to health is a severely restricted diet accompanied by large quantities of her signature fermented cabbage juice. Her potion was a purgative, and she said that “healing symptoms” included nausea, headaches, dizziness, and explosive blasts of diarrhea. These “waterfalls” supposedly brought out the parasites, which were visible in the toilet bowl.","For Wilmot, things moved swiftly downhill after his diagnosis. The doctor had given him a few weeks, maybe a few months, according to his rabbi, Brian Hawkins, who told BuzzFeed News he was with Wilmot when he was diagnosed. But within just days, Wilmot found it hard to get around, and a hospice facility sent a bed to his duplex.","“I've been juicing like crazy, Cancer bad juice good,” he wrote in a Facebook post on June 13. “Ime [sic] brewing up some of Jillian Mai Thi's protocol and plan on switching completely over to her diet, ferment etc. as soon as that is ready.” Friends wrote comments of encouragement and said they were praying for him.","Epperly, whom Wilmot had tagged, also replied: “You are amazing If you need a short chat later let me know You will pull through.”","“I might take you up on that,” Wilmot said.","A few days later, friends visited his condo to help make a huge batch of the juice. They followed the recipe described in documents posted on Epperly’s Facebook group: Add a tablespoon of pink Himalayan salt to two cups of water and two cups of cabbage or kale. Puree in a blender, pour into a glass jar, cover, and leave at room temperature to ferment for three days. Drink a few cups nightly — up to a gallon a day.","Rabbi Hawkins, who had become Wilmot's religious guide and friend in those final months, remembered hearing about the cabbage juice. \"If someone had bottled up rat poison and told him, ‘It will heal you,’ he would have drunk it,” Hawkins told BuzzFeed News. “That’s how desperate the man was.”","When Taylor came back to visit her father a few weeks later, she was shocked. “He was totally emaciated,” she said. “He was drinking so much of it, he was basically starving himself. It was all coming out as diarrhea.”","In mid-July, Wilmot's friends found him unconscious on the floor of his apartment, and he was moved to a hospice facility. On July 20, about a month after he was diagnosed and began the juice purge, he died.","Facebook is under scrutiny for its outsized role in spreading political misinformation. But it’s also a platform where pseudoscience, snake oil remedies, and medical falsehoods multiply unchecked. Those have received far less attention, despite carrying the potential for immediate physical harm.","There are countless fake science gurus with large Facebook followings. But Epperly’s is particularly striking, according to Tim Caulfield, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Alberta, because she’s not a celebrity. “She isn’t associated with some well-packaged brand, so it’s interesting that she’s able to accumulate this much interest.”","She says her cabbage concoction will reverse illness, arrest aging, and even turn gay people straight.","Epperly is also notable for the stark absurdity of her theory. She says her cabbage concoction will reverse all forms of illness, arrest aging, and even turn gay people straight. These claims are “absolutely dangerous nonsense,” David Seres, director of medical nutrition at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center, told BuzzFeed News. “I am almost speechless.”","Epperly has no background in medicine or science. She delivers elements of her theory in rambling videos beamed live from her home. They have an unvarnished reality-TV quality to them: Epperly is often in a T-shirt, hair up, walking through the house as she talks. She is also a prolific Facebook commenter, each missive a stream-of-consciousness word salad. And for $70 an hour, she told BuzzFeed News, she will provide personal phone consultations, talking people through her theory and how to make the recipe.","When asked why she presents wild theories with no evidence to back them up, Epperly likened her efforts to a religious conversion. She doesn’t worry, she said, about people who don’t believe.","“We’re using a different context in my world, and the manifestations from the salt and the accessing of the nutrients is gonna give you a different context of what the symptoms are,” Epperly said. “So essentially what it is, is we’re trying to turn an atheist into a Christian.”","More than a dozen people told BuzzFeed News that they complained to Facebook about Epperly and her group, to no avail. The company has fairly lax rules for dealing with pseudoscientific groups. “We remove content, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety,” according to its community standards.","For example, in January the platform removed videos promoting the Tide Pod Challenge after people began posting videos eating (or pretending to eat) laundry detergent.","But Epperly’s group did not violate Facebook’s rules, a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, and so was not taken down. The company wants to encourage discussion among its users, the spokesperson added, and does not want to censor provocative ideas. Facebook refused to discuss Wilmot’s death with BuzzFeed News on the record.","Sometimes, perhaps most of the time, Facebook’s relaxed policy means that people making wild health claims — like Joseph Mercola, “Food Babe” Vani Hari, or the makers of the “FasciaBlaster” who injured women with a device that promised to zap cellulite — can thrive. But in Epperly’s case, something unusual happened: Some Facebook users decided to take matters into their own hands.","Motivated in part by Wilmot's death, about a dozen private satellite Facebook groups — the biggest has over 10,000 members — have emerged with the explicit purpose of taking her down. This countermovement has organized to contact journalists, law enforcement, and the Ohio Medical Board about Epperly’s dangerous ideas — and prompted a response from the Ohio Attorney General.","But whether their efforts will make any dent in Epperly’s business — or change Facebook’s stance on enabling fake science — is still very much an open question.","Via JenLeigh5 / Photobucket","Screenshots from Epperly's Facebook group, as collected by her critics.","Epperly lays out her personal history in a 106-page book she self-published on Google Drive. She was born in Vietnam, arrived in the US before she turned 2, and was adopted by American parents.","Growing up in the Bay Area, her father worked in biotech, and she points to this as the source of her insider knowledge that the pharmaceutical industry is a scam. She is against vaccines, and presents an argument that’s common among anti-vaxxers: that Big Pharma is in cahoots with doctors to keep Americans sick and addicted to medication. “I realized that vaccines are just one way to inject pollution into a human body,” she wrote.","After bouncing around for college — Epperly told BuzzFeed News she did not graduate — she helped sell insurance. She developed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Because it kept her away from work once a month, she said, she had a hard time holding down a job.","She met her husband online, then moved to Ohio to live with him. In their first years together he worked as a trucker and she would travel cross-country with him, listening to radio pundits and conspiracy theorists, like InfoWars founder Alex Jones.","“I was exposed to the anti-vaxx community, the chemtrail community,” Epperly said. Looking for alternate ways to treat her PMDD, she said, “I tried every single detox, pill, powder, supplement, that I had access to, and joined millions of groups that were all promoting their wares.”","She also dabbled in fermentation, trying recipes for kombucha and for pickles. At some point, she decided to swap cucumbers for cabbage, and upped the spoons of salt in the brew. That was the genesis for her theory.","In parallel, Epperly said, she was researching various diseases online, and noticed that candida or other fungi were “always a factor.” Some alternative medicine websites claim (falsely) that yeast in the human gut can bloom and overwhelm the body if it is exposed to the wrong food or chemical. Epperly just amped up that idea, implicating the fungus as the ultimate cause of any and all illness.","Epperly made kale and cabbage versions of her Jilly Juice for the first time in October 2016. By January 2017, she was posting video demos on her personal Facebook page, attracting dozens of comments. She said that her fans convinced her to create a private Facebook group, which quickly grew over the next few months to include thousands of people.","Epperly said that the group was something of a laboratory: She’d watch how “the protocol” affected her followers, and based on their responses, she’d update her ideas. For example, a key aspect of her theory — that the fermented cabbage juice expels parasites that live in the digestive system — only came about after she saw people’s photos of their bowel movements.","“I wasn't aware of parasites in the beginning,” she told BuzzFeed News. “The group actually was a research tool, a database tool, to share what they were passing. And I’m like, Oh my god. That’s coming out of you in waterfalls?”","Many foods — sugars, legumes, grains, anything processed, and all meat except chicken — fed the parasites, she said. Constipation did too. Poop and its passing became a pillar of Epperly’s dictum.","“We are in a poop cult,” she joked in one video, and a post on her Facebook page. “You know why? Because we’re realizing that poop is one of the main things that is feeding the candida and the worms and the parasites.”","As her following grew, her theory stretched from the digestive system to sexual preferences. “Is our society ready to accept that gay lesbian and transgender is a mutation of the human body,” she wrote in one post.","When asked to elaborate on this, Epperly told BuzzFeed News by email: “I've had gay people say that their intention is to reverse her health issues but not change their sexual leanings and that is completely fine and they may find that in the process of reversing their health issues it may change their sexual desires so it's all a possibility.”","She was amazed by what she saw: Members posted photos of their toilet bowls like they were trophies. Commenters earnestly read the blobs and streaks like tea leaves, pointing out what they thought were tapeworms, fungi, and parasites, and congratulating the posters on taking steps toward better health. Every few days, Epperly herself would appear via a livestream from her home.","“I started watching people drinking it, and using it as an enema, and giving it to babies and children.”","Burns’ curiosity quickly turned to anger. “I started watching people drinking it, and using it as an enema, and giving it to babies and children,” she said.","In one video a member had posted, Burns said, a toddler drank a concoction of Epperly’s recipe. “I was just like, ‘Are you serious?’”","Burns looked on Facebook for others who shared her alarm, and found a (now-defunct) group called “Exposing the lies of jillian mai thi & her protocol,” in which people railed against Epperly. Burns kept watching posts in Epperly’s group and began documenting developments regularly.","Aeryale Thomas, a 37-year-old from Grand Rapids, Michigan, founded a similar private group, “Death By Salt: Mainstreaming The Mai Thi Experiment,” last year. She told BuzzFeed News that she was also alarmed that kids were consuming the fermented cabbage juice.","“What caught my eye was a parent putting the protocol, the juice, in a feeding tube of a child that was very sick,” she said. “No one was saying, ‘This is a bad idea.’”","Epperly's opponents marked up a screenshot from her Facebook group allegedly showing the diaper of a baby who had been fed the protocol.","Thomas said she messaged the mother, but the woman blocked her and did not respond. Still, Thomas said she felt she had to warn strangers about buying into Epperly’s fake health claims. “I don’t know these people, but it’s still like watching a child get hit by a car,” Thomas said.","Convinced that poorly fermented products could be making people ill, and that the salt content in the mixture was also bad news, Thomas said that she and several other women began screenshotting posts by Epperly and her followers and posting them in their own group.","“I feel compelled to retain this information just in case something does happen and the authorities need some kind of reference, a reference point,” Thomas told BuzzFeed News.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that she believes that infants can benefit from drinking the juice in addition to breast milk. She added that, “a baby could potentially live on this along with coconut oil and be fine, and would be able to flourish and grow because they’re getting access to nutrients.“ (Epperly also claimed that Thomas is a “proponent” of giving pregnant women kratom, a plant with some opioid properties. Thomas told BuzzFeed News that she is in a Facebook group about kratom, and she believes the plant may be a better alternative to painkillers.)","By the fall of last year, when word got out that Bruce Wilmot had died, Epperly addressed the tragedy in a video she posted on her Facebook page. In the video, she claimed that she had spoken to Wilmot about how and when to drink the juice. The reason things went wrong, she explained, was that he didn’t take enough of it.","“He stopped. I told him, cut back a little bit if the symptoms get too much — but he really shouldn’t have. He really should have kept going,” she said.","In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Epperly doubled down on this idea, saying Wilmot had not been “aggressive” enough in following her protocol, and speculating that his death could have also been helped along by his medications, the pineapple juice he drank, or the medical system.","“Nobody looks for my protocol when they are completely 100% well and happy,” she said.","Wilmot’s daughter Taylor watched the video from her home in California a few months after he died. “That really hurt my heart,” she told BuzzFeed News. She found the video after someone had tried to recruit her into the movement to destroy Epperly’s Facebook stronghold. “I was shocked that there was a whole group of people who believed that my dad had died from this,” she said.","She joined several of the opposition groups and wrote a public post describing her dad’s experience. She hoped that people who were thinking about starting Epperly’s protocol would find her note and change their minds.","News of Wilmot’s death enraged Epperly’s critics. By fall, the handful of anti-Epperly groups had multiplied to almost a dozen. (Burns launched her own “anti-juice” splinter group with this stated goal: “We want to take Jillian off Facebook! At least take the children and babies off of this protocol!” It now has more than 420 members.)","“It’s like spy vs. spy,” she said. “I mean, it’s a war of information.”","But Epperly’s group grew too. Ann Kennedy, a 42-year-old from the Columbus suburbs, told BuzzFeed News she joined the group in late 2017, after she saw a friend post about the protocol.","Kennedy had been a dental assistant for a decade and was outraged by the claims. “It was like, whoa, is this real life?” Once in the group, she realized that thousands of people were convinced it was real.","“I joined every anti-Jillian group I could,” Kennedy said. Almost immediately, she was kicked out of Epperly’s group — evidently, Epperly’s followers had covertly joined the opposition forums and spotted her.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that she knows some of her followers joined anti-juice groups to keep tabs on her critics, but said she didn’t ask or pay them to.","“It’s like spy vs. spy,” she said. “I mean, it’s a war of information.”","Bruce Wilmot / Via Facebook","Wilmot's jars of Jilly Juice.","Over the past few months, the thousands-strong anti-Epperly movement — on Facebook and elsewhere — has taken real-world actions against her.","In October, an anonymous author created a (now-private) blog and posted systematic and lengthy takedowns of Epperly’s claims, including annotated screenshots of Facebook posts. In a YouTube library, someone catalogued snippets of Epperly’s Facebook videos — proof of her claims in case she shut down her account. A Change.org petition (with 809 signatures as of February) called for Epperly to be banned from Facebook and all social media. In the private anti-Epperly group “Cabbotaging Children & Pets: Reporting Jillian Mai Thi Epperly,” a Google document listed contact information for state and federal law enforcement, attorneys general, and medical boards.","Another group pooled their screenshots and saved them on the photo-sharing site Photobucket, organized in folders by theme, archived in case Epperly’s Facebook group disappeared. (The person behind that account told BuzzFeed News that she spent 25 hours over two weeks working on it.) Jeff Holiday, a 35-year-old from Oregon who makes YouTube videos skewering scammy science, produced a three-part series on Epperly, racking up about 47,000 views in total.","Andrew Stewart, a 32-year-old from Minnesota, joined Epperly’s group in November, after hearing about it on an anti-vaxx group he was trolling. Between jobs, living alone, with time on his hands, he drafted a letter to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office in late December, requesting that the office consider criminal charges against Epperly.","“I would like to ask that the office of the Ohio Attorney General without delay investigate this matter and use every legal option to make this woman stop, and furthermore consider criminal charges,” he wrote. “She is an inherent threat to the safety of others and what she is doing is neither legal nor by any standard morally sound at all.”","A few days later, the AG’s office replied to Stewart, referring him to the state medical board. Over the next few weeks, Stewart said, he also contacted the State of Ohio Medical Board, the criminal investigations division at the FDA, and Interpol.","“I didn't want her to go somewhere she could be immune to prosecution,” Stewart told BuzzFeed News.","Kennedy, meanwhile, filed a complaint with the Ohio Medical Board, asserting that Epperly was dispensing medical advice without a license.","She also turned her efforts online. “I googled ‘cults,’” she remembered, looking for ways to take down organized groups led by scam artists. She tried a local news station in Ohio, but they didn’t bite. She stopped short of calling the police. “I just couldn’t imagine calling the police department and saying these things,” she said. “I feared that they would want to come find me and take me away.”","According to Epperly, others have gone to more extreme lengths. She said she has received spoofed phone calls that appeared to originate from the police department, or the humane society, or the Ohio AG’s office.","Someone told Facebook that Epperly’s husband was dead, so the company turned his profile into a memorial page. (It has since been turned back.) Once, she said, wings and pizzas arrived at her house from an anonymous sender who hadn’t paid for them.","For $30 annually, or $5 monthly, readers could become part of Epperly’s “growing virtual community.”","Epperly said she decided to turn her group from public to private for the sake of her moderators, who were also receiving messages from the anti-juice crowd by email and on Facebook.","By the new year, Epperly had had enough of her haters. She put her group on lockdown — no one but moderators could make new posts — and trimmed the membership by about 1,000 members, according to a message she shared with the remaining group.","Epperly explained that she would launch an independent website and host her following there instead of Facebook. She said that the group had become too large, and that her trolls had become too much of a nuisance. “I left the platform because I have people being targeted,“ she told BuzzFeed News. “I've actually had people who were visited by [Child Protective Services] and had to get a note from their doctor to allow them to feed their baby or their child this recipe.”","Jillyjuice.com launched on Feb. 5. Epperly wrote on the homepage: “I have a protocol to reverse 100% all of your health issues from A-Z forever vaccinated or not, except for major organ transplant patients and surrogate mothers until they bring the baby to term!!”","For $30 annually, or $5 monthly, readers could become part of Epperly’s “growing virtual community.” She spent the next couple of weeks explaining to the Facebook group which modes of payment she could and couldn’t take (from credit card and bank transfers to checks mailed to a P.O. box in Canton, Ohio) and posting daily reminders that she would be shutting down the 58,000-member page soon.","Not everyone was happy with the move away from Facebook, but Epperly dismissed them. When group members asked if she would keep her website free, she balked.","“I’m not going to put up with somebody sniveling about how they can’t afford to pay for my site which is only $30 a year which is Pennies on the dollar and believe me if people want to know this information they will find a way to move Heaven and Earth and those who snivel and talk about how poor they are they just need to do the recipe and drink and drink,” she wrote.","Via JenLeigh5 / Photobucket","Screenshots, as collected by Epperly's critics, of \"The List\" of rules for people new to her group.","In mid-February, just as Epperly had promised, the Facebook group vanished. She told BuzzFeed News that she purged the group of almost all its members, but keeps the archives so she can see old posts when she wants to.","The move did not seem to deter the anti-juice movement. The week the Facebook group disappeared, Thomas of Michigan launched her own anti-juice website, and also submitted a complaint to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, noting that “jillyjuice.com is soliciting donations for medical advice,” according to the complaint provided to BuzzFeed News by the attorney general.","This time, instead of dismissing the complaint, the AG’s complaint specialist, Anne Davis, told Thomas and Epperly to talk to each other to try to reach an amicable resolution.","Instead, Epperly wrote an email to Davis claiming she was “a victim of internet bullying no different than dealing with a school yard bully.” She explained that she had set up the website and its paywalled forum to ward off such “evil and malicious” attacks. And she repeated her claim that her protocol could “potentially reverse Cancer, disease and chronic illness using liquefied sauerkraut.”","Thomas, meanwhile, asked Epperly in an email to disavow the “healing” and “reversing” claims that she had made, and in particular to stop recommending that people feed the salty fermented brew to children. “There are many people who have done your Protocol, both long-term, and short-term, and have drunk the 'jillyjuice' — only to have had impairment, negative reactions and irreparable harm,” Thomas wrote.","Epperly’s reply landed in her inbox minutes later: “Fuck off.”","Thomas forwarded the exchange to Davis.","About two weeks later, a representative from the agency told BuzzFeed News that the complaint had been closed — and passed on to the FDA.","“Our Consumer Protection Section reviewed the information but felt that another agency (in this case the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) may be in a better position to address the concerns presented in this complaint,” spokesperson Kate Hanson told BuzzFeed News by email.","Kennedy and Stewart received identical responses to their complaints submitted to the Ohio Medical Board. The board told them that the query had been directed to the AG’s office — the same office that had just relinquished responsibility to the FDA. (Stewart said he still hadn’t heard back from the FDA or Interpol.)","Despite the best efforts of thousands of people who banded together to boot out Epperly’s fake science news, it still thrives, dodging agency regulations and platform policies. No one seems to be able, or inclined, to make Epperly stop.","Facebook said the group doesn’t violate its policies. When asked if the Federal Trade Commission was responsible, FTC spokesperson Frank Dorman was unsure: “The FTC enforces the FTC Act against deceptive or unfair business practices, so it’s conceivable, but this might be something for the FDA,” Dorman wrote by email.","FDA spokesperson Peter Cassell told BuzzFeed News that the agency has received “at least two complaints” related to Jilly Juice (not including the two that the Ohio Attorney General passed on). He would not comment on whether the FDA is investigating these complaints.","“Marketing unapproved products that claim to prevent, diagnose, treat or cure cancer without evidence is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective,” Cassell wrote by email.","However, the FDA has not yet determined whether Epperly’s website and videos fall under its purview, since she does not sell a food or drug product.","No one seems to be able, or inclined, to make Epperly stop.","“It blows my mind that no authority will step in and say, hey lady, you need a license. You need to educate yourself properly. You need to not tell parents to give this to their children behind closed doors,” Thomas said.","Meanwhile, Epperly continues to give juice updates to the 5,000-plus followers on her personal Facebook page. Recently, she explained via live video that she had found affirmation for another of her theories: that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer. On her new website, she put up a video claiming that Jilly Juice could possibly prevent autism and obesity in kids.","Much of her Facebook page’s discussion lately has revolved around her upcoming appearance on the Dr. Phil show, where she intends to face her detractors in front of a national television audience. “Let's bring it on baby and I'm only going to go on if I'm allowed to plug my book and my website,” she posted on March 6.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that going on TV will be an opportunity to get it all out in the open. “It’s gonna be like Jerry Springer — I’m gonna have my haters on there. Hopefully there won’t be any chairs thrown at me.” ●"],"isopubdate":""}

One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised ‘systemic problems’ with Facebook’s business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform.","The head of European Parliament said on Monday that EU lawmakers will investigate whether the data misuse has taken place, adding the allegation is an unacceptable violation of citizens’ privacy rights.","Facebook was already facing new calls for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after the reports from the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend.","The papers reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, and that the information had not been deleted despite Facebook demands dating back to 2015.","“We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a “sell” rating on a stock that rose 60 per cent last year.","Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before.","He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company’s business for now, with advertisers unlikely to “suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform.”","The losses would be Facebook’s biggest daily fall since a broader market pullback in February.

But, the fact remains that the data existed within Facebook for it to be mined. If the data was legally accessed, it would have been fair game and we wouldn’t be talking about it.","Let’s not forget that the point of data mining and analytics is to gain advantage over the competition. They help sway decisions, opinions, and elections.","It’s not that complicated. We are all part of some data set.","The “Terms & Conditions” that we sign off, without fully reading, probably includes waivers that provide companies the right to the information that they gather.","I have shared my likes and preferences with companies to help them serve me better.

The “find me follow me” feature on office communication systems plays big brother and sends my calls to wherever I am, whether I like it or not.","My phone knows every location that I have visited ever since I turned location services on. If you have a company phone, no more goofing off during work hours.","Facial recognition software and cameras deployed in a number of places ensure that I can be picked out of a crowd if ever the need arose. It will get worse. Some countries like China openly use the technology for law-enforcement.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Related Coverage","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted.”","FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is seen at the Facebook Gather conference in Brussels, Belgium January 23, 2018.

(Thomas Peter/Reuters)","By John Pomfret","March 27","When a woman walked to work this month in the bustling Southern Chinese metropolis of Shenzhen, she, like many millions of other Chinese, jaywalked, cutting across a side street to avoid a detour of hundreds of yards to a crosswalk. What happened next, as documented by the woman, a writer calling herself Mao Yan, was an illustration of a brave new world being born in China.","Two traffic policemen approached the woman and told her that she had violated the traffic regulations of the People’s Republic of China. Eager to get to her job, Mao Yan apologized and pointed out that there was no fencing to block jaywalkers like her. She hoped to get off with a verbal warning. The officers, however, were intent on prosecution. They demanded her identity card, which is issued to all Chinese citizens. When Mao Yan said that she had not brought hers, they asked for her ID number. When she said she had not memorized it, one officer snapped her picture with a camera phone. Seconds later he read out her name, her ID card number and date of birth. Using facial recognition technology, he had identified Mao Yan.","Then Mao Yan heard the clatter of a printer from a nearby police kiosk. One of the officers entered the kiosk and returned with a slip. “It was my first ever traffic citation,” Mao Yan wrote. On the citation was a QR code that she scanned to pay her fine via a messaging app called WeChat that is managed by Tencent, a private Chinese company.","Mao Yan was taken aback by the experience and what she called “the stunning efficiency of the facial recognition technology possessed by our traffic police.” She shared her story with friends, who told her she was lucky that she had not crossed against a light. If she had, police could have put her face, her full name and several digits of her ID card number on a public bulletin board for everyone to see. “Jaywalkers have fewer rights than criminal suspects,” she wrote, pointing out that in Chinese news reports, suspects are often not fully identified and their faces are blotted out.","Mao Yan’s Shenzhen is part of one of the great social experiments of mankind — the use of massive amounts of data, combined with facial recognition technology, shaming and artificial intelligence to control a population via marriage of the state and private companies. Already on the packed highways of Shanghai, honking has decreased. That’s because directional microphones coupled with high-definition cameras can identify and ticket — again, via WeChat — noisy drivers and display their names, photographs and identity card numbers on the city’s many LED boards. On some streets, if drivers stop their cars by the side of the road longer than seven minutes, high-definition cameras identify the driver and, again, issue him or her an instant ticket.","In other parts of China the technology is being used by the state security apparatus to crack down on separatism. In Xinjiang, which has been the site of a separatist movement against Chinese rule, China’s police have established a 21st-century police state through an infrastructure of security technology with high-definition cameras, facial-recognition technology, iris and body scanners at checkpoints, the forced collection of DNA, and the mandatory use of apps that monitor messages on smartphones. The focus of this campaign is the Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group that is mostly Muslim.","But as Mao Yan’s story makes clear, this technology is bleeding into the rest of China, where 95 percent of the population is Han Chinese. And China’s authorities won’t be content with traffic stops. Their goal is behavioral modification on a massive scale. Chinese planners have announced their intention to tap the vast AI and surveillance infrastructure currently under construction to generate “social credit” scores for all of China’s 1.5 billion people. With a high score, traveling, securing a loan, buying a car and other benefits will be easy to come by. Run afoul of the authorities, and problems begin.","Some Chinese businessmen who are benefiting from this massive investment in data have argued that the Chinese are less concerned about privacy than people in the United States. Robin Li, the founder of Baidu, China’s version of Google, which routinely shares its data with the Chinese Communist Party, argued over the weekend that Chinese people don’t care that much about privacy. “The Chinese people are more open or less sensitive about the privacy issue,” said Li, speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing. “If they are able to trade privacy for convenience, safety and efficiency, in a lot of cases, they are willing to do that.” Ironically, Li’s remarks were released by the Chinese magazine Caixin on the same day that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for releasing user data to a political consultancy.","In her article, Mao Yan didn’t seem to agree with Li’s optimistic interpretation of the campaign. “Maybe,” she wrote, “it’s intimidation to make everyone afraid.” I think she’s right. Hours after Mao Yan posted her story on China’s Internet, censors took it down.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","John PomfretJohn Pomfret, a former Washington Post bureau chief in Beijing, is the author of “The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom: America and China, 1776 to the Present.” Follow"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

It did not say why the Facebook boss himself could not appear.","Mr Zuckerberg has been repeatedly criticised for his failure to speak publicly about the allegations of data abuse made in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The reply letter to Damian Collins came from Rebecca Stimson, Facebook’s head of public policy in the UK. It said that Facebook took the request from parliament seriously.","“Facebook fully recognises the level of public and parliamentary interest in these issues, and supports your belief that these issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position to answer your questions,” it read.","“As such Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence to the Committee.”","The letter also claimed that only 1 per cent of downloads of thisisyourdigitallife – the app that Cambridge Analytica used to harvest data about users without their knowledge – had come from the UK.","Damian Collins said that the DCMS committee will be “very happy to hear from Mr Cox to give evidence”, but that he still wanted to speak to Zuckerberg.","He said that it wasn’t clear from the letter “whether he is available as well”, and suggested that parliament would consider setting up a “video link if that is more convenient for him”.","Mr Collins also suggested that it still expected Mr Zuckerberg to come if he couldn’t convincingly say why he shouldn’t.","“He stated in interviews that if he is the right person to appear, he will appear,” he said. ”We think he is the right person and look forward to hearing from him.”","Mr Collins’s original letter, sent last week, accused Facebook of having “consistently understated” the risks of abuse of data by the company, and that they had been “misleading to the Committee”.","“It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,” he said.","He then addressed Mr Zuckerberg directly: “Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to ‘fixing’ Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","Read More","Facebook's move to suspend Cambridge Analytica came just hours before The New York Times and the British newspaper The Observer both released reports that raised questions about the handling of Facebook data by the company and its associates.","In a statement, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied that the organization is in violation of Facebook's terms and said it is in communication with Facebook following the news it had been suspended from the platform.","The spokesperson said that in 2014, Cambridge Analytica contracted with Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR) \"to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,\" obtaining data and seeking \"the informed consent of each respondent.\"","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" the spokesperson added.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Sen. Mark Warner called the suspension \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West.\"","Warner, a Virginia Democrat, serves as vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. In his statement, he added: \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Cambridge University acknowledged they knew of Kogan's company, Global Science Research (GSR), but said they do not believe \"he used University data or facilities for his work with GSR, and therefore that there is no reason to believe the University's data and facilities were used as the basis for GSR's subsequent work with any other party.\"","\"It is important to make clear that, despite its name, Cambridge Analytica has no connection or association with the University whatsoever.\"","Cambridge Analytica was hired in summer 2016 as part of the Trump campaign's three-pronged data operation.","Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica until he stepped down to run the Trump campaign in August 2016.","William A. Burck, an attorney for Bannon, said in a statement on Bannon's behalf: \"The first Mr. Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days. He has nothing to say because he knows nothing about the claims being asserted and would direct questions to Mr. Nix, who ran Cambridge Analytica the entire time Mr. Bannon was associated with it.","\"We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,\" Denham's statement said.","\"It's part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people's personal information to micro target voters,\" she added.","CNN previously reported in October 2017 that the firm had contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016 regarding thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails kept on a private server while she was secretary of state, according to four sources familiar with the outreach.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Aleander Nix sent an email that said he had reached out to Assange in attempt to access emails from Clinton's private server in hopes to create a searchable database of the emails for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee, according to two sources.","CNN reported that no one from the Trump campaign was copied on the email, the sources said. Nix sent the email in the summer of 2016, two sources said, but it is not clear whether he sent it before or after Cambridge Analytica was brought onto the campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}
