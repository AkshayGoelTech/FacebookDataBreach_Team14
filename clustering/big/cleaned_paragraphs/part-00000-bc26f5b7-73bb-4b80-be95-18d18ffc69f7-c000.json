The real story was much worse. In total, more than 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested by Cambridge Analytica to build a system to target U.S. voters with political ads, a whistleblower told the papers. Even more stunning, though the firm told Facebook that it had deleted all the data, it turns out that Cambridge Analytics “still possesses most or all of the trove.”","Watch the Guardian’s video interview with former Cambridge researcher and whistleblower Christopher Wylie:","For the firm’s leaders, including board member and later Trump adviser Steve Bannon, it was all about doing battle against their political enemies. “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” CA founder Christopher Wylie told the Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","The firm, which assisted the Trump campaign with targeting voters and received a $15 million investment from conservative donor Robert Mercer, is now in the headlights of congressional investigators and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose team demanded and received in December internal documents about its work on the campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}
{"originalurl":"http://www.news.world/2018/03/17/trump-campaign-linked-data-firm-cambridge-analytica-reportedly-collected-info-on-50m-facebook-profiles/","title":"Trump campaign-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica reportedly collected info on 50M Facebook profiles | News World","text":["Cambridge Analytica had worked with University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, who had developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” and obtained user information — which the Times is reporting scooped up information on profiles of as many as 50 million users. Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I’m going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie.

Here are four.","1. It’s excellent but too open to copycats","Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service. Text the word ‘NEWS’ to 22840.","You might be the smartest entrepreneur in the room by coming up with something unique yet straightforward.","We all agree that there’s something beautiful in simplicity, but when it comes to business, the simplicity of an ideamight turn out to be a demerit. This is especially true if the barriers to entry are minimal to none.","The open business approach model is risky in sectors where patenting of ideas is wanting.","This, therefore, means that the idea that can be duplicated by anyone as soon as they notice you’re succeeding.","A wise investor will hesitate to invest in such a venture because there’s very little leverage. It can also be tough to scale such a business in cases where the industry gets inflated with new entrants.","It is one thing to develop a great idea, but it’s another to define it and explain it to your target customers and investors. It may make sense in your mind, but you have to be able to translate your value offering to others. Fine-tune your thoughts and narrow your business’ promise to three points.","Research has shown that people are able to retain things in multiples of three, so take advantage of that.","Do your research and consult widely to gain the clarity you need to sell your product or service.","Your great idea may sometimes overwhelm you as an entrepreneur. When you know that your idea is unique, you can easily get carried away when it comes to pricing or valuation. And if you’re not careful, this greed can blind you and cause you to price yourself out of the market.","Be realistic with your numbers. Value your time and input fairly, and be sure you’ve put in your own investment before asking others to buy equity in your business.","And when it comes to selling your final product to customers, don’t add huge margins simply because you can.","Conventional wisdom suggests a mark-up of between 35 per cent and 50 per cent of your costs to arrive at a retail price. That means if it cost you Sh100 to make a product, at a 50 per cent mark-up, you’d end up with a Sh150 retail price.","Try not to get outrageous with your pricing as you may lose out on excellent opportunities to build your business.","North and South Korea to bid for 2032 Summer Olympics","North and South Korea will bid jointly for the 2032 Olympics, they announced Wednesday, in an ambitious plan built on hopes of deepening a diplomatic thaw catalysed by this year’s Winter Games in the South.","The idea, which would require an unprecedented level of cooperation and mutual trust on the long-divided Korean peninsula, was included in a joint statement issued after a Pyongyang summit between the North’s leader Kim Jong Un and the South’s President Moon Jae-in.","“The South and North agreed to actively participate jointly in international competitions including the 2020 Summer Olympics and to cooperate in bidding for the South-North joint hosting of the 2032 Summer Olympics,” the statement said.","No other details were given.","The North’s decision to participate in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February triggered a dramatic diplomatic turnaround on the peninsula this year.","It came after tensions mounted the previous year, with the North carrying out multiple missile launches and its most powerful nuclear test to date, and Kim trading personal insults and threats of war with US President Donald Trump.","The February games saw athletes from the two Koreas march together at the opening ceremony behind a unification flag showing an undivided peninsula.","The two countries also formed a unified women’s ice hockey side — a move initially controversial in the South, with critics saying that Seoul was depriving its own citizens of a chance to play on the Olympic stage.","Kim sent his sister Kim Yo Jong to Pyeongchang as his personal envoy, and the two leaders have since met three times as part of an ongoing diplomatic rapprochement.","The two Koreas have continued their sports diplomacy, forming joint teams for the ITTF world table tennis championships and several events at the Asian Games in Indonesia, securing one gold, one silver and two bronze medals.","They have also held friendly basketball matches.","Olympics chief Thomas Bach said this month he was open to talks with the two Koreas about marching and competing together at the 2020 Tokyo Games.","It is a marked contrast to the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics, which Pyongyang boycotted after it demanded co-hosting rights and negotiations fell apart over how to share the events.","North Korea’s participation in hosting the Games, which include thousands of athletes from around the world and an even larger number of spectators, would be a watershed event requiring a degree of openness and financial muscle now lacking in the isolated and impoverished country.","It would also force an extraordinary level of cooperation between two Cold War foes that have no formal avenues for regular contact and are still technically at war.","The first hint of a possible joint bid came last week when South Korea’s Yonhap news agency quoted the country’s sports minister Do Jong-hwan as saying Seoul planned to propose the idea during this week’s Pyongyang meeting.","For the 2030 Fifa World Cup, Do said South Korea planned to propose a co-hosted tournament involving China, Japan and the two Koreas.","“In this way, we could maintain the current momentum for peace and expand peace on the Korean peninsula to the whole region”, Do said.","Three things we learned from Liverpool v Paris Saint-Germain","Liverpool beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-2 in a dramatic Champions League Group C opener at Anfield on Tuesday.","Here are three things we learned from the clash of two of the leading contenders for the Champions League title:","Back in Champions League action for the first time since last season’s agonising final defeat against Real Madrid, Liverpool erased the bitter taste of that loss with a thrilling success against the star-studded French champions.","Eight of Jurgen Klopp’s starting line-up began the 3-1 defeat in Kiev four months ago and that group were determined to make amends.","The Reds won four and drew two of their home games in this competition in 2017-18, including memorable victories over Manchester City and Roma in the knock-out stages.","Recalling those epic demolitions, Klopp’s side tore into PSG with two goals in six minutes late in the first half through Daniel Sturridge and a James Milner penalty.","Thomas Meunier’s 40th-minute reply made it a tense second half and when Kylian Mbappe’s equalised with seven minutes left, Liverpool could have buckled.","But Roberto Firmino came off the bench to snatch the points with a dramatic stoppage-time winner just days after suffering a nasty eye injury against Tottenham.","No wonder the jubilant Brazilian celebrated by jokingly covering his wounded eye as he ran to the crowd.","Sturridge seized a rare moment in the European spotlight as the Liverpool striker marked his first Champions League start for six years with a crucial goal.","Sturridge was handed his first start for Liverpool this season because of the injury Firmino sustained in a challenge with Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen.","England international Sturridge made up for lost time, breaking the deadlock in the 30th minute when he met Andrew Robertson’s pin-point cross with a clinical close-range header.","It was Sturridge’s first goal since the opening day of the season against West Ham and the 29-year-old’s first in the Champions League since he netted against Maribor in November 2017.","Sturridge’s crucial contribution served as a welcome reminder of his talent at a time when his injury-plagued career is at a cross-roads following his dismal loan spell at West Brom in the second half of last season.","“This team is built for winning the Champions League. They have unbelievable quality,” Liverpool manager boss Klopp had said when asked about the threat posed by the French champions.","But, although PSG have won five Ligue 1 titles in the past six seasons, they have yet to progress beyond the quarter-finals in the Champions League since being bought by their Qatari owners.","Thomas Tuchel’s side once again flattered to deceive on the big occasion as they delivered a lacklustre display at Anfield.","Their gritty fightback would have papered over the cracks, but, not the for the first time, PSG cracked under pressure in the final moments — a familiar feeling for Tuchel after he lost an enthralling Europa League quarter-final at Liverpool two years ago."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

When they met the following day, she led him down a hallway praising his performance. However, when she opened the door to a meeting room, he came face to face with members of Facebook’s secretive “rat-catching” team, led by the company’s head of investigations, Sonya Ahuja.","The interrogation was a technicality; they already knew he was guilty of leaking some innocuous information to the press. They had records of a screenshot he’d taken, links he had clicked or hovered over, and they strongly indicated they had accessed chats between him and the journalist, dating back to before he joined the company.","Contact the Guardian securely","Read more","“It’s horrifying how much they know,” he told the Guardian, on the condition of anonymity. “You go into Facebook and it has this warm, fuzzy feeling of ‘we’re changing the world’ and ‘we care about things’. But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg’s secret police.”","The public image of Silicon Valley’s tech giants is all colourful bicycles, ping-pong tables, beanbags and free food, but behind the cartoonish facade is a ruthless code of secrecy. They rely on a combination of Kool-Aid, digital and physical surveillance, legal threats and restricted stock units to prevent and detect intellectual property theft and other criminal activity. However, those same tools are also used to catch employees and contractors who talk publicly, even if it’s about their working conditions, misconduct or cultural challenges within the company.","Zuckerberg hosts weekly meetings where he shares details of unreleased new products and strategies in front of thousands of employees. Even junior staff members and contractors can see what other teams are working on by looking at one of many of the groups on the company’s internal version of Facebook.","“When you first get to Facebook you are shocked at the level of transparency. You are trusted with a lot of stuff you don’t need access to,” said Evans, adding that during his induction he was warned not to look at ex-partners’ Facebook accounts.","“The counterbalance to giving you this huge trusting environment is if anyone steps out of line, they’ll squash you like a bug.”","The Google campus in Mountain View, California. The company has been sued for using overly broad confidentiality agreements and getting employees to spy on each other. Photograph: JasonDoiy/Getty Images","During one of Zuckerberg’s weekly meetings in 2015, after word of its new messaging assistant spread, the usually affable CEO warned employees: “We’re going to find the leaker, and we’re going to fire them.” A week later came the public shaming: Zuck revealed the culprit had been caught and fired. People at the meeting applauded.","“Companies routinely use business records in workplace investigations, and we are no exception,” said a Facebook spokeswoman, Bertie Thomson.","It’s a similar story at Google. Staff use an internal version of Google Plus and thousands of mailing lists to discuss everything from homeownership to items for sale, as well as social issues like neoconservatism and diversity. With the exception of James Damore’s explosive memo about gender and tech, most of it doesn’t leak.","By and large, staff buy into the corporate mission in a happy-clappy campus which helps foster a tribal mentality that discourages treachery. Employees are also rewarded with annual allocations of restricted stock that can buy silence for years after leaving.","“You would never do something that screws up the company’s chance of success because you are directly affected by it,” said a former Googler Justin Maxwell, who noted the pressure to behave in a “Googley” way.","The search engine’s former head of investigations, Brian Katz, highlighted this in 2016 in a company-wide email titled: “Internal only. Really.”","“If you’re considering sharing confidential information to a reporter – or to anyone externally – for the love of all that’s Googley, please reconsider! Not only could it cost you your job, but it also betrays the values that makes [sic] us a community,” he wrote.","This email came to light after another former employee sued Google for its overzealous approach to preventing leaks using overly broad confidentiality agreements and getting employees to spy on and report each other. The legal complaint alleges that Google’s policies violate labour laws that allow employees to discuss workplace conditions, wages and potential legal violations inside the company. Both parties are scheduled to enter mediation later this year.","James Damore, the software engineer who was fired from Google after writing a controversial memo questioning diversity programmes, suspects he was being monitored by the company during his final days.","He also described “weird things” happening to his work phone and laptop after the memo went viral. “All the internal apps updated at the same time, which had never happened before. I had to re-sign in to my Google account on both devices and my Google Drive – where the document was – stopped working.”","Damore said that much of the spying capabilities were outlined in his contract and that it was mostly “necessary” for a company that gives “everyone access to secret things”.","After he was fired, Damore stopped using his personal Gmail account in favour of Yahoo email out of fear that Google might be spying on him. “My lawyer doesn’t think they are above doing that,” he said.","However, a Google spokeswoman said the company never reads personal email accounts and denied spying on Damore’s devices.","“I wouldn’t expect them to admit to it,” Damore said.","Since Damore’s memo, Google has become much leakier, particularly around internal discussions of racial and gender diversity.","“It’s a cry for help internally,” said another former Googler, who now runs a startup.","He said people at Google had for years put up with covert sexism, internal biases or, in his case, a manager with anger management problems. “No one would do anything until one day a VP saw the guy yelling at me in the hallway.","“People have been dealing with this stuff for years and are finally thinking ‘if Google isn’t going to do something about it, we’re going to leak it’.”","Everyone was paranoid. When we texted each other, we’d use code if we needed to talk about work","For low-paid contractors who do the grunt work for big tech companies, the incentive to keep silent is more stick than carrot. What they lack in stock options and a sense of corporate tribalism, they make up for in fear of losing their jobs.","One European Facebook content moderator signed a contract, seen by the Guardian, which granted the company the right to monitor and record his social media activities, including his personal Facebook account, as well as emails, phone calls and internet use. He also agreed to random personal searches of his belongings including bags, briefcases and car while on company premises. Refusal to allow such searches would be treated as gross misconduct.","Following Guardian reporting into working conditions of community operations analysts at Facebook’s European headquarters in Dublin, the company clamped down further, he said.","Contractors would be questioned if they took photographs in the office or printed emails or documents. “On more than one occasion someone would print something and you’d find management going through the log to see what they had printed,” said one former worker.","Security teams would leave “mouse traps” – USB keys containing data that were left around the office to test staff loyalty. “If you find a USB or something you’d have to give it in straight away. If you plugged it into a computer it would throw up a flare and you’d be instantly escorted out of the building.”","“Everyone was paranoid. When we texted each other we’d use code if we needed to talk about work and meet up in person to talk about it in private,” he said.","Some employees switch their phones off or hide them out of fear that their location is being tracked. One current Facebook employee who recently spoke to Wired asked the reporter to turn off his phone so the company would have a harder time tracking if it had been near the phones of anyone from Facebook.","James Damore stopped using his personal Gmail account after being fired, due to fears Google was spying on him. Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer for the Guardian","Two security researchers confirmed that this would be technically simple for Facebook to do if both people had the Facebook app on their phone and location services switched on. Even if location services aren’t switched on, Facebook can infer someone’s location from wifi access points.","“We do not use cellphones to track employee locations, nor do we track locations of people who do not work at Facebook, including reporters,” said Thomson.","Companies will also hire external agencies to surveil their staff. One such firm, Pinkerton, counts Google and Facebook among its clients.","Among other services, Pinkerton offers to send investigators to coffee shops or restaurants near a company’s campus to eavesdrop on employees’ conversations.","Big data for the people: it's time to take it back from our tech overlords","Read more","“If we hear anything about a new product coming, or new business ventures or something to do with stocks, we’ll feed that information back to corporate security,” said David Davari, a managing director at the firm, adding that the focus is usually IP theft or insider trading.","Facebook and Google both deny using this service.","Through LinkedIn searches, the Guardian found several former Pinkerton investigators to have subsequently been hired by Facebook, Google and Apple.","“These tools are common, widespread, intrusive and legal,” said Al Gidari, consulting director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.","“Companies are required to take steps to detect and deter criminal misconduct, so it’s not surprising they are using the same tools to make sure employees are in compliance with their contractual obligations.”","This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Acting director Tom Pahl made the announcement in a statement which immediately sent Facebook’s share price plunging yesterday. He also raised the prospect of a fine for the social network because it had entered into a ‘consent decree’ in 2011 about the use of personal data and any breach of that can be punished by the regulator. If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","Meanwhile, Facebook is still not being fully forthcoming about its data leak, Senator Mark Warner said, as he called for Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress “and not just put an ad in newspapers.” Zuckerberg has taken out full-page ads in nine major US and British publications to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But Warner, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says Facebook has not been fully transparent about its previously unreported data leak and is calling on CEO Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. He told NBC’s Meet The Press: “I don’t think Facebook has been fully forthcoming. I called out Facebook back in December of ’16. In the spring of ’17, I questioned micro-targeting and the use of this really sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica. Early on for most of 2017, they blew that off.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/665738?unlock=LMSKO2FOPS1DVY50","title":"Why Now? Facebook’s “Perfect Storm” Reinvigorates Old Privacy Fears","text":["When the firestorm now engulfing Facebook first kicked up earlier this month, it took many data-privacy experts by surprise.","But their surprise wasn’t at Facebook’s move to quietly share the personal data of around 50 million users with Cambridge Analytica, a British political consultancy that worked with the Trump campaign last cycle. Instead, researchers were shocked to see the American public seething over data-sharing practices that tech companies—and political campaigns—have routinely exploited for the better part of a decade.","“It really isn’t so different than issues that a lot of us have been shouting from the rooftops about for years,” said David O’Brien, a senior researcher at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. “This is an industry-wide problem, and there are a lot of players who are doing the same thing that Facebook is.”","Americans have historically responded to breaches of electronic privacy with shrugged shoulders. Yet Facebook’s sudden predicament—the company’s stock continues to crater, users are deleting their accounts, lawmakers are calling for hearings, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating, and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is elbow-deep in an extended apology tour—feels different.","No one factor can explain why consumers are suddenly wise to the tech industry’s deployment of their data. But a hyper-partisan and paranoia-fueled political environment, previous Facebook missteps, and Silicon Valley’s fast-fading reputation all help explain why the scandal spiraled so quickly.","“I think Cambridge Analytica is the perfect storm of so many different things coming together at exactly the right moment to make people care,” said Daniel Kreiss, who researches data’s impact on politics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.","When compared to the broader tech-industry ecosystem, the story of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica isn’t entirely business-as-usual. Though details remain scarce, in 2014 a Russian-American researcher collected the data of around 50 million users through an online personality survey whose terms and conditions gave the creator unauthorized access to the Facebook “friends” of all who downloaded the app.","That data was then shared—reportedly without Facebook’s consent—with Cambridge Analytica, which in turn may have used it to create “psychographic” profiles of each user in order to target them with online political ads crafted to trigger the person’s unique anxieties.","But the public doesn’t seem particularly upset over the apparent breach of contract between Facebook and a third-party researcher. Instead, its concerns seem focused on the notion that such data collection and profiling is widespread, or even possible.","Tom Pendergast, the chief security and privacy strategist at consulting firm MediaPro, thinks the public should have known better. “We always knew this was true,” he said. “Every single way that you interact with these social portfolios is being used to build up a profile about you, and then retarget you.","“It’s the old adage of, ‘If you’re getting a service for free, you’re the product,’” Pendergast added.","That’s true not only for companies hawking goods and services online, but also for political campaigns. President Obama’s groundbreaking use of big data was hailed as a game-changer in the 2012 election. But his campaign also used Facebook data gleaned from apps without user consent.","“It sounded to me like [Cambridge Analytica] did a lot of stuff that Obama did in 2012,” said Kreiss, adding that both campaigns appeared to rely on Facebook-derived data to predict voter behavior.","American views on Facebook, data privacy, and politics in general have changed enormously over the last six years. And while Obama’s use of social-media data was deemed groundbreaking, Trump’s use of similar data is now cast in a manipulative, sinister light.","Much of that shift can be chalked up to the difference between the abstract and concrete understanding of data threats in 2018. No one feels particularly attacked by an advertisement for a favorite type of shoes, even if it’s clear the company is aware of that preference only through the targeted use of data. But throw in political beliefs and “psychographic” targeting designed to break you down where you’re weakest, and the issue begins to feel personal.","“There hasn’t been a real vivid example of how information is extracted on a massive scale and then weaponized against you,” said Woodrow Hartzog, a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University. “To rob people of agency in a really important, core area of identity, which is political expression, ideology—the idea that we’ve lost control of so much, to lose this as well is just difficult to swallow.”","If political manipulation is always a sensitive subject, it’s especially sensitive at this point in American history. Facebook’s misfortune was to become ensnared in a scandal along with a historically unpopular president, who is also working to fend off accusations of collusion between his campaign and the Russian government.","The fact that the scandal dovetails so perfectly to the story of shady dealings and foreign election meddling—right down to the Russian researcher at the center of it all—has likely given the story more legs than it would have had otherwise. And it’s even more damaging when coupled with Facebook’s other privacy scandals and its role in spreading “fake news” and Russian propaganda during the 2016 election, behavior for which Zuckerberg has already had to eat crow.","“I think people can only hear Mark Zuckerberg apologize for a privacy mistake so many times,” Hartzog said.","There’s also the rapidly shifting backdrop of the public’s broader relationship with the tech world. “Silicon Valley is culturally understood in a radically different way than it was four years ago, and that’s from both sides of the aisle,” Kreiss said. While liberals look askance at the industry’s rapid accumulation of power, conservatives view the tech giants as biased gatekeepers with their thumbs on the scale.","Combine that new skepticism with the sea change on privacy now underway in Europe—sweeping new data regulations are set to take effect on the continent in May, and experts say some spillover from those rules is already affecting the U.S.—and there are signs that America’s once-blasé attitude toward data protection may be hardening. “I think we may be seeing a backlash of corporate control of data,” Pendergast said.","How far that backlash will reach remains to be seen. While Facebook and Cambridge Analytica’s use of consumer data mirrors industry activity more broadly, the focus of Capitol Hill and the public is so far fixated on Facebook alone. Twitter, Google, and other firms with similar business models have remained silent and are likely to stay that way for as long as they can.","“My fear is that this may become a Facebook-concentrated problem,” said Hartzog, “rather than thinking about all the platforms out there and the entire set of incentives that every platform has to collect and use data.”","If history is any guide, the public is likely to settle down over the next several weeks. After that, policymakers will feel free to target a narrow problem—perhaps the influence of big data in politics, especially as it relates to foreign meddling—while neglecting to address the relationship between data, consumers, and corporations more broadly.","“The history of every violation of user expectation of privacy has been a period of outcry followed by a normalization of that perceived violation in some way,” Kreiss said. “That’s the Facebook story: Users get up in arms about some sort of change they believe has violated their privacy in some way, it’s kind of business-as-usual, things get normalized, and folks carry on just as before.”","\"Christine Blasey Ford told Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley Tuesday night that she wants the FBI to investigate her claims of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, raising further doubts about whether she and Kavanaugh will appear before the committee on Monday.\" Grassley still wants her to","IN AFTERMATH OF FLORENCE","Trump Visiting Carolinas Tomorrow","16 hours ago","THE LATEST","\"It is not yet clear where in North Carolina Trump is expected visit.

It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","We have updated the story accordingly.","Original story:","Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer, will shift roles at the company. His transition will come in the wake of disagreements with other Facebook executives like COO Sheryl Sandberg about how to investigate and disclose Russian activity on the platform, The New York Times reports, citing employees of the social network. Stamos advocated for greater disclosure. Prior to his hiring at Facebook in 2015, Stamos was Chief Information Security Officer at Yahoo.","Personnel on Stamos’ security team—which previously numbered 120 but is now down to three—are being gradually transferred to the product and infrastructure divisions within Facebook, under his supervision. The NYT report suggests that this has been part of his responsibilities since December, when his normal day-to-day responsibilities as CSO were reassigned. He was asked by Facebook to stay through August for optics.","Stamos is currently working in a new role in the company. “I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security,” he tweeted. He has not commented on any future plans to depart the organization entirely—a tweet clarifying his role after The New York Times report did not dispute the report’s claim that he is leaving Facebook in August.","This news broke shortly after Facebook came under intense scrutiny over the inappropriate acquisition of its user data by Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm involved in elections in both the US and the UK. Stamos took to Twitter to defend the company—in particular, he sought to clarify that this was not a “data breach.” He also said in a tweet that has since been deleted:","It should be noted that several other prominent platforms, like Android and iOS, allow access to friend (contact) data with user permission. Like us, those platforms have policies about the use of data, but misusing contacts gathered knowingly from a phone is also not a “breach”.","Stamos later deleted those tweets, saying he “should have done a better job weighing in.” Echoing some of the concerns that reportedly led to his departure from the role, he later tweeted:","There are a lot of big problems that the big tech companies need to be better at fixing.

{"originalurl":"https://www.workshopdigital.com/blog/facebook-cambridge-analytica-the-fallout-for-advertisers/","title":"Facebook & Cambridge Analytica: The Fallout For Advertisers | Workshop Digital","text":["Facebook & Cambridge Analytica: The Fallout For Advertisers","Who is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica (CA) is a political consulting firm that specializes in data mining and analytics for the purpose of political persuasion through microtargeting. CA has worked on in U.S. elections for several years, including Congressional and state-level elections in 2014. Ted Cruz hired CA during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primary election; Donald Trump hired CA after securing the nomination.","The firm has also worked in Argentina, Kenya, Nigeria, and India. CA is not unique: Many large data analytics companies offer similar services for politicians, and microtargeting has been a major part of American politics since about 2004.","What did Cambridge Analytica actually do?","CA collected mass amounts of Facebook user data and used algorithms to create lists of audiences based on, among other things, users’ psychological profiles. CA then used these highly customized lists to micro-target ads during the election season, honing in on swing states and, more specifically, swing voters in swing states.","Why is this scandalous?","There are many concerns about how CA collected their data. Much of the psychological profile information came from a university researcher (Aleksandr Kogan) who built a personality test app on Facebook. This app was approved under the guise of “academic research.”","While the app prompted users to accept terms and conditions—which stated that their data could be used for marketing purposes—the app also pulled information from all friends of app users, who had no ability to protect their data. The data collected by the app was then sold to Cambridge Analytica, who used it for political purposes.","There is also concern about how CA used their data, including whether they worked with Russian operatives to push Russian-made propaganda to their microtargeted audiences. CA intentionally used ambiguous Facebook pages and content formats not traceable to any specific campaign or Super PAC. This supported their goal to spread organic “Likes” and shares that could not be traced back to the content’s origin.","An Advertiser’s Perspective","How is Cambridge Analytica different from a very intelligent white-hat advertiser?","Targeting options for all Facebook advertisers are:","Facebook’s pre-defined interest lists","Demographic segments such as education and parental status","Users who have liked the advertiser’s page/event/app and their friends","“Custom audiences,” which include users who have interacted with a business (visited the website, signed up for a newsletter, made a purchase, etc.)","The differences between CA and traditional advertisers was the data collection method and the massive scale of the audience lists.","CA pulled vast amounts of data from the Facebook Graph API and added it to their voting history and personality trait data. They pushed this data through their proprietary algorithms to create very specific voter profiles. Then, they created custom audiences based on those voter profiles to target them with ads and boosted posts.","An important distinction is that users/customers added to a traditional advertiser’s custom audience list had to interact with the business for it to collect their data. When a user visits a business website, the terms of service note that the site uses cookies, which can be used for advertising. Similar terms of service information is provided at the time of a sale or the creation of an account. CA’s app did not have any interaction, disclosure, or opt-out options for the friends of app users.","Most savvy advertisers follow some of the same logic of CA in their social advertising strategy. Given a large enough customer base, advertisers should segment these custom audiences into more curated lists:","Customers who make multiple purchases","Large-purchase customers","Subscribers to a basic service who can be upsold","Users who have not purchased but showed interest through micro-conversions","Customers who can safely be ignored for marketing purposes","There are many creative ways to build and use custom audience lists. However, traditional white-hat advertisers do not have any information about the personalities of their customers and target them based only on trackable interactions of that user with the business.","What, if anything, is changing due to this scandal?","In 2015, Facebook reduced the amount of data available through the Graph API and removed the friends-of-app-users loophole, meaning that CA’s questionable data gathering methods are already obsolete. Facebook has also recently announced a “crackdown” on how developers use their platform, so advertisers who wish to utilize Facebook’s Graph API may have more limitations on their usage. As Facebook takes more precautions, it could be more difficult to have your API usage application approved.","In the future, we may see more government regulations on how businesses collect customer data. For example, simply having data collection consent within the terms of service may not be enough to collect the data legally.","Facebook has now announced that they will no longer show the estimated audience reach for any campaigns using Custom Audience targeting. This change is due to a security flaw discovered by researchers at Northeastern University (rather than the Cambridge Analytica fallout), but we can expect Facebook to continue to focus on Custom Audience lists and how they are used following the election scandal.","What has Workshop Digital taken away from this situation?","The most important reminder for advertisers is to be extremely careful with any personal data, both how it’s stored and how it’s utilized.","For most advertisers, the use of personal data is relatively straightforward and benign—we show advertisements to users who are most interested in our product or service. It makes sense to show ads to current customers if there’s a potential for an upsell, or to avoid showing ads to them if it’s a one-time purchase.","For Workshop Digital specifically, the CA controversy does not impact any of our current advertising methods.","Facebook’s pre-populated interest and demographic lists, which are what Workshop Digital uses for most of our Facebook prospecting campaigns, are not impacted by any changes in personal data sharing – we do not receive any customer information from Facebook when utilizing these lists.","The custom audience lists utilized by Workshop Digital are either built off of users who either visited our client’s website or users who have directly given our client their email and other personal information. We are not gaining this customer information in any way that could be considered sneaky or unethical.","First-party cookies are a standard of internet marketing and only track the user based on browser information (nothing personally identifiable)","The customer information used for creating custom audience lists is no different than that used in direct mail marketing, email marketing, and many other standard marketing channels. The customer list info is sent directly from the client to Facebook and all personally identifiable info is hashed in this process, preventing anyone from stealing the data.","However, it remains critical that advertisers use this data carefully. The stakes will likely be higher for any future violations of users’ trust.","Advertisers will also want to ensure they inform users about how they collect and store data.","When CA first started collecting data, they were not technically violating any laws or Facebook terms. As advertisers, it is our responsibility to step back and think about whether we are violating the privacy of our users, regardless of the legality of our actions. Even if an advertiser action is legal at the time it took place—like the CA data collection method—the advertiser will ultimately be held responsible in the court of public opinion.","*Disclaimer: The information in this blogpost is based solely on the reporting by Channel 4, The Guardian, and NYTimes.com.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2IBKHco?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.83336ceeabc5","title":"U.S. and European officials question Facebook’s protection of personal data - The Washington Post","text":["U.S. and European officials on Sunday called for Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how personal information about tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm that worked for President Trump’s 2016 campaign — without the permission or knowledge of the vast majority of those affected.","News reports about Facebook’s role in the aggressive form of data collection also have raised serious questions about whether the company violated a landmark consent decree with a federal watchdog agency designed to prevent privacy violations. Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Late Friday evening, Facebook announced it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and associated researchers.","Update: On Monday, Facebook announced the hire of a digital forensics firm “to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”","The Times called it one “one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.” But Facebook rejected that claim as “completely false” because the data was obtained by misleading the company and its users rather than by infiltrating its security systems. Facebook may be overestimating the importance of semantics to investors; the share price of the company was $171 Monday morning, down from $185 Friday.","Alarm over the leak isn’t limited to Facebook’s shareholders. Maura Healy, the attorney general of Massachusetts, is opening an investigation into the matter. The Congressional Democrats leading investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election also called for inquiries into the Cambridge Analytica incident, the Times reports.","Update: Outcry from Washington, D.C. grew louder Monday with additional lawmakers demanding answers from Facebook. In a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said, “the ease with which Cambridge Analytica was able to exploit Facebook’s default privacy settings for profit and political gain” raises serious questions about “Facebook’s business practices and the dangers of monetizing consumers’ private information.”","Cambridge Analytica was officially formed by former Trump advisor Steve Bannon with a $15 million investment from Republican mega-donor Robert Mercer. The goal was to leverage tactics originating at Cambridge University that claimed to predict personality traits and behavior through a process called “psychographic mapping.” Cambridge Analytica hired Russian-American psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan to secure the underlying data necessary to conduct this kind of mapping, which helps campaigns target specific groups.","Kogan created an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which offered Facebook users small payments if they downloaded it and took a personality quiz. About 270,000 people signed up, Facebook says. The app scraped private information from those 270,000 Facebook profiles, including data from 50 million of their unwitting Facebook friends. Facebook says that it removed Kogan’s app and demanded the data be destroyed in 2015 when the company learned that user information had been passed along to political operatives. But not all copies of the data have been destroyed, according to The Times.","The Cambridge Analytica news is the latest in a series of political scandals that have rattled Facebook and incurred the ire of lawmakers. The company is also under scrutiny for facilitating Russian interference in the 2016 election and spreading disinformation, hate speech, and other toxic content. Zuckerberg has even made fixing Facebook his “personal mission” for 2018.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook said in a statement. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","Monica Nickelsburg is GeekWire’s Civic Innovation Editor, covering technology-driven solutions to urban challenges and the intersection of tech and politics.

We have also now ensured that consultants cannot view encrypted data, so there is no risk to clients whatsoever,\" it said.","Responding to an article published on Fin24 quoting a Durban software expert, Afrihost also said its passwords are not stored in plain text, but are encrypted. See original article below.","The information only related to ADSL usernames and passwords, it said. \"At absolute worst, the information in question could only be used to login to an ADSL account (and one that allows concurrent logins).\"","\"Any client could still view their ADSL sessions via their ClientZone and request any unknown numbers be blocked from accessing their account. There would be zero possibility that these details could ever lead to obtaining payment or personal information.\"","Afrihost also questioned the credentials of the expert and said Taylor Gibb, the software developer that revelead the flaw, had been banned from the Afrihost network two years ago.","\"The fact is that Taylor Gibb had previously tried to publicly attack our brand on minor technical issues, and was ultimately fired as client for breach of our terms,\"said Afrihost CEO Gian Visser.","Johannesburg - Internet service provider Afrihost says it has solved a massive security flaw that left the ADSL credentials of every single user vulnerable. However, a Durban software expert disagrees.","Software and security expert Taylor Gibb recently posted on Facebook that Afrihost staff had been able to provide ADSL account credentials to users over the phone, leaving information at risk.","An asymmetric digital subscriber line, or ADSL, allows for the fast transfer of data commonly used in households to access the internet","Afrihost, however, told Fin24 on Monday that the ADSL credentials had been encrypted.

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work — including a former Cambridge Analytica employee — said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what “like” buttons they had hit.","“In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,” the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook’s concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump’s digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user- ­experience researcher, according to Facebook’s public website.","Some critics said Facebook’s actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump’s campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Cambridge Analytica — which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president’s former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon — has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its “psychometric profiles” could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company’s actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain’s information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data “may have been illegally acquired and used.”","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. “It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 E.U. referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee that is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.E.U., a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook’s processes for dealing with developers who broke the company’s rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules — usually because of a story in the news — the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook “relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,” Parakilas said. “During my 16 months at the company, I don’t recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.”","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","“Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,” said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook’s actions on Saturday, including if it ran afoul of its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of its agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry into U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge’s “psychographic targeting” techniques — including its use of Facebook data — with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of Cambridge’s work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers’ likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge’s work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm’s data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign’s data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump’s strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge’s parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in “soft power,” or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO’s Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia’s influence in the region.","SCL’s main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience’s values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of “persuadables,” and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL’s defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company’s techniques is that it “can be undertaken covertly.”","“Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government’s role and/or third parties can be invisible,” he wrote.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"","\"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\"","The Guardian reported Sunday that at 17, Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the opposition, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion.","A senior source with the Liberal party says Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission.","Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modelling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","\"This was a scam — and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used.\"","In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\" Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\"","Reading voters' minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Nix, a brash salesperson, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behaviour and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win.","When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email.","\"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote.","Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behaviour.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","An international effort","Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country.

Thom Tillis, R-N.C.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \"personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\" Nix \"never had any strategic or operational role\" in a U.S. election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company's U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees' roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","After the leak","By early 2015, Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company.

In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \"carefully investigating this situation\" and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \"This data was obtained and used without permission,\" said a letter that was obtained by The New York Times. \"It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\"","Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Kogan and \"SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\"","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook's control.

This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The New York Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica's political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump's re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a \"Math Man,\" he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on.","Cambridge Analytica used personality quiz app to harvest social media data from over 50 million users, most without consent.","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 U.S. midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"","\"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\"","The Guardian reported Sunday that at 17, Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the opposition, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion.","A senior source with the Liberal party says Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission.","Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modelling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","\"This was a scam — and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used.\"","In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\" Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\"","Reading voters' minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Nix, a brash salesperson, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behaviour and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win.","When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email.","\"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote.","Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behaviour.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","An international effort","Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen.

But, he said, advertising for the speech had added to the value of his brand. He believed that with the value of that publicity included, the true payment for the speech was more than $1 million.","He didn’t own the building. Somebody else did. Trump had agreed to let his name be used on the building. But, Trump said, this licensing deal was so advantageous to him that it was “a form of ownership.”","This was published in Trump's book \"How to Get Rich” Trump uses this figure to make his comeback seem even more impressive. But his debt was never that high. Trump shifted the blame, saying co-author Meredith McIver put the number in.","Trump acknowledged the actual value of units sold was $956 million but said the units he was “not actively selling,” and keeping as an investment, brought the total to $1.3 billion. Trump's falsehoods often include specific numbers, making them easily disprovable.","Even though at least two banks estimated his net worth to be much lower, Trump contended that they must have missed or discounted assets.","The memberships to this golf club were being sold for $200,000. Trump said he arrived at the higher number by including yearly fees that members had to pay after joining.","Trump was keeping a number of units for himself. The lawyer estimated that closer to three-quarters of the units had been sold. Trump's response was \"What would you like me to say, 'Oh, gee, the building is not doing well, blah, blah, blah, come by the building’? Nobody talks that way. Who would ever talk that way?\"","In an internal document, Trump had valued the property at $366 million. “I guess some people would say that was the value and other people would say maybe not,” Trump said when asked about the discrepancy.","Trump was touting that higher value, but he had not made any significant effort to build the homes that the value was based on. “I don't have a plan to build homes, because I don't want to build homes,” he said.","Property records indicated it was $1.4 million.","Internal documents from the same period put his net worth around $3.5 billion.

Trump insisted that the word “small” was incorrect. Trump continued reading: “I wrote, ‘Is 50 percent small?’ ”","“This [note] was intended to indicate that you had a 50 percent stake in the project, correct?” said the lawyer.","“That’s correct,” Trump said.","For the first of many times that day, Trump was about to be caught saying something that wasn’t true.",".","LAWYER: Mr. Trump, do you own 30 percent or 50 percent of the limited partnership?","TRUMP: I own 30 percent.","It was a mid-December morning in 2007 — the start of an interrogation unlike anything else in the public record of Trump’s life.","Trump had brought it on himself. He had sued a reporter, accusing him of being reckless and dishonest in a book that raised questions about Trump’s net worth. The reporter’s attorneys turned the tables and brought Trump in for a deposition.","For two straight days, they asked Trump question after question that touched on the same theme: Trump’s honesty.","The lawyers confronted the mogul with his past statements — and with his company’s internal documents, which often showed those statements had been incorrect or invented. The lawyers were relentless. Trump, the bigger-than-life mogul, was vulnerable — cornered, out-prepared and under oath.","Thirty times, they caught him.","Trump had misstated sales at his condo buildings. Inflated the price of membership at one of his golf clubs. Overstated the depth of his past debts and the number of his employees.","That deposition — 170 transcribed pages — offers extraordinary insights into Trump’s relationship with the truth. Trump’s falsehoods were unstrategic — needless, highly specific, easy to disprove. When caught, Trump sometimes blamed others for the error or explained that the untrue thing really was true, in his mind, because he saw the situation more positively than others did.","“Have you ever lied in public statements about your properties?” the lawyer asked.","“I try and be truthful,” Trump said. “I’m no different from a politician running for office. You always want to put the best foot forward.”","In his presidential campaign, Trump has sought to make his truth-telling a selling point. He nicknamed his main Republican opponent “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz. He called his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, “A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR!” in a recent Twitter message. “I will present the facts plainly and honestly,” he said in the opening of his speech at the Republican National Convention. “We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.”","Trump has had a habit of telling demonstrable untruths during his presidential campaign. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker has awarded him four Pinocchios — the maximum a statement can receive — 39 times since he announced his bid last summer. In many cases, his statements echo those in the 2007 deposition: They are specific, checkable — and wrong.","Trump said he opposed the Iraq War at the start. He didn’t. He said he’d never mocked a disabled New York Times reporter. He had. Trump also said the National Football League had sent him a letter, objecting to a presidential debate that was scheduled for the same time as a football game. It hadn’t.","Last week, Trump claimed that he had seen footage — taken at a top-secret location and released by the Iranian government — showing a plane unloading a large amount of cash to Iran from the U.S. government. He hadn’t. Trump later conceded he’d been mistaken — he’d seen TV news video that showed a plane during a prisoner release.","But, even under the spotlight of this campaign, Trump has never had an experience quite like this deposition on Dec. 19 and 20, 2007.","He was trapped in a room — with his own prior statements and three high-powered lawyers.","“A very clear and visible side effect of my lawyers’ questioning of Trump is that he [was revealed as] a routine and habitual fabulist,” said Timothy L. O’Brien, the author Trump had sued.","The Washington Post sent the Trump campaign a detailed list of questions about this deposition, listing all the times when Trump seemed to have been caught in a false or unsupported statement. The Post asked Trump whether he wanted to challenge any of those findings — and whether he had felt regret when confronted with them.","In 2005, O’Brien, then a reporter for the New York Times, had published a book called “Trump Nation: The Art of Being the Donald.” In the book, O’Brien cited people who questioned a claim at the bedrock of Trump’s identity — that his net worth was more than $5 billion. O’Brien said he had spoken to three people who estimated that the figure was between $150 million and $250 million.","Trump sued. He later told The Post that he intended to hurt O’Brien, whom he called a “lowlife sleazebag.”","“I didn’t read [the book], to be honest with you. . . . I never read it. I saw some of the things they said,” Trump said later. “I said: ‘Go sue him. It will cost him a lot of money.’ ”","By filing suit, Trump hadn’t just opened himself up to questioning — he had opened a door into the opaque and secretive company he ran.","O’Brien’s attorneys included Mary Jo White, now the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Andrew Ceresney, now the SEC’s director of enforcement. The lawsuit had given them the power to request that Trump turn over internal company documents, and they used it. They arrived at the deposition having already identified where Trump’s public statements hadn’t matched the private truth.","The questions began with that handwritten note and the 50 percent stake that wasn’t 50 percent.","“The 30 percent equates to much more than 30 percent,” Trump explained. His reasoning was that he had not been required to put up money at the outset, so his 30 percent share seemed more valuable.","“Are you saying that the real estate community would interpret your interest to be 50 percent, even though in limited partnership agreements it’s 30 percent?” Ceresney asked.","“Smart people would,” Trump said.","“Smart people?”","“Smart people would say it’s much more than 30 percent.”","Trump inflates the numbers","TRUMP: I got more than a million dollars, because they have tremendous promotion expenses, to my advantage. In other words, they promote, which has great value, through billboards, through newspapers, through radio, I think through television – yeah, through television.","And they spend – again, I’d have to ask them, but I bet they spend at least a million or two million or maybe even more than that on promoting Donald Trump.","LAWYER: But how much of the payments were cash?","TRUMP: Approximately $400,000.","LAWYER: So when you say publicly that you got paid more than a million dollars, you’re including in that sum the promotional expenses that they pay?","TRUMP: Oh, absolutely, yes. That has a great value. It has a great value to me.","LAWYER: Do you actually say that when you say you got paid more than a million dollars publicly?","TRUMP: I don’t break it down.","On to the next one.","“I was paid more than a million dollars,” Trump said when Ceresney asked how much he’d been paid for a speech in 2005 at New York City’s Learning Annex, a continuing-education center.","Ceresney was ready.","“But how much of the payments were cash?”","“Approximately $400,000,” Trump said.","Trump said his personal math included the intangible value of publicity: The Learning Annex had advertised his speech heavily, and Trump thought that helped his brand. Therefore, in his mind he’d been paid more than $1 million, even though his actual payment was $400,000.","“Do you actually say that, when you say you got a million dollars publicly?” Ceresney asked.","“I don’t break it down,” Trump said.","As the deposition went on, the lawyers led Trump through case after case in which he’d overstated his success.","Donald Trump, right, is interviewed by Larry King during a taping of \"Larry King Live\" on Oct., 7, 1999.

He said he was counting employees of other companies that acted as suppliers and subcontractors to his businesses.","Another one. In O’Brien’s book, Trump had been quoted saying: “I had zero borrowings from [my father’s] estate. . . . I give you my word.”","Under oath:","“Mr. Trump, have you ever borrowed money from your father’s estate?”","“I think a small amount a long time ago,” Trump said. “I think it was like in the $9 million range.”","Another one. In one of his own books, Trump had said about one of his golf courses: “Membership costs $300,000. I think it’s a bargain.”","Under oath:","“In fact, your memberships were not selling at $300,000 at that time, correct?”","“We’ve sold many for two hundred” thousand, Trump said. Then, Trump pushed it upward: “We’ve sold many for, I think, two-fifty.”","But this was not the place to push it.","The lawyer had an internal Trump document that showed the true figure — “$200,000 per membership,” Ceresney said.","“Correct,” Trump acknowledged. “Right.”","Trump passes the blame","LAWYER: You didn’t correct it when you read the book?","TRUMP: Well, I did correct it, and she didn’t correct it.","But you could have her in as a witness, and I’m sure we’ll bring her in as a witness because what she wrote was — I asked her to change it to “billions of dollars in debt,” and she probably forgot.","LAWYER: And when you read it, you didn’t correct it?","TRUMP: I didn’t see it.","LAWYER: You didn’t see it.","TRUMP: I read it very quickly. I didn’t see it. I would have corrected it, but I didn’t see it.","In some cases, Trump acknowledged he was wrong — but not that he was at fault. Instead, he sought to turn the blame on others.","“This is somebody that wrote it, probably Meredith McIver,” Trump said at one point when confronted with another false statement. “That is a mistake.”","McIver, a staff writer with the Trump Organization, blazed into the public eye last month for having inserted plagiarized material — taken from Michelle Obama’s 2008 convention speech — in the convention speech of Trump’s wife, Melania. McIver said it had been an innocent mistake.","But in this deposition more than eight years earlier, Trump was blaming her for a mistake in one of his own books, “How to Get Rich.” In the 2004 book, co-written with McIver, Trump described his massive debt load during a low period in the early 1990s. “I owed billions upon billions of dollars — $9.2 billion to be exact,” the book said as it retold the story of his rise back to success.","Trump signs copies of his new book \"How to Get Rich\" in New York in 2004.

His actual debts had been much less.","“I pointed it out to the person who wrote the book,” Trump said, meaning McIver.","“Right after she wrote the book?”","“That’s correct,” Trump said.","Then the lawyer showed Trump another book he’d written with McIver, three years later.","“In fact, I was $9 billion in debt,” Trump read aloud.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)","The news that Facebook's Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant. But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place?","Share story","The news that Facebook’s Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant. But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place?","The short answer: Because Google let it. The longer answer: Well, it’s complicated.","The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google’s Android system in 2015 — first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn’t collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings.","Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics. The kerfuffle over this data collection, first reported by the website Ars Technica , follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence elections.","There’s a reason Facebook’s actions were restricted to Android phones. Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. “Apple’s fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,” said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.","But Android has long been more indulgent.","Until recently, in fact, Google let app developers gain access to a phone’s call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.","Starting in 2012 with its “Jelly Bean” release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs, but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn’t work.","It wasn’t until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed “Marshmallow,” that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.","That’s the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren’t using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can’t get it even if they want it.","Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.","There are nearly 20,000 Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.","As of January, about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as “Oreo.” (Many of them are owners of Google’s new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)","Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.","All that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?","Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google’s advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.","Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple’s App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did.","Experts say it’s not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it’s very possible.","“In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,” said Bob O’Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. “There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.”","It is unclear how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users’ call logs had been sent to app developers. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.","One major Android phone maker expressed uncertainty over its role in protecting user privacy. “At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,” LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.","___","AP Technology Writer Youkyung Lee in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years’ worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received,” the news outlet reported. “This experience has been shared by a number of other Facebook users who spoke with Ars, as well as independently by us — my own Facebook data archive, I found, contained call-log data for a certain Android device I used in 2015 and 2016, along with SMS and MMS message metadata.”","Following the report, Facebook attempted to ease concerns from its users in a blog post, Sunday, where the company claimed news reports had been inaccurate.","“You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,” claimed Facebook. “Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature.”","However, despite Facebook’s claims that users had to explicitly opt-in to the data collecting, Ars Technica noted that in several cases users had not.","“This contradicts the experience of several users who shared their data with Ars. Dylan McKay told Ars that he installed Messenger in 2015, but only allowed the app the permissions in the Android manifest that were required for installation,” Ars Technica explained. “He says he removed and reinstalled the app several times over the course of the next few years, but never explicitly gave the app permission to read his SMS records and call history.”","“In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used. Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data,” they added. “Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications. While data collection was technically ‘opt-in,’ in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook’s application, not a separate notification of data collection.”","Twitter users and celebrities threatened to boycott Facebook and delete their accounts in response to allegations of user data mishandling last week, which one former employee claimed was “horrifying” and routine at Facebook.","“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” declared Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg response. “This was a major breach of trust, and I’m really sorry that this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect peoples’ data.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

So it’s no wonder investors and entrepreneurs are optimistic about the potential of data to form a new competitive advantage. Some have even hailed data as “the new oil.” We invest exclusively in startups leveraging data and AI to solve business problems, so we certainly see the appeal — but the oil analogy is flawed.","In all the enthusiasm for big data, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that all data is not created equal. Startups and large corporations alike boast about the volume of data they’ve amassed, ranging from terabytes of data to quantities surpassing all of the information contained in the Library of Congress. Quantity alone does not make a “data moat.”","Firstly, raw data is not nearly as valuable as data employed to solve a problem. We see this in the public markets: companies that serve as aggregators and merchants of data, such as Nielsen and Acxiom, sustain much lower valuation multiples than companies that build products powered by data in combination with algorithms and ML, such as Netflix or Facebook. The current generation of AI startups recognize this difference and apply machine learning models to extract value from the data they collect.","Even when data is put to work powering ML-based solutions, the size of the data set is only one part of the story. The value of a data set, the strength of a data moat, comes from context. Some applications require models to be trained to a high degree of accuracy before they can provide any value to a customer, while others need little or no data at all. Some data sets are truly proprietary, others are readily duplicated. Some data decays in value over time, while other data sets are evergreen. The application determines the value of the data.","Defining the “data appetite”","Machine learning applications can require widely different amounts of data to provide valuable features to the end user.","MAP threshold","In the cloud era, the idea of the minimum viable product (or MVP) has taken hold — that collection of software features which has just enough value to seek initial customers. In the intelligence era, we see the analog emerging for data and models: the minimum level of accurate intelligence required to justify adoption. We call this the minimum algorithmic performance (MAP).","Most applications don’t require 100 percent accuracy to create value. For example, a productivity tool for doctors might initially streamline data entry into electronic health record systems, but over time could automate data entry by learning from what doctors enter in the system. In this case, the MAP is zero, because the application has value from day one based on software features alone. Intelligence can be added later. However, solutions where AI is central to the product (for example, a tool to identify strokes from CT scans), would likely need to equal the accuracy of status quo (human-based) solutions. In this case the MAP is to match the performance of human radiologists, and an immense volume of data might be needed before a commercial launch is viable.","Performance threshold","Not every problem can be solved with near 100 percent accuracy. Some problems are too complex to fully model given the current state of the art; in that case, volume of data won’t be a silver bullet. Adding data might incrementally improve the model’s performance, but quickly hit diminishing marginal returns.","At the other extreme, some problems can be solved with near 100 percent accuracy with a very small training set, because the problem being modeled is relatively simple, with few dimensions to track and few variations in outcome.","In short, the amount of data you need to effectively solve a problem varies widely. We call the amount of training data needed to reach viable levels of accuracy the performance threshold.","AI-powered contract processing is a good example of an application with a low performance threshold. There are thousands of contract types, but most of them share key fields: the parties involved, the items of value being exchanged, time frame, etc. Specific document types like mortgage applications or rental agreements are highly standardized in order to comply with regulation. Across multiple startups, we’ve seen algorithms that automatically process documents needing only a few hundred examples to train to an acceptable degree of accuracy.","Entrepreneurs need to thread a needle. If the performance threshold is high, you’ll have a bootstrap problem acquiring enough data to create a product to drive customer usage and more data collection. Too low, and you haven’t built much of a data moat!","Stability threshold","Machine learning models train on examples taken from the real-world environment they represent. If conditions change over time, gradually or suddenly, and the model doesn’t change with it, the model will decay. In other words, the model’s predictions will no longer be reliable.","For example, Constructor.io is a startup that uses machine learning to rank search results for e-commerce websites. The system observes customer clicks on search results and uses that data to predict the best order for future search results. But e-commerce product catalogs are constantly changing. A model that weighs all clicks equally, or trained only on a data set from one period of time, risks overvaluing older products at the expense of newly introduced and currently popular products.","Keeping the model stable requires ingesting fresh training data at the same rate that the environment changes. We call this rate of data acquisition the stability threshold.","Perishable data doesn’t make for a very good data moat. On the other hand, ongoing access to abundant fresh data can be a formidable barrier to entry when the stability threshold is low.","Identifying opportunities with long-term defensibility","The MAP, performance threshold and stability threshold are all central elements to identifying strong data moats.","First-movers may have a low MAP to enter a new category, but once they have created a category and lead it, the minimum bar for future entrants is to equal or exceed the first mover.","Domains requiring less data to reach the performance threshold and less data to maintain that performance (the stability threshold) are not very defensible. New entrants can readily amass enough data and match or leapfrog your solution. On the other hand, companies attacking problems with low performance threshold (don’t require too much data) and a low stability threshold (data decays rapidly) could still build a moat by acquiring new data faster than the competition.","More elements of a strong data moat","AI investors talk enthusiastically about “public data” versus “proprietary data” to classify data sets, but the strength of a data moat has more dimensions, including:","Accessibility","Time — how quickly can the data be amassed and used in the model? Can the data be accessed instantly, or does it take a significant amount of time to obtain and process?","Cost — how much money is needed to acquire this data? Does the user of the data need to pay for licensing rights or pay humans to label the data?","Uniqueness — is similar data widely available to others who could then build a model and achieve the same result? Such so-called proprietary data might better be termed “commodity data” — for example: job listings, widely available document types (like NDAs or loan applications), images of human faces.","Dimensionality — how many different attributes are described in a data set? Are many of them relevant to solving the problem?","Breadth — how widely do the values of attributes vary? Does the data set account for edge cases and rare exceptions? Can data or learnings be pooled across customers to provide greater breadth of coverage than data from just one customer?","Perishability — how broadly applicable over time is this data? Is a model trained from this data durable over a long time period, or does it need regular updates?","Virtuous loop — can outcomes such as performance feedback or predictive accuracy be used as inputs to improve the algorithm? Can performance compound over time?","Software is now a commodity, making data moats more important than ever for companies to build a long-term competitive advantage. With tech titans democratizing access to AI toolkits to attract cloud computing customers, data sets are one of the most important ways to differentiate. A truly defensible data moat doesn’t come from just amassing the largest volume of data. The best data moats are tied to a particular problem domain, in which unique, fresh, data compounds in value as it solves problems for customers."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand.","Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network.","He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them.","“Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it.","“Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.”","Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland.","(NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.)","The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges.","The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results).","And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value.","“We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on.","“Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.”","He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account.","So, er, ouch.","In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner as, er, hostile to privacy…","A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement:","We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further.","This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions.","Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!).","The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning.","Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook.","Downloaded FB data also gives you insight into whom else has data on you (used to run custom audiences). Have never engaged with 75% of these… pic.twitter.com/dQPjIcI8CW","Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period.","“I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.”","Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot.","But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users.","“They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.”","“Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large.","“It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?”","“They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks.

{"originalurl":"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/10/hard-questions-russian-ads-delivered-to-congress/","title":"Hard Questions: Russian Ads Delivered to Congress | Facebook Newsroom","text":["Hard Questions: Russian Ads Delivered to Congress","Update on October 6, 2017: This post has been combined with an earlier post on this topic to create a single page of information about the ads we discovered. We’ll continue to add updates here.","What was in the ads you shared with Congress? How many people saw them?\nMost of the ads appear to focus on divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights. A number of them appear to encourage people to follow Pages on these issues.","Here are a few other facts about the ads:","An estimated 10 million people in the US saw the ads. We were able to approximate the number of unique people (“reach”) who saw at least one of these ads, with our best modeling","44% of total ad impressions (number of times ads were displayed) were before the US election on November 8, 2016; 56% were after the election.","Roughly 25% of the ads were never shown to anyone. That’s because advertising auctions are designed so that ads reach people based on relevance, and certain ads may not reach anyone as a result.","For 50% of the ads, less than $3 was spent; for 99% of the ads, less than $1,000 was spent.","About 1% of the ads used a specific type of Custom Audiences targeting to reach people on Facebook who had visited that advertiser’s website or liked the advertiser’s Page — as well as to reach people who are similar to those audiences. None of the ads used another type of Custom Audiences targeting based on personal information such as email addresses. (This bullet added October 3, 2017.)","Of the more than 3,000 ads that we have shared with Congress, 5% appeared on Instagram. About $6,700 was spent on these ads (This bullet added October 6, 2017.)","Why do you allow ads like these to target certain demographic or interest groups?\nOur ad targeting is designed to show people ads they might find useful, instead of showing everyone ads that they might find irrelevant or annoying. For instance, a baseball clothing line can use our targeting categories to reach people just interested in baseball, rather than everyone who likes sports. Other examples include a business selling makeup designed specifically for African-American women. Or a language class wanting to reach potential students.","These are worthwhile uses of ad targeting because they enable people to connect with the things they care about. But we know ad targeting can be abused, and we aim to prevent abusive ads from running on our platform. To begin, ads containing certain types of targeting will now require additional human review and approval.","In looking for such abuses, we examine all of the components of an ad: who created it, who it’s intended for, and what its message is. Sometimes a combination of an ad’s message and its targeting can be pernicious. If we find any ad — including those targeting a cultural affinity interest group — that contains a message spreading hate or violence, it will be rejected or removed. Facebook’s Community Standards strictly prohibit attacking people based on their protected characteristics, and our advertising terms are even more restrictive, prohibiting advertisers from discriminating against people based on religion and other attributes.","Why can’t you catch every ad that breaks your rules?\nWe review millions of ads each week, and about 8 million people report ads to us each day. In the last year alone, we have significantly grown the number of people working on ad review. And in order to do better at catching abuse on our platform, we’re announcing a number of improvements, including:","Making advertising more transparent","Strengthening enforcement against improper ads","Tightening restrictions on advertiser content","Increasing requirements for authenticity","Establishing industry standards and best practices","Weren’t some of these ads paid for in Russian currency? Why didn’t your ad review system notice this and bring the ads to your attention?\nSome of the ads were paid for in Russian currency. Currency alone isn’t a good way of identifying suspicious activity, because the overwhelming majority of advertisers who pay in Russian currency, like the overwhelming majority of people who access Facebook from Russia, aren’t doing anything wrong. We did use this as a signal to help identify these ads, but it wasn’t the only signal. We are continuing to refine our techniques for identifying the kinds of ads in question. We’re not going to disclose more details because we don’t want to give bad actors a roadmap for avoiding future detection.","If the ads had been purchased by Americans instead of Russians, would they have violated your policies?\nWe require authenticity regardless of location. If Americans conducted a coordinated, inauthentic operation — as the Russian organization did in this case — we would take their ads down, too.","However, many of these ads did not violate our content policies. That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.","Shouldn’t you stop foreigners from meddling in US social issues?The right to speak out on global issues that cross borders is an important principle. Organizations such as UNICEF, Oxfam or religious organizations depend on the ability to communicate — and advertise — their views in a wide range of countries. While we may not always agree with the positions of those who would speak on issues here, we believe in their right to do so — just as we believe in the right of Americans to express opinions on issues in other countries.","Some of these ads and other content on Facebook appear to sow division in America and other countries at a time of increasing social unrest. If these ads or content were placed or posted authentically, you would allow many of these. Why?\nThis is an issue we have debated a great deal. We understand that Facebook has become an important platform for social and political expression in the US and around the world. We are focused on developing greater safeguards against malicious interference in elections and strengthening our advertising policies and enforcement to prevent abuse.","As an increasingly important and widespread platform for political and social expression, we at Facebook — and all of us — must also take seriously the crucial place that free political speech occupies around the world in protecting democracy and the rights of those who are in the minority, who are oppressed or who have views that are not held by the majority or those in power. Even when we have taken all steps to control abuse, there will be political and social content that will appear on our platform that people will find objectionable, and that we will find objectionable. We permit these messages because we share the values of free speech — that when the right to speech is censored or restricted for any of us, it diminishes the rights to speech for all of us, and that when people have the right and opportunity to engage in free and full political expression, over time, they will move forward, not backwards, in promoting democracy and the rights of all.","Are you working with other companies and the government to prevent interference that exploits platforms like yours?\nThe threats we’re confronting are bigger than any one company, or even any one industry. The kind of malicious interference we’re seeing requires everyone working together, across business, government and civil society, to share information and arrive at the best responses.","We have been working with many others in the technology industry, including with Google and Twitter, on a range of elements related to this investigation. We also have a long history of working together to fight online threats and develop best practices on other issues, such as child safety and counterterrorism. And we will continue all of this work.","With all these new efforts you’re putting in place, would any of them have prevented these ads from running?\nWe believe we would have caught these malicious actors faster and prevented more improper ads from running. Our effort to require US election-related advertisers to authenticate their business will help catch suspicious behavior. The ad transparency tool we’re building will be accessible to anyone, including industry and political watchdog groups. And our improved enforcement and more restrictive content standards for ads would have rejected more of the ads when submitted.","Is there more out there that you haven’t found?\nIt’s possible. We’re still looking for abuse and bad actors on our platform — our internal investigation continues. We hope that by cooperating with Congress, the special counsel and our industry partners, we will help keep bad actors off our platform.","Do you now have a complete view of what happened in this election?\nThe 2016 US election was the first where evidence has been widely reported that foreign actors sought to exploit the internet to influence voter behavior. We understand more about how our service was abused and we will continue to investigate to learn all we can. We know that our experience is only a small piece of a much larger puzzle. Congress and the special counsel are best placed to put these pieces together because they have much broader investigative power to obtain information from other sources.","We strongly believe in free and fair elections. We strongly believe in free speech and robust public debate. We strongly believe free speech and free elections depend upon each other. We’re fast developing both standards and greater safeguards against malicious and illegal interference on our platform. We’re strengthening our advertising policies to minimize and even eliminate abuse. Why? Because we are mindful of the importance and special place political speech occupies in protecting both democracy and civil society. We are dedicated to being an open platform for all ideas — and that may sometimes mean allowing people to express views we — or others — find objectionable. This has been the longstanding challenge for all democracies: how to foster honest and authentic political speech while protecting civic discourse from manipulation and abuse. Now that the challenge has taken a new shape, it will be up to all of us to meet it.","Update on October 8, 2017:","Did you have someone embedded within the Trump campaign?\nWe offered identical support to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns, and had teams assigned to both. Everyone had access to the same tools, which are the same tools that every campaign is offered.","The campaigns did not get to “hand pick” the people who worked with them from Facebook. And no one from Facebook was assigned full-time to the Trump campaign, or full-time to the Clinton campaign. Both campaigns approached things differently and used different amounts of support.","—","Originally published on September 21, 2017:","Hard Questions: More on Russian Ads","As our General Counsel has explained, this is an extraordinary investigation — one that raises questions that go to the integrity of the US elections. After an extensive legal and policy review, we’ve concluded that sharing the ads we’ve discovered with Congress, in a manner that is consistent with our obligations to protect user information, will help government authorities complete the vitally important work of assessing what happened in the 2016 election. That is an assessment that can be made only by investigators with access to classified intelligence and information from all relevant companies and industries — and we want to do our part. Congress is best placed to use the information we and others provide to inform the public comprehensively and completely.","2) Why are you sharing these with special counsel and Congress — and not releasing them to the public?","Federal law places strict limitations on the disclosure of account information. Given the sensitive national security and privacy issues involved in this extraordinary investigation, we think Congress is best placed to use the information we and others provide to inform the public comprehensively and completely. For further understanding on this decision, see our General Counsel’s post.","3) Let’s go back to the beginning. Did Facebook know when the ads were purchased that they might be part of a Russian operation? Why not?","No, we didn’t.","The vast majority of our over 5 million advertisers use our self-service tools. This allows individuals or businesses to create a Facebook Page, attach a credit card or some other payment method and run ads promoting their posts.","In some situations, Facebook employees work directly with our larger advertisers. In the case of the Russian ads, none of those we found involved in-person relationships.","At the same time, a significant number of advertisers run ads internationally, and a high number of advertisers run content that addresses social issues — an ad from a non-governmental organization, for example, that addresses women’s rights. So there was nothing necessarily noteworthy at the time about a foreign actor running an ad involving a social issue. Of course, knowing what we’ve learned since the election, some of these ads were indeed both noteworthy and problematic, which is why our CEO today announced a number of important steps we are taking to help prevent this kind of deceptive interference in the future.","4) Do you expect to find more ads from Russian or other foreign actors using fake accounts?","It’s possible.","When we’re looking for this type of abuse, we cast a wide net in trying to identify any activity that looks suspicious. But it’s a game of cat and mouse. Bad actors are always working to use more sophisticated methods to obfuscate their origins and cover their tracks. That in turn leads us to devise new methods and smarter tactics to catch them — things like machine learning, data science and highly trained human investigators. And, of course, our internal inquiry continues.","It’s possible that government investigators have information that could help us, and we welcome any information the authorities are willing to share to help with our own investigations.","Using ads and other messaging to affect political discourse has become a common part of the cybersecurity arsenal for organized, advanced actors. This means all online platforms will need to address this issue, and get smarter about how to address it, now and in the future.","5) I’ve heard that Facebook disabled tens of thousands of accounts in France and only hundreds in the United States. Is this accurate?","No, these numbers represent different things and can’t be directly compared.","To explain it, it’s important to understand how large platforms try to stop abusive behavior at scale. Staying ahead of those who try to misuse our service is an ongoing effort led by our security and integrity teams, and we recognize this work will never be done. We build and update technical systems every day to make it easier to respond to reports of abuse, detect and remove spam, identify and eliminate fake accounts, and prevent accounts from being compromised. This work also reduces the distribution of content that violates our policies, since fake accounts often distribute deceptive material, such as false news, hoaxes, and misinformation.","This past April, we announced improvements to these systems aimed at helping us detect fake accounts on our service more effectively. As we began to roll out these changes globally, we took action against tens of thousands of fake accounts in France. This number represents fake accounts of all varieties, the most common being those that are used for financially-motivated spam. While we believe that the removal of these accounts also reduced the spread of disinformation, it’s incorrect to state that these tens of thousands of accounts represent organized campaigns from any particular country or set of countries.","In contrast, the approximately 470 accounts and Pages we shut down recently were identified by our dedicated security team that manually investigates specific, organized threats. They found that this set of accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another — and were likely operated out of Russia.","Read more about our new blog series Hard Questions.

The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.","Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","What kind of information was collected, and how was it acquired?","The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.","Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.","The technique had been developed at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.","Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.","Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge.","So was Facebook hacked?","Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.","But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.","Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","What is Facebook doing in response?","The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.","Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.”","What are others saying?","Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.","■ In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook’s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.","■ A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook’s ties to Cambridge Analytica.","■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post.

He had pushed for investigations and disclosures, sources said, much to the \"consternation\" of top staff.","Stamos said he planned to leave in December after his duties were assigned to others, according to tipsters, but Facebook convinced him to stay for several months both to ease the transition and to preserve the social network's image.

He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that.","But Chris Hoofnagle, faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, said that legal language in the consent decree would make it difficult for the government to show that Facebook had violated the agreement, because it allows Facebook to give the information of a user’s friends to third-party developers.","“The consent decree doesn’t give the FTC a lot of traction, but what’s going to happen is what happened in the first FTC case,” Hoofnagle said, referring to the investigation that resulted in the 2011 agreement. “The FTC went in investigating A, then discovered B, C, D, E, F and G. The same thing is going to happen here. They’re going to go in under the consent decree logic, and then they’re going to find other wrongdoing.”","Facebook is also facing questions over reports that it collected years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and information about text messages from Android users.","Facebook said on Sunday that this information was uploaded to secure servers and came only from people who gave explicit consent to allow it.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Officials said the data was not sold or shared with users’ friends or outside apps.

Taken together, these two developments frame the debate about privacy. Until now, the big data harvesting companies have approached their obligations to the people who supply their personal data much in the spirit of the Vogon demolition fleet in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, when Arthur Dent protests that the annihilation of the Earth has come without any warning: “But the plans were on display … on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard’.”","The new bill, modelled very closely on the EU’s corresponding regulation, promises to change all this. The idea is to establish very clearly that personal data can only be used for purposes for which informed consent has been given by the owners. The question – in the spirit of another Leopard – is whether everything will change so that everything can stay the same. How far can privacy be maintained in an economy that depends on the exploitation of personal data? By engaging with Facebook or Google at all, we give up far more information than we realise, in part because of the way in which data becomes more valuable the more of it is collected. Facebook, for example, can make a very good guess at a user’s sexual orientation on the basis of only four “likes”. This is possible only because it has billions of profiles to comb through for significant patterns which could not be discovered by examining them one by one. The user who gives up this information does not know they are doing so; it’s even possible that the company didn’t know it was collecting it at the time if the algorithms to extract it had not then been developed.","For many people, this implied bargain will be worth it. Facebook has vast networking effects on its side, so that the offer it makes might be paraphrased as “give us your data or you’ll never talk to your grandchildren, or your friends, again”. This is an offer some users can’t refuse. But the calculation changes when the purpose of data manipulation switches from commerce to politics. Democratic politics are far more than just another marketplace, and must be protected from the kind of techniques that are used to sell shoes or music. Failing to recognise this completely is the great weakness of the present bill. This is shown in two ways. The first is the refusal to properly bind the government by its own rules. The bill weakens an effective regulatory mechanism to ensure that different branches of the government do not share information we did not intend to be shared. The second, addressed by Labour’s Liam Byrne in these pages, is the failure to ensure that political advertisements can be held up to the light, so that they may be scrutinised properly. This is an essential amendment, which will do something to restore trust in a system that at present seems deserving of none."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But in doing so, he has clashed with other top executives, including Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, the Times reported, citing current and former employees who asked not to be identified.","Facebook declined to confirm whether Stamos would be leaving the company in the next few months, stating that Stamos continues to lead the company's security team.","\"He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”","In a tweet, Stamos dismissed reports of his departure as \"rumors,\" and said he is \"still fully engaged\" with his work at Facebook despite his role changing.","\"It's true that my role did change,\" he wrote shortly after the Times story broke. \"I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.\"","According to the Times, Stamos plans to leave in August and has been helping his dwindling security team transfer to other divisions across the company.","If he does leave, Stamos will be the first high-level employee to depart Facebook since the platform's misinformation crisis came into public view. The Times report also follows Facebook's announcement last week that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica over evidence that it had used data from 50 million user profiles to craft messages on the social network designed at influencing elections.","Cambridge Analytica rose to prominence for its work on Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and has been accused of having exercised shadowy influence over British voters.","In now-deleted tweets sent this weekend, Stamos pushed back against calling the Cambridge Analytica data grab a \"breach,\" explaining that the company had since updated its interface \"to remove the ability to see this kind of friend data,\" a move he said was \"controversial with app developers at the time.\"","Before joining Facebook, Stamos led information security at Yahoo, a role he took over shortly after more than 1 billion user accounts were hacked in 2013.

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Tech companies like Google, Twitter, and especially Facebook, have been hammered with criticism from a large portion of the population — including lawmakers — for purportedly helping Trump win the 2016 election with the platform’s inherent offerings. How much social media campaigns actually had an effect on election results appears dubious, or at least unclear, and may not even be quantifiable. What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization.","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Severalreports, including The NYT’s one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.” But as noted by Grewal in an update made Satuday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts.

They then make your sensitive data profile available for invasive targeted advertising that can follow you around the Internet.","This advertising system is designed to enable hyper-targeting, which has many unintended consequences, such as the ability for bad actors to use the system to influence the most susceptible or to exclude groups in a way that facilitates discrimination.","\"These two companies have amassed huge data profiles on each person, which can include your interests, purchases, search, browsing and location history, and much more.\"","Because of their entrenched positions in a wide array of Internet services, each collecting personal information that together combine into these massive digital profiles, Google and Facebook can offer hyper-targeting much better than the competition.","As a result, they now make up 63 percent of all digital advertising, and accounted for 74 percent of this market's growth in 2017, according to eMarketer. Together they form a tight digital advertising duopoly, showing no signs of abating.","Google and Facebook also use your data as input for increasingly sophisticated AI algorithms that put you in a filter bubble — an alternate digital universe that controls what you see in their products, based on what their algorithms think you are most likely to click on.","These echo chambers distort people's reality, creating a myriad of unintended consequences such as increasing societal polarization. On their unending march to profit from more and more personal information, Google and Facebook have shown little regard for all the negative consequences of their runaway algorithms.","So how do we move forward from here?","Don't be fooled by claims of self-regulation, as any useful long-term reforms of Google and Facebook's data privacy practices fundamentally oppose their core business models: hyper-targeted advertising based on more and more intrusive personal surveillance. Change must come from the outside.","Unfortunately, we've seen relatively little from Washington. Congress and federal agencies need to take a fresh look at what can be done to curb these data monopolies. They first need to demand more algorithmic and privacy policy transparency, so people can truly understand the extent of how their personal information is being collected, processed and used by these companies. Only then can informed consent be possible.","They also need to legislate that people own their own data, enabling real opt-outs. Finally, they need to restrict how data can be combined including being more aggressive at blocking acquisitions that further consolidate data power, which will pave the way for more competition in digital advertising.","Until we see such meaningful changes, consumers should vote with their feet. DuckDuckGo found that about a quarter of American adults are already taking significant actions to take back their privacy. Helping in this effort are seamless browser add-ons that will block Google and Facebook's hidden trackers across the Internet, as well as more private alternatives to their core services. I can say from my own experience, you can indeed live Google and Facebook free.","If we do nothing about Google and Facebook, we will get more of the same: more hyper-targeting, more algorithmic bias, less competition and the further erosion of collateral industries, like media. Enough is enough.","The complete loss of personal privacy in the Internet age is not inevitable. Through thoughtful regulation and increased consumer choice, we can choose a brighter path. I hope to look back at 2018 as a turning point in data privacy, where we awoke to the unacceptable implications of two companies controlling so much of our digital future.","Commentary by Gabriel Weinberg, CEO and founder of DuckDuckGo, which makes online privacy tools, including an alternative search engine to Google.

(Elyse Samuels, Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)","Late on Friday, Facebook made an unexpected announcement: The data firm Cambridge Analytica, hyped as integral to President Trump’s election, was suspended from the social network for using data collected improperly from Facebook users.","It is a complicated issue that many people might have missed, given the timing of the announcement. With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","Watch more!","Facebook shares fell by about 5 percent on March 19 after reports that a firm that worked on President Trump's campaign had inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users. (Reuters)","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian.","Everything you need to know about the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook debacle","Facebook's actions and public statements are now facing inquiries from several federal agencies regarding the mishandling of millions of users' personal data.

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports “several days ago” that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large scale research project in the U.S.,” but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan’s data was used in its 2016 election work for the “avoidance of doubt.”","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump’s general-election campaign.","Trump’s campaign Saturday denied using the firm’s data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","“The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,” the campaign said in a statement. “Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.”","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.","Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.","Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller’s investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel’s investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.","Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

If people are being thought-controlled in this kind of way there needs to be protection and they at least need to know about it.\"","A Facebook spokeswoman said the research, published this month in the journal of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the US, was carried out \"to improve our services and to make the content people see on Facebook as relevant and engaging as possible\".","She said: \"A big part of this is understanding how people respond to different types of content, whether it's positive or negative in tone, news from friends, or information from pages they follow.\"","But other commentators voiced fears that the process could be used for political purposes in the runup to elections or to encourage people to stay on the site by feeding them happy thoughts and so boosting advertising revenues.","He asked: \"Could the CIA incite revolution in Sudan by pressuring Facebook to promote discontent? Should that be legal? Could Mark Zuckerberg swing an election by promoting Upworthy [a website aggregating viral content] posts two weeks beforehand? Should that be legal?\"","It was claimed that Facebook may have breached ethical and legal guidelines by not informing its users they were being manipulated in the experiment, which was carried out in 2012.","The study said altering the news feeds was \"consistent with Facebook's data use policy, to which all users agree prior to creating an account on Facebook, constituting informed consent for this research\".","But Susan Fiske, the Princeton academic who edited the study, said she was concerned. \"People are supposed to be told they are going to be participants in research and then agree to it and have the option not to agree to it without penalty.\"","James Grimmelmann, professor of law at Maryland University, said Facebook had failed to gain \"informed consent\" as defined by the US federal policy for the protection of human subjects, which demands explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's participation, a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks and a statement that participation is voluntary. \"This study is a scandal because it brought Facebook's troubling practices into a realm – academia – where we still have standards of treating people with dignity and serving the common good,\" he said on his blog.","It is not new for internet firms to use algorithms to select content to show to users and Jacob Silverman, author of Terms of Service: Social Media, Surveillance, and the Price of Constant Connection, told Wire magazine on Sunday the internet was already \"a vast collection of market research studies; we're the subjects\".","\"What's disturbing about how Facebook went about this, though, is that they essentially manipulated the sentiments of hundreds of thousands of users without asking permission,\" he said. \"Facebook cares most about two things: engagement and advertising. If Facebook, say, decides that filtering out negative posts helps keep people happy and clicking, there's little reason to think that they won't do just that. As long as the platform remains such an important gatekeeper – and their algorithms utterly opaque – we should be wary about the amount of power and trust we delegate to it.\"","Robert Blackie, director of digital at Ogilvy One marketing agency, said the way internet companies filtered information they showed users was fundamental to their business models, which made them reluctant to be open about it.","\"To guarantee continued public acceptance they will have to discuss this more openly in the future,\" he said. \"There will have to be either independent reviewers of what they do or government regulation. If they don't get the value exchange right then people will be reluctant to use their services, which is potentially a big business problem.\""],"isopubdate":"2014-06-29"}

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account.

The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

ABC News has learned that watchdog group Common Cause has filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and Justice Department alleging that Cambridge Analytica broke federal election laws barring foreigners from participating in the strategies of US political campaigns. According to Common Cause, the UK firm ignored warnings to avoid involvement in American political committees and provided its Facebook user data to help target campaign efforts that included the presidential runs of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz as well as a John Bolton super PAC.","In particular, the complaint references a New York Times story documenting an attorney's July 22, 2014 memo to Steve Bannon, GOP donor Rebekah Mercer and Cambridge Analytica chief Alexander Nix warning against foreign involvement in strategy. They could collect and process data, but US citizens had to interpret that data -- and Nix was told to recuse himself from management of US clients to be safe. Nix reportedly ignored that advice, making key decisions around US clients for both the 2014 and 2016 elections.","Cambridge Analytica hasn't commented on the election complaints, but has denied doing anything illegal by using an app billed as an academic tool to collect user data for over 50 million people without their consent.

But it's unclear whether CA did anything wrong here, or if it was just engaged in the kind of micro-targeted marketing common in consumer and political campaigns.","On Sunday, Facebook announced that it had suspended the accounts of CA and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL). \"In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica [and to] Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies,\" explained Facebook VP Paul Grewal in a statement.","Facebook Login lets websites and apps offer the option to sign in using your Facebook account, and it lets them request and obtain data from those who do. Kogan had created a personality-test app that was download by around 270,000 people, according to Facebook. This, Facebook says, gave Kogan access to such user info as \"the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.\"","All of this is standard. Where Kogan crossed a line and violated Facebook's terms of service was in passing this information on to third parties. When Facebook found this out, it suspended Kogan's Login account and demanded he, CA, and Wylie delete the data; all confirmed that they did. But now Facebook says it has reason to suspect that \"not all data was deleted.\"","What's lifted this story into big news territory is the fact that the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in the summer of 2016.","Senate Intelligence Committee members immediately called for more regulation of digital political advertising and more investigations. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) wants Mark Zuckerberg to appear before a Judiciary panel. Meanwhile, the U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office announced this morning that it's launching its own investigation. State prosecutors are wading in too.","Both U.S. and U.K. officials say they're concerned that Facebook didn't notify users about Kogan's \"breach.\" But Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos insisted in a series of now-deleted Saturday tweets that calling it a breach was wrong:","CA issued its own series of sassy tweets, starting with \"Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don't use or hold any Facebook data.\" It said the company \"did not use any Facebook data for the 2016 Trump campaign\" and opined that \"advertising is not coercive; people are smarter than that.\"","\"This isn't a spy movie,\" CA continued. \"We're a data analytics company doing research & analysis on commercial, public and data sets for clients\" that span \"the political mainstream.\"","It also pointed out that Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign was \"famously data-driven\" and \"pioneered microtargeting\" of the sort CA does.","Critics of the kerfuffle over CA's actions have also been pointing to the Obama campaign. In late 2014, Facebook shifted its policy to prevent future campaigns from using the same sort of \"sophisticated social targeting\"—heralded then as \"a powerful new form of voter outreach\"—that Obama data gurus had employed.","If you're hysterical about privacy on principle, fine. But the reason people are up in arms is because someone they dislike did it. When Obama did it, people thought it was cool.https://t.co/fJO2IOgreh","CA says it didn't use the Facebook data to target potential Trump voters, and it says it didn't know that Kogan wasn't supposed to share the data his app had collected. But even if it did use the data that way, and even if it did know where it came from, the only real violation would be using Facebook user data in a way that company itself sanctioned until four years ago. Calling such actions \"a project to turn tens of millions of Facebook profiles into a unique political weapon\" (as TheGuardiandoes) hovers somewhere between hyperbolic and flat-out wrong. It drastically mischaracterizes the nature and novelty of microtargeted political ads, in a way strongly reminiscent of the whole \"Russian election hacking\" hoopla as a whole.","There's an emerging tendency—one seen repeatedly when new forms of media emerge—to regard any form of online advertising or social media campaigns as deceptive and devious if political actors are involved. People worried about the same thing when targeted robocalls began, and when TV political ads were new, and so on, back throughout the history of politics and persuasion.","With every iteration of this, we see the same fear that people are powerless against the secret messages encorded into these ads. But as the Tufts political scientist Eitan Hersh tweeted Sunday, \"every claim about psychographics etc made by or about [Cambridge Analytica] is BS.\" This is nothing like a precise science or a devious plot here.","This would be a fine opportunity to discuss how much Facebook users really understand about who sees their data, or how we can improve Americas' privacy, or how Facebook tries to be all things to all people. Instead, a lot of people want to force this into a narrative about election influence. In doing so, they ascribe way too much power and sophistication to advertisers and political consultants, and way too little responsibility and literacy to the rest of us.","Editor's Note: We invite comments and request that they be civil and on-topic.

I'm glad the politicians are all white as snow.","Except, the Dems didn't take data without people's permission. Nor were the Republicans prevented from doing the same--they just didn't get their act together soon enough. The Obama FB app asked users for their permission in accessing their profile and any data their friends made publicly available. Then FB gave the app users suggestions for what type of information they should share with specific friends. The FB app user was in control of the situation the whole time.","So libertarians are fine with having your data collected and sold? I look forward to hearing from Gillespie on this.","While it may be true that Obama used microtargetting that kind of whataboutism is a cynical defensive ploy.

The only public office she ever ran for and actually won was that Senate seat that was basically handed her on a silver platter.","If your data is collected and sold because you chose to use someone else's platform to share it and you agreed to it in the fine print upfront, without coercion, then you chose to share your data. You're not a victim, you're a volunteer. Maybe an uninformed volunteer. General rule for internet users, if the service you're using is free - you are the product being sold.","There aren't a lot of actual libertarians here.

Hence the \"nothingburger\" in effect comments being posted here.","You can't call this a revelation of any sort when there's a TOS that states that Facebook mines your data and sends it to third parties for profit, like what's being mentioned here. If you use Facebook, you agree to that, whether you were aware of this fact or not. It's simply called not using the service, like I don't. Sometimes, you actually have to be a rational adult about things and not want the shiniest new toy because everyone else is using it and not even read the conditions that you'll get to use the damn thing in the first place.","Gosh, so after Obama had success using data in this way they made sure no one else could do so after his second term huh? It's only a matter of time until Facebook is fully subsumed into the CIA, I guess.","The only evidence that the decision made by FB had anything to do with Obama was the speculation in this article. FB was addressing growing privacy concerns about the use of third party apps of all kinds, not just Obama's successful implementation.","\"In late 2014, Facebook shifted its policy to prevent future campaigns from using the same sort of \"sophisticated social targeting\"—heralded then as \"a powerful new form of voter outreach\"—that Obama data gurus had employed.\"","Or, to put it more accurately, they created a tool for the Democrats to use, and then got rid of it when Republicans found out about it and started using it.","Because it had never been intended that anyone but Democrats get to use it.","No, this isn't racial, it wasn't just Obama using it in that election. They shut it down when the wrong party started using it.","Wouldn't shock me in the slightest if there's some new FB analytics tool out there the Democrats have been given, which is just better hid.

After the next election the US will be a one party state!\"","Then the next election doesn't make the US a one party state, there's blowback, rinse and repeat. I guess they figure one of these times it will be true.","When you've got 90% of the media doing your spin, wash, interpret-in-a-sophisticated-sounding-manner, repeat work for you, I expect your worries about \"blowback\" are somewhat ameliorated. It does make their flattering \"we're the smart party\" claims seem kind of embarrassing, though, when they are so confident nobody on their side can analyze, or will remember, their bullshit.","Actually it was in spring 2014, before anyone had an idea of Trump running, and when everyone assumed the eventual winner would be HRC. So...I doubt it was about keeping Republicans from using it. (Romney used FB app data, but came to the party too late to be effective.) Also, the method used by Obama and Romney didn't involve surreptitiously targeting people or their data. It provided FB users suggestions for who among their friends they should consider sharing posts, articles, etc. The FB user was in control of what and with whom it was shared.","I agree 100% with ELizabeth Nolan Brown above. I do want to point out that, while Psychology is currently more witch-doctoring than science, we will probably develop a real science of psychology in the future. We will have a fairly good understandin of how the human brain and mind work, what causes various \"neuroses\", etc. We will probably be able to cure most neuroses, addicitons, etc. (Including my tendency to spend way too much time on Facebook, Quora, and commenting on articles in Reason.)","But implicit in that is that we may be able to get people to do things for reasons that most people would call \"nefarious\" (wicked/abominable, from \"not right/lawful\", or \"not what the gods want\"). Selling people things they don't need and don't even really want except for the moment when they are affected by the advertisement or whatever, stuff like that.","The most revoltin' development I have yet heard on this was the commentator on NPR this morning claiming -- without even an effort to justify it -- that Trump may have handed this data on to the Russians to use to influence the election.","There's an emerging tendency—one seen repeatedly when new forms of media emerge—to regard any form of online advertising or social media campaigns as deceptive and devious if political actors are involved.","Boy, Ms Nolan, did you ever strike-out on this one. Nowhere did you mention the Mercers, Steve Bannon and Breitbart, and how they are intertwined with Cambridge Analytica.","\"British TV network Channel 4 News has caught Cambridge Analytica executives admitting on camera that they've used bribes and Ukrainian sex workers to try to help the political candidates they've been working for. This came after the New York Times revealed this weekend that Cambridge Analytica held meetings with Russia and then lied about it. Now it turns out Bannon and the Mercers are suddenly finding themselves in the same undesirable boat, thanks to the explosive scandals coming out of a company they all have deep ties to: Cambridge Analytica.\"","Since we have no public evidence of who used this data or how it was used, i'm not ready to close the books on the FB/CA mess.","Pitching for candidates is one thing. But we know that there has been a concerted effort to undermine the foundations of our government calling into question:","the fairness & accuracy of elections (a slap in the face of the half million or so fellow citizens who volunteer their time to oversee fairness & accuracy of elections in the US).","the judicial system, a slap in the face of citizens who populate juries, as well as court officers & the police.","the belief that a person can not overcome preferred personal outcomes in the performance of their sworn duties to the Constitution as a police officer, a member of the military, a jurist, a court clerk, a poll worker, or any other public servant.","The growing currency of completely irrational conspiracy theories.","The complete list of similar issues is both long & distinguished, but you get the idea.","On closer examination, it may be the work of FB/CA is just like selling toothpaste, but from what i've seen so far I doubt it. I'm certainly not ready to write it off as a \"non-story.\"","Nobody on here seems to have read the actual details revealed by the whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who created the original data-collecting app for these guys. There was a lot more than marketing going on. Stolen data, helping wikileaks distribute stolen emails, compiling psychological profiles with data they didn't own or have the right to use, etc. Now, CA execs are on tape explaining how they use sex workers, bribes, and other work \"from the shadows\" to impact elections around the world. Real stand-up guys.","This gives me the same feel that the O'Keefe videos do; Is it really that easy to walk up to somebody, start chatting them up, and next thing you know they're confessing heinous crimes? You wouldn't think so, but here you are, proof to the contrary.","Welcome to the dirty underbelly of politics. Cambridge Analytica isn't as different from GPS Fusion as some would like you to think.","Amazing how many \"libertarians\" are rushing to defend Trump.

Following news that millions of users’ personal data had been collected without permission by a third party, the social media giant caught some flak for the way it handled metadata collection on Android. In an effort to assuage public ill will, Facebook announced today that it’s making user settings—especially ones dealing with account data and privacy—easier to access and more transparent.","Historically, Facebook’s settings have been convoluted. By its own admission, prior to today’s announced update, settings in the mobile app were “spread across nearly 20 different screens.” In a blog post, Facebook says it’s cleaned up the settings section to make it easier to understand; the changes also emphasize users’ control over their data and privacy. “Most of these updates have been in the works for some time,” Facebook says, “but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.”","Facebook settings as they appear before (left) and after (right) recent changes.","It’ll likely take more than an overhaul of app settings to solve Facebook’s privacy problems: Reuters reports that three users are perusing a class action lawsuit against the company over the Android metadata kerfuffle, asserting that their privacy had been violated by Facebook’s collection of their call and text logs. Facebook had previously issued a statement assuring users that their sharing of the data the lawsuit pertains to is strictly voluntary and can be stopped at any time."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"http://www.cyberinject.com/facebook-starts-polishing-its-privacy-messaging-ahead-of-gdpr/","title":"Facebook starts polishing its privacy messaging ahead of GDPR | CyberInject","text":["Facebook starts polishing its privacy messaging ahead of GDPR","As the May 25 deadline for compliance with the EU’s updated privacy framework fast approaches Facebook is continuing to PR the changes it’s making to try to meet the new data protection standard — and steer away from the specter of fines that can scale as high as 4% of a company’s global turnover.","Today it’s published — for the first time — what it dubs a set of “privacy principles” that it says guide its approach to handling users’ information, making grand claims like: “We give you control of your privacy“, “You own and can delete your information” and “We are accountable“.","In truth it’s just cribbing chunks of the GDPR and claiming the regulation’s principles as its own. So full marks for spin there.","The EU’s sharply tightening enforcement regime for data protection also explains why Facebook hasn’t felt the need to make these kind of claims in public before.","Indeed, myriad historical snafus show the company pushing in the polar opposite direction where user data and privacy is concerned. (And in more recent history too — e.g. this, this or this, to point to just a few of many counter examples to these newly published ‘principles’.)","No matter, the days of Facebook feeling free to play fast and loose with user data are dwindling — thanks to regulatory interventions.","Under GDPR, the new game Facebook will need to play is gaming trust: Which it to say that it will need to make users feel they trust its brand to protect their privacy and therefore make them feel happy to consent to the company processing their data (rather than asking it to delete it). So PR and carefully packaged info-messaging to users is going to be increasingly important for Facebook’s business, going forward.","To wit: The company said today it will be launching an educational campaign aimed at helping users understand and exercise their rights.","This will be run via explainer videos (featuring the likes of cartoon chameleons) dropped into the News Feed to — as Facebook tells it — give users “information on important privacy topics like how to control what information Facebook uses to show you ads, how to review and delete old posts, and even what it means to delete your account”.","It also said it will be pushing out reminders to Facebookers in the EU to take its existing “privacy check-up” feature — to “make sure they feel comfortable with what they are sharing with who”.","These reminders will begin today and roll out over the week, it says. (Facebook users in the US presumably aren’t getting this special extra privacy check nudge at this time.)","These moves follow an announcement last week, by COO Sheryl Sandberg, saying Facebook would be launching an overhauled global privacy settings hub. Although there’s still no word on exactly when that will launch. Nor what exactly it will look like (and, as ever with privacy and data protection, the devil really is in the detail).","Nor, indeed, whether it really will be universal — “global” — i.e. will it offer identical controls to users in the EU and the US, for example.","Facebook said today that the feature will put “core privacy settings in a single place”. “We’re designing this based on feedback from people, policymakers and privacy experts around the world,” it added. But whether those “core privacy” settings will vary depending on where in the world a Facebook user hails from will be one to watch.","Its educational largess around the EU regulations can be explained by the fact that the risks attached to GDPR’s supersized penalties also inflate the liabilities for data controllers (like Facebook) that share user data with third parties for processing. Such as, in its case, if it shares user data with advertisers.","“Certain obligations now apply directly to data processors, and controllers must bind them to certain contractual commitments to ensure data is processed safely and legally,” it writes in this FAQ.","Though it also notes there may be instances in which its business is acting as a data processor (such as when it’s supplying its custom audiences product or its workplace premium product).","However the FAQ confirms that if advertisers are using its on-platform advertising tools then Facebook remains the data controller — and is therefore responsible for ensuring GDPR compliance (“including by providing notice and establishing a legal basis”).","Another question (self-)posed in the FAQ asks whether, under GDPR, Facebook sees any incoming restrictions in the way brands use its ad platform and tools?","Its answer to this suggests it does — in instances where advertisers are providing (and thus controlling) the user data for targeting the ads on its platform (via Facebook’s data file Custom Audiences feature) — though it’s not exactly spelling out the implications for advertisers in this situation.","The ‘not-long-enough;wtf-does-that-actually-mean?’ of that is, under GDPR, advertisers that had been attaching their customer databases to Facebook’s ad targeting tools without their customers really knowing they were doing so will — from May 25, 2018 — need to tell their customers they are doing that and get them to agree to being targeted with ads on Facebook (and stop doing it if they don’t agree — which seems pretty highly likely).","Or else be very confident they can show another valid legal basis — i.e. other than consent — for ad-stalking their customers when they use Facebook.","Of course Facebook itself faces a similar risk — i.e. of Facebook users not consenting to it targeting them with ads itself, powered by their personal data.","But the company is likely to be far better resourced than many of its advertisers to work to gain that consent (via — for example — slick, feel-good ‘infomercial’ videos seeded in the Facebook News Feed).","It also of course controls a hugely powerful info-targeting platform which means it will more easily be able to figure out — maybe even A/B test! — how best to position its ‘trust us’ brand messaging to win over its users.","So how far this ‘game of trust’ can really be judged to be fairly weighted from a consumer point of view when the platform in question is so very powerful is a pretty existential question for the regulation. But we won’t have too long to start to see how effective (or otherwise) GDPR is at forging a lasting link between ‘data’ and ‘protection’."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}
{"originalurl":"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/mark-zuckerberg-too-much-power-facebook/?utm_source=Facebook","title":"Does Mark Zuckerberg have too much power at the helm of Facebook?","text":["Facebook is not alone in this respect. There appears to be a trend among newly-listed, mostly high-growth, firms to have these corporate governance structures that provide shareholders with weak rights when it comes to running the company. The dual class share structure, as in Facebook’s case, is only one of several measures to ensure that the founding member team remains in power.","As well as Facebook, companies that have established these sorts of governance mechanisms include Berkshire Hathaway, Expedia, FitBit, Ford, Google (Alphabet), GoPro, Hyatt Hotels, Snap, and Under Armour. The main defence of this governance measure, used by the founders or family heirs of these firms, is that it allows the companies to take a long-term view and make investment decisions that may not necessarily yield results in the short run.","But the recent Facebook scandal also highlights that these corporate governance mechanisms appear to make firms immune to calls for change, particularly if the leadership of the firm is affected.","Good vs bad governance","Shareholders are the main providers of capital for publicly listed companies. In return, they receive a variety of rights, such as voting at the annual general meeting and electing the directors who sit on the board.","Academic findings suggest that firms in which shareholders have many opportunities to raise their voice tend to perform better than firms with weak shareholder rights. Hence, firms with strong shareholder rights are often considered “good” corporate governance firms. Firms with weak shareholder rights are typically referred to as “bad” corporate governance firms.","This is, however, a very simplified way of describing things. There is no blueprint for good corporate governance as every firm is likely to have different needs, and these also change over the life cycle of the firm.","Yet, there is little a controversy about the fact that when there is little opportunity for existing shareholders or outside activist investors to influence things, managers and directors can become entrenched and make decisions that could harm the business – and therefore shareholders. And companies where the board of directors can make decisions without fear of being replaced have been labelled “dictatorship firms”.","Pros and cons of dictatorship","As it turns out, under certain conditions, dictatorship firms may actually perform well. Recent researchsuggests that in order to foster innovation, reward for long-term success and job security are important. The way that dictatorship firms are set up facilitates this.","Data also suggests that dictatorship firms can increase company value by allowing it to take a long-term view. Hence, shareholders provide capital to dictatorship firms by trusting the skills and vision of the founder and leadership team to identify, invest in, and manage projects that guarantee continual high future growth.","But dictatorship-style corporate governance can become problematic in three scenarios. First, when growth and innovation slow down. This contradicts one of the main arguments in favour of dictatorship firms – that their long-term focus fosters innovation and that this is associated with high growth. But when growth does slow down, the firm will have fewer investment opportunities.","Plus, lower spending tends to mean higher future cash holdings and academic evidence suggests that as companies accumulate more cash, they tend to make worse investment decisions. Hence, in those firms, it becomes more important to monitor how capital is spent and to consider paying out more to shareholders.","A second problematic situation for dictatorship firms is how to handle succession – something Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has spoken of. As Musk puts it: the dual class structure can be taken to an extreme “where one class basically doesn’t count”. That’s the public shareholders. And, although possible, it is rare that the children of the founders are the right people to continue running the firm (which is a common line of succession in a dictatorship firm). Hence, there needs to be a path towards a single share class so that control is not passed on via dictatorship.","The third problematic scenario for dictatorship firms is when a dramatic change in the course of action of the company is required – particularly in response to scandals. Since 2010, Facebook has had ten sets of legal issues (excluding the Cambridge Analytica scandal). In a company with strong shareholder rights, it is likely that a change in the executive leadership team would have happened by now.","Not all hope for better corporate governance is lost, however. The ride-hailing app company Uber provides an example of how change can still happen, despite having an entrenched leadership team. After several scandals emerged at the end of 2017, its board made former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick step down and revoked his super-voting rights, creating equal voting power among shareholders. Facebook is yet to make similar moves but it would create a more democratic governance structure if it did so."],"isopubdate":""}

And one of the people with questions joins us now. This is Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro. His office is looking into both companies. Hey there.","JOSH SHAPIRO: Hey, good to be with you.","KELLY: Well, we are glad to have you with us. What went through your mind when you first heard about all this?","SHAPIRO: Well, just deeply troubled by this. You know, I've made protecting consumer information a cornerstone of the work I do in the Pennsylvania attorney general's office. And as soon as I saw these reports, I immediately instructed my team to begin reviewing it, to get right on it. And look; I take the use of consumer data very, very seriously, and protecting Pennsylvania consumers' personal information is really a top priority.","KELLY: So to be clear, you all are reviewing. You haven't launched a formal investigation at this point. But what would be the crime here? I mean, what specific laws are you looking at that might have been violated?","SHAPIRO: Look; consumers using Facebook deserve to know where their data's going and what it's being used for. And the reason that I would stop at just saying we're looking into it now and not yet say that we've launched an investigation is because at this juncture what we're really reviewing is the terms of service agreement between Facebook and its users, me and...","KELLY: OK.","SHAPIRO: ...The other, you know, millions of people out there, particularly the users here in Pennsylvania because look; by Facebook's act of giving that data to the researcher, by passing the data along to that researcher, I want to know whether or not that violated the terms of service that we all sign up for when we use Facebook. If in fact there was a violation or we conclude that there's reason to believe that there was a violation, then I think you could see us launching a full-fledged investigation.","KELLY: Let me drill down on this, this question of the terms of service because Facebook has come out and definitively said this was not a data breach. No passwords were hacked. No information was stolen. No systems were infiltrated. From a legal point of view, does that matter?","SHAPIRO: It really doesn't. You can have a non-existence of a data breach as Facebook says but still have a breach of the terms of service. And that's a really important distinction. Look; it's one of the reasons why we'll be sitting down with Facebook later this week to really drill down on what they believe occurred. But you're correct in raising the issue of a data breach. This isn't Equifax, which we are leading the national investigation on, where data was hacked into and stolen. This is really a question of whether or not the terms of service that Facebook users agreed to were violated, and whether they were violated by Facebook allowing this information to get into the hands of the researcher and ultimately Cambridge Analytica.","KELLY: I mean, as we - anybody who has a Facebook account knows, when you sign up to get that account, you have to give consent. You agree to share private information with Facebook. You know, I think in the 21st century we all understand there's some risk. Is part of this that people need to wise up, need to make sure we opt for all the privacy controls we can possibly check yes to, and then understand maybe something's going to leak?","SHAPIRO: People should always be mindful of what terms of service they agree to whether it's with Facebook or any other company. But you see, I'm going to hold Facebook accountable to those terms. And I can't believe that those terms allow for users' data to ultimately be used in the way they were by Cambridge Analytica. But I - to answer your question directly, I don't think that the American people should be forced to accept the fact that maybe some of their data will be lost at some point or maybe some of their data could be compromised and used for other purposes. If you sign up to have your data used in a particular way, you should have confidence in that user agreement.","KELLY: Josh Shapiro - he is the Democratic attorney general of Pennsylvania.

She will appear at Club Risque in November.","John Chennavasin/Zuma Press/TNS","Adult film actress Stormy Daniels discussed her alleged affair with President Donald Trump in 60 Minutes' highest-rated episode in a decade this past weekend.

According to a Facebook event posting, Daniels will perform at the strip club's locations in Pennsport, Northeast Philly, and Bristol throughout her time in town.","Details regarding what Daniels' upcoming appearances entail were not immediately available. However, the adult film actress previously launched a \"Making America Horny Again\" strip club tour earlier this year, and stops have included adult performances and meet-and-greets.","More than 22 millions viewers tuned into Daniels interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes on Sunday, giving the program its highest ratings in about 10 years.

He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially.","Opponents of President Trump have tried the “resist” movement, without really altering his agenda.","They’ve tried claiming his campaign colluded with Russia in 2016, but there’s been no evidence.","They’ve tried portraying him as a bumbling stooge who doesn’t understand the legislative process, the Washington swamp or politics.","Now, they’re suggesting that he broke some inexact boundary by using statistics and analytics in his campaign, apparently obtained from Facebook users.","Reuters jumped in to attack, stating: “Facebook Inc’s shares fell more than 4 percent … after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump’s campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users.”","The report said even “the head of European Parliament said on Monday that EU lawmakers will investigate whether the data misuse has taken place, adding the allegation is an unacceptable violation of citizens’ privacy rights.”","“Facebook is not a victim here, and Cambridge Analytica is by no means the only entity which has Facebook’s own data collection,” he said Monday. “Facebook collects the data. Cambridge Analytica is like any other outfit that found a way to access it, and it’s not illegal.","“When Facebook users agreed to participate in a survey, there are disclaimers.”","The claim is that Cambridge, working for President Trump’s campaign, “gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users,” Reuters said.","“One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised ‘systemic problems’ with Facebook’s business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform,” the report said.","Analysts said it created a “potentially … serious public relations ‘black eye’ for the company, and its value dropped by billions because of the episode.”","Limbaugh, however, said that whatever Cambridge did in obtaining and analyzing data isn’t anything different from what other companies have done already for other campaigns.","“Folks, the bottom line is, it isn’t any big deal because it’s nothing unique. The Democrats have perfected using the personal data stored by internet companies for I don’t know how long. And Google leads the league in it, and they’re in bed with the Democrats and always have been. Facebook is number two. They’re in bed with the Democrats,” Limbaugh said.","“It’s the modern day equivalent of high-tech grassroots politics. It’s all about finding out who your voters are and where they are and what they respond to, which politics and parties have been doing for as long as there have been both. But the Democrats, you see, and Obama, the brilliant, the cool, the sophisticated Obama, and Eric Schmidt and Sergey Brin and Larry Page and all these high quality leftists, they exclusively own that sector.”","He explained: “Only they are smart enough brilliant enough, liberal enough, correct enough, sensitive enough to ever deal with this stuff while excluding everybody else. And here comes, to them, unacceptable, reprehensible bigot using their systems and outsmarting them in the process to win an election they thought they had arranged, they thought they had in the bag.”","He pointed out a 2013 article in the New York Times that reported the Obama campaign used as much information as it could obtain about voters, showing what they were watching and to what they would respond.","“The system gave Obama a significant advantage over Mitt Romney, according to Democrats and many Republicans (at least those who were not on Romney’s media team),” the report said.","“Using data wasn’t new for the Obama strategists. The 2008 campaign developed the most sophisticated system to date to identify tens of millions of voters and place them into useful categories: those most likely to vote Republican, who would be ignored; those supporting Obama – and how likely they were to vote. That system – based on a complicated scoring method that relied on the processing of reams of data – was first devised by an outside consultant, Ken Strasma,” the report said.","Limbaugh pointed out Cambridge is owned by the Mercer family, well-known supporters of conservative causes. To Democrats, they are “illegitimate, they’re racist, they’re bigoted, they’re homophobes and dangerous.”","The point is that in 2013 the New York Times is “praising Obama and praising the geniuses on Obama’s tech team” for being able to figure out how to data mine from Google and Facebook to advance Obama’s agenda. “So the very same thing that media is trying to make you think is criminal activity, they were praising Obama to the hilt in countless newspaper stories all during 2013,” he said.","He cited AP’s claim it was a “data leak.”","“It was not a leak! It was not a hack! There is nothing illegal here,” he said. “The Russians are a bunch of amateur pikers compared to what Cambridge Analytica was doing. But Cambridge Analytica is also pikers compared to what Obama was doing with Eric Schmidt and the Google guys who practically had a satellite office in the West Wing during the Obama administration,” he said.","He explained: “Everybody was getting into Facebook data because that’s why Facebook collects it! There was no hack. There was no breach. … Cambridge Analytica … obtained their data by doing exactly what other Facebook app developers did. It’s nothing unique. It’s nothing exclusive, and it’s nothing out of the ordinary.”","He blasted Demcorats who were demanding investigations.","“Obama gets praised as being a genius for doing this exact thing five years ago! The paper that proclaimed Obama a genius in two or three different stories is now writing of the same kind of operation as almost criminal when it’s done on behalf of Donald Trump.”","At the same time as the allegations were being made that something untoward provided the Trump campaign with data, officials at a U.K. broadcaster claimed Cambridge Analytica was “secretly filmed saying they could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and Ukrainian sex workers.”","The report said CEO Alexander Nix said the company could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house” in a conversation that appeared to reference foreign elections.","The report said the company, “at the center of a scandal over its role in the harvesting of more than 50 million Facebook profiles, made the recordings in London.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever. … We routinely undertake conversations with prospective clients to try to tease out any unethical or illegal intentions.'”","CNBC reported the fall in Facebook stock prices triggered a general decline in the stock market Monday.","The Independent Journal Review said a former Obama campaign official plainly stated that the campaign was allowed to “mine massive amounts of Facebook data,” because the company supported the campaign.","“In a Sunday tweet thread, Carol Davidsen, former director of integration and media analytics for Obama for America, said the 2012 campaign led Facebook to ‘suck out the whole social graph’ and target potential voters. They would then use that data to do things like append their email lists.”","The report said Facebook found out but allowed the mining to continue.","“They came to office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side,” Davidsen tweeted.","Facebook users in various ways give permission for their profiles to be accessed and information used."],"isopubdate":"2018-09-19"}

It is part of this Administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel’s work.\"","A spokesperson for McCabe wrote that McCabe learned of his firing \"from a press release.\"","A source told BuzzFeed News on Saturday that McCabe had prepared personal memos detailing his interactions with President Trump, as well as what happened during the time period when the president fired former FBI director James Comey.","A little more than two hours after the news broke, Trump himself weighed in in a late-night tweet, calling the firing \"[a] great day for Democracy.\"","Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!","President Trump had previously questioned why Sessions hadn't replaced McCabe in the FBI's leadership and has been harshly critical of McCabe — questioning his objectivity given campaign contributions his wife had gotten from former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons, during her unsuccessful Virginia state Senate campaign.","McCabe's firing, indirectly, came out of the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into the handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state.","Communications from the inspector general’s office regarding McCabe's candor to investigators about a news report involving the Clinton Foundation prompted a disciplinary review from the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility initiated a disciplinary review. That review, in turn, resulted in a recommendation that McCabe be fired.","That led to further review from the top officials in the Justice Department, leading to Friday's decision from Sessions.","Full statement from Attorney General Jeff Sessions:","When news of the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation broke earlier this week, DOJ spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said only, \"The department follows a prescribed process by which an employee may be terminated. That process includes recommendations from career employees, and no termination decision is final until the conclusion of that process. We have no personnel announcements at this time.\"","On Thursday, asked about the recommendation from the Office of Professional Responsibility that he be fired, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the decision was up to Sessions — but then added, \"[W]e do think it is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts a bad actor and should have some cause for concern.\"","President Trump's tweets about Andrew McCabe:","The firing could have severe ramifications for McCabe — whose pension could be affected as a result of the firing — as well as for the larger discussion of Trump’s attempts to influence the actions of the Justice Department.","The firing came at the end of a long career that spanned three decades at the FBI. McCabe joined the FBI in 1996, as a special agent assigned to the New York Field Office. A decade later, McCabe was promoted and moved to Washington, serving as a supervisor in the Counterterrorism Division at the FBI headquarters. Over the next decade, McCabe moved back and forth between increasingly senior jobs at the FBI's Washington Field Office and its headquarters, resulting in his promotion to deputy director of the FBI at the beginning of 2016.","Prior to his promotion, his wife, Jill, had run for a state Senate seat in Virginia in 2015. The funds that Trump and outside conservatives have criticized came from the Virginia Democratic Party and McAuliffe's political action committee. The campaign, which she lost, was over before McCabe was promoted to deputy director.","At the time of his wife's campaign, McCabe had no oversight of any Clinton investigation and recused himself from investigations relating to Virginia politics. After McCabe was promoted to the deputy director post, he oversaw the Clinton investigation until a report about the contributions in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election led him to recuse himself.","When Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, McCabe served as acting director of the FBI and was interviewed by Trump as a possible candidate to be Comey's successor. He served as acting director until Trump's eventual nominee, current FBI director Chris Wray, was confirmed for the role and assumed office on Aug. 2, 2017.","At that time, McCabe returned to the deputy director job until the end of January, when he announced his retirement plans. Although he stepped down as deputy director, he remained on the department’s payroll pending his scheduled retirement.","Full statement from Andrew McCabe:","Chris Geidner is a Supreme Court correspondent for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC."],"isopubdate":""}

Thousands of companies are spying on you (opinion)  - CNN","text":["(CNN) In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, news articles and commentators have focused on what Facebook knows about us. A lot, it turns out. It collects data from our posts, our likes, our photos, things we type and delete without posting, and things we do while not on Facebook and even when we're offline. It buys data about us from others. And it can infer even more: our sexual orientation, political beliefs, relationship status, drug use, and other personality traits -- even if we didn't take the personality test that Cambridge Analytica developed.","But for every article about Facebook's creepy stalker behavior, thousands of other companies are breathing a collective sigh of relief that it's Facebook and not them in the spotlight. Because while Facebook is one of the biggest players in this space, there are thousands of other companies that spy on and manipulate us for profit.","Bruce Schneier","Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls it \"surveillance capitalism.\" And as creepy as Facebook is turning out to be, the entire industry is far creepier. It has existed in secret far too long, and it's up to lawmakers to force these companies into the public spotlight, where we can all decide if this is how we want society to operate and -- if not -- what to do about it.","There are 2,500 to 4,000 data brokers in the United States whose business is buying and selling our personal data. Last year, Equifax was in thenews when hackers stole personal information on 150 million people, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver's license numbers.","You certainly didn't give it permission to collect any of that information. Equifax is one of those thousands of data brokers, most of them you've never heard of, selling your personal information without your knowledge or consent to pretty much anyone who will pay for it.","Surveillance capitalism takes this one step further. Companies like Facebook and Google offer you free services in exchange for your data. Google's surveillance isn't in the news, but it's startlingly intimate. We never lie to our search engines. Our interests and curiosities, hopes and fears, desires and sexual proclivities, are all collected and saved. Add to that the websites we visit that Google tracks through its advertising network, our Gmail accounts, our movements via Google Maps, and what it can collect from our smartphones.","That phone is probably the most intimate surveillance device ever invented. It tracks our location continuously, so it knows where we live, where we work, and where we spend our time. It's the first and last thing we check in a day, so it knows when we wake up and when we go to sleep. We all have one, so it knows who we sleep with. Uber used just some of that information to detect one-night stands; your smartphone provider and any app you allow to collect location data knows a lot more.","Surveillance capitalism drives much of the internet. It's behind most of the \"free\" services, and many of the paid ones as well. Its goal is psychological manipulation, in the form of personalized advertising to persuade you to buy something or do something, like vote for a candidate. And while the individualized profile-driven manipulation exposed by Cambridge Analytica feels abhorrent, it's really no different from what every company wants in the end. This is why all your personal information is collected, and this is why it is so valuable. Companies that can understand it can use it against you.","None of this is new. The media has been reporting on surveillance capitalism for years. In 2015, I wrote a book about it. Back in 2010, the Wall Street Journal published an award-winning two-year series about how people are tracked both online and offline, titled \"What They Know.\"","Surveillance capitalism is deeply embedded in our increasingly computerized society, and if the extent of it came to light there would be broad demands for limits and regulation. But because this industry can largely operate in secret, only occasionally exposed after a data breach or investigative report, we remain mostly ignorant of its reach.","This might change soon. In 2016, the European Union passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The details of the law are far too complex to explain here, but some of the things it mandates are that personal data of EU citizens can only be collected and saved for \"specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes,\" and only with explicit consent of the user. Consent can't be buried in the terms and conditions, nor can it be assumed unless the user opts in.

Here's just one example. In preparation for this law, PayPal quietly published a list of over 600 companies it might share your personal data with. What will it be like when every company has to publish this sort of information, and explicitly explain how it's using your personal data? We're about to find out.","In the wake of this scandal, even Mark Zuckerberg saidthat his industry probably should be regulated, although he's certainly not wishing for the sorts of comprehensive regulation the GDPR is bringing to Europe.","He's right. Surveillance capitalism has operated without constraints for far too long. And advances in both big data analysis and artificial intelligence will make tomorrow's applications far creepier than today's. Regulation is the only answer.","The first step to any regulation is transparency. Who has our data? Is it accurate? What are they doing with it? Who are they selling it to? How are they securing it? Can we delete it? I don't see any hope of Congress passing a GDPR-like data protection law anytime soon, but it's not too far-fetched to demand laws requiring these companies to be more transparent in what they're doing.","One of the responses to the Cambridge Analytica scandal is that people are deleting their Facebook accounts. It's hard to do right, and doesn't do anything about the data that Facebook collectsabout people who don't use Facebook. But it's a start. The market can put pressure on these companies to reduce their spying on us, but it can only do that if we force the industry out of its secret shadows."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

More of us now recognise the power we hand over to tech giants just by sending a simple Facebook post.","Yet with all the media attention and billions wiped off their share price, Facebooks response is still piecemeal. What has Facebook said they will do in real terms? Let’s break it down from the CEO’s post:","“we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way.”","So, problem solved right? They fixed it in 2014 and nothing more needs doing…","“we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014”","Ah, so in 2014 Facebook didn’t take the ‘most important steps’, they are taking some of those now. I guess that is why they’ve seen 50Bn wiped off their stock price. Meanwhile, for the last 4 years our data has been vulnerable to the same exploitation by other firms – we just don’t know about it yet.","“And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps.”","Ok, so if our trust has been abused again Facebook will stop them in the future. Err… isn’t the cat already out of the bag?","“we will restrict developers’ data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse.”","But I thought they fixed the problem in 2014? Are they saying they didn’t do enough?","“We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it.”","So that’s it! The only real change they are making to the platform in this announcement, the long awaited solution to privacy is to add a link at the top of the Newsfeed! Well, my trust is restored.","Ok, sarcasm aside. It’s very easy to take a punt at Facebook but they are not the only culprits. This really is a very, very serious issue globally. People are being manipulated, elections have been influenced and the lack of responsibility and accountability we are seeing cannot be tolerated any longer. Events over coming weeks will be very telling but whatever the aftermath, there needs to be a tangible change.","Why can’t Facebook just fix this? They are a massive tech firm right? Well, yes but unlike many other tech firms their entire revenue model is based on the exploitation of personal data. It’s obviously dressed up to make sure users feel safe, warm and cuddled and of course we enjoy the cool, funky features they give us, but we are the unpaid workforce and the data we produce is their oil. Any change to the mining of that oil is a huge risk to their entire business model. The reality is that Facebook are in no position to offer privacy when they are wholly reliant on data for revenue. I would feel more trusting if they accepted that and sought a more appropriate solution.","Unfortunately for these firms the the tide really is changing. Business models are now dated, and these firms are existing on borrowed time (aka very large balance sheets). If change is not effected, then profits will dwindle as other savvy firms find ways to compete (eyes east) or legislation will stop their operation altogether. One way or another they will cease to exist.","Facebook had their chance with our trust, but they have failed. Now the relationship needs to be reversed and control needs to be put back into the user’s hands. This is a terrifying prospect but a necessary one. Consumers want information, so they will choose to share their personal data and if they get a little something in return – more so. For the tech giants a new and fair relationship can exist with users enabling a more ethical and compliant way of making profit now and in the future. The internet will continue to grow, lessons have been learnt. It’s time to take heads out of the sand and get the foundations right.","How? With encryption of course, “but won’t that just break everything?”. One might think so but just like everything else in technology, boring old encryption has also evolved in to something well, quite sexy.","It is now possible for encryption to meet the privacy needs of the entire internet. At the same time, it is possible to meet the needs of legal and regulatory compliance, national security and of course monetising people’s data. A key difference is that with a modern encryption service monetisation of people’s data is controlled by the people and not the service provider. It’s a small nuance but has massive implications.","How might it work?","If I share a post on Social Media today, I can control who has access to it but the post itself is freely visible to the service provider – we already know that that is not a good thing. With a modern encryption service, I can make the post invisible to everyone – including the service provider. Now I control who can see the post by changing access to the keys that control it. I can also choose to share data about the post to the service provider (for advertising) but with a little technical wizardry I can do this without showing them the actual post. Finally, no matter where the post has been shared, I can still control access to it – now that is real privacy.","About","Scentrics provides a seamless patented encryption technology that can be used by any application to protect content stored on a device or sent to another device.

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed Klobuchar’s complaint.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” he said. “It’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said on Twitter that “Massachusetts residents deserve answers” and announced that her office will investigate.","The officials reacted to reports in The New York Times and The Guardian of London that Cambridge Analytica, which is best known for working on President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, had improperly obtained Facebook user data and retained it after claiming it had deleted the information.","Former Cambridge Analytica employee Chris Wylie said that the company obtained information from 50 million Facebook users, using it to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.","Wylie told Britain’s Channel 4 news that the company was able to amass a huge database very quickly from an app developed by an academic that vacuumed up data from Facebook users who agreed to fill out a survey, as well as their friends and contacts — a process of which most were unaware.","“Imagine I go and ask you: I say, ‘Hey, if I give you a dollar, two dollars, could you fill up this survey for me, just do it on this app’, and you say, ‘Fine,'” he said. “I don’t just capture what your responses are, I capture all of the information about you from Facebook. But also this app then crawls through your social network and captures all of that data also.”","Wylie said that allowed the company to get roughly “50 million plus” Facebook records in several months and he criticized Facebook for facilitating the process.","“Why Facebook didn’t make more inquiries when they started seeing that, you know, tens of millions of records were being pulled this way, I don’t know,” he said.","Lawmaker Collins said he would summon Nix to reappear before the Parliament committee.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements,” Collins said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign.

{"originalurl":"https://talkingtech.cliffordchance.com/en/cybersecurity/facebook--data-misuse-and-why-it-matters.html","title":"Facebook, data misuse and why it matters","text":["Data & Cybersecurity","Facebook, data misuse and why it matters","A look in to the recent issues surrounding Cambridge Analytica and Facebook","27 March 2018","As every news cycle brings further revelations about the alleged misuse of personal data by social media companies and political consultants, regulators, politicians and the public are more concerned than ever with what happens to information placed online, who has it and how it is being used.","Data protection and other enforcement authorities and politicians have significant powers to conduct investigations and take action, whether by imposing penalties or restrictions or by requiring senior executives to provide answers. As recent events have shown, the mere fact of their embarking on doing so can have immediate and severe commercial consequences. In serious cases such as this, the costs of investigations are far exceeded by the much longer lasting damage to the share prices and reputations of organisations involved.","The current press furore will subside. Lessons will be learned about how organisations should react to the reputational crises that arise from allegations about data security and usage. However, issues relating to data security and misuse will remain high on regulators' and politicians' agendas worldwide for some time. It is likely that attention will soon turn to the collection, use and analysis of data by a much wider range of businesses than those at the centre of current allegations. Increased public and political awareness is likely to translate into sustained levels of enforcement activity by multiple regulators and potentially protracted litigation in multiple jurisdictions.","Considerable uncertainty about approaches and priorities of regulators and of courts remains as the legal systems of countries around the world race to catch up with rapid technological advances. However, it is possible to put in place plans to minimise the extent to which misuse may occur and to respond appropriately if it does. The current inquiries may provide a guide to the areas which businesses making and updating such plans should prioritise when seeking to identify and mitigate the risks associated with the ways in which they use and share data.","THE ALLEGATIONS","Cambridge Analytica (CA) is alleged to have misused personal information from the Facebook profiles of approximately 87 million US voters without their authorisation. The information included names, locations, email addresses and details of \"likes\". It was gathered through a personality app accessed through Facebook by approximately 270,000 individuals. Their data and that of their Facebook friends was then used to build a system that could target them with personalised political advertisements during the 2016 US presidential election. Some press reports allege that the same conduct has been replicated in polls in other countries.","Facebook's platform policy at that time allowed friends' data to be used, but only for the purpose of improving the Facebook user experience. The policy stipulated that information was not to be sold or used for advertising. Facebook is alleged to have become aware in 2015 that individuals' data were being used in this way, but to have failed to tell users about how the information was being used and to have taken only limited steps to recover or secure the information of those affected. Facebook has claimed that no data breach occurred, but rather that CA improperly received and used the data against its terms of service.","WHO OWNS INDIVIDUALS' ONLINE DATA?","Individuals' online data belong to them. Social media companies generally make it clear in their terms of service that individuals own all of the content and information posted on their networks and control how that information is then shared. The individual also has the freedom to choose to open, close or delete any social media account he or she owns.","Whilst an individual may \"own\" his or her online data, by virtue of signing up to a social network and agreeing to the terms of service on sign-up, he or she gives various permissions to use their online data for a variety of purposes (such as advertising).","Although there is often an express limit on the use of the online data within a network's terms of service, the question of whether the individual gives implied consent on sign-up is a contentious issue.","DO SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES NEED TO INFORM INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY ARE SHARING THEIR DATA?","Most social media companies share user data with third party companies and will often operate partner programmes for this very purpose. Until GDPR comes into effect in May 2018, it is enough for social media companies simply to state how they will share individuals' data (usually within a privacy notice, policy or terms of service agreement). However, under GDPR, consent to process and use an individual's data can no longer be implied. As such, consent merely by agreeing to an operator's terms of service on sign-up will no longer be enough. Companies will not be permitted to bundle GDPR-standard consents with provisions dealing with other matters. They will have to put in place measures enabling consent to be withdrawn as easily as it is given. Consent must be unambiguous to be effective.","Many companies seek to position their data processing activity as being in their \"legitimate business interests\". In the social media context, it may well be the case that sharing data is in an organisation's legitimate interests (for example, to enhance the quality of service provided to a user). However, companies taking this approach have to weigh up their business interests against the risks to individuals' privacy rights. In order to minimise their exposure to costly litigation and enforcement action, they must be able to show that careful consideration has been given to these competing factors and that the assessment of them has been appropriately documented.","In any event, GDPR requires the business to ensure that individuals are informed about data sharing practices before their information is shared. Based on the litigation and regulatory investigations already commenced for alleged misuse of data, the potential costs can be very significant, even where the allegations remain to be proven. Recent events are likely to prompt social media companies to include even more prominent privacy reminders and expand online privacy notices.","WHAT ARE INDIVIDUALS' RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THEIR ONLINE DATA?","GDPR strengthens individuals' rights over their \"personal data\" (which means any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier - such as name, identification number, location data or any online identifier). In particular, individuals can require those holding their personal data to:","delete the data where there is no compelling reason for continued processing - this \"right to be forgotten\" has previously been recognised by the EU Courts but is now codified. It extends to a third party handling data on their behalf and requires them to erase links to, and copies or replications of, the personal data in question.","provide individuals with a copy of the information an organisation holds about them, the reasons why this information is being processed, details of whether the information will be given to any other organisations or persons and, where available, the source of the data - the time limits for doing so have been shortened and fees abolished.","transfer their personal data back to them in a downloadable, structured and machine-readable format.","There is no equivalent to GDPR in the US and no comprehensive set of privacy protections for the collection, storage and use of personal information. Instead, these requirements are imposed through contractual documents such as terms of service and privacy policies. There are some relevant protections in state law and some additional requirements imposed in certain industries such as financial services and healthcare, although none are as comprehensive as GDPR. The absence of a defined legal framework in the US on these issues increases the level of risk for the business community given the availability of numerous civil remedies (for example, breach of contract, negligence and fraud) and the readiness of US claimants to pursue them; and is compounded by the extensive extraterritorial reach of GDPR.","Recent events are likely to move large numbers of individuals concerned to exercise their rights, whether to prevent future misuse or to explore whether they may have claims against social media companies or other businesses involved in the processing of personal data. The volume and complexity of complaints may present significant practical issues. Now that these issues are firmly in the public domain, the press, politicians and enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions are likely closely to scrutinise the speed and completeness of companies' responses. Delays or any perceived lack of transparency are likely to generate negative publicity and may lead to separate, more forceful, action by investigating authorities and by the courts.","WHAT ARE THE LEGAL LIMITS ON HOW THIRD PARTIES MAY USE INDIVIDUALS' DATA?","Much depends upon documents such as the terms of service and privacy policies to which social media users sign up. For example, Facebook's publicly available data privacy policy appears to permit Facebook to share certain non-personally identifiable information (meaning data that does not include an email address or financial information) with third party advertising analytics vendors and technical infrastructure providers subject to strict confidentiality obligations.","However, there are some legal restrictions, which are set to be expanded under GDPR. Existing EU data protection rules set out the conditions by which personal data should be processed. These rules also impose additional controls on the processing of 'sensitive personal data'. This includes data concerning, for example, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious and philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health or sex life. Processing of this type of sensitive data requires explicit consent in addition to meeting the conditions for processing.","GDPR will also enhance current rules on profiling and the use of automated decision-making techniques to make decisions which have a legal effect on individuals or otherwise significantly affect them. For social media companies, this will represent a significant shift from what used to be considered industry practice.","WHERE AND HOW MIGHT CLAIMS BE PURSUED IN RESPECT OF THE MISUSE OF DATA?","On both sides of the Atlantic, claimant lawyers are gearing up for action. Information provided to social media companies rapidly crosses national borders, giving potential claimants considerable flexibility to choose where to pursue claims. Various procedural mechanisms enabling claimants to join forces, the ready availability of litigation funding and a comparatively claimant-friendly disclosure regime could make the English Courts an attractive forum. Claimants may also seek to take advantage of particular features of other legal systems, such as that of the Netherlands, where there are established mechanisms allowing consumer organisations and other interest groups to claim declaratory or injunctive relief on behalf of injured parties and its \"opt-out\" certification of damages in class settlements.","In broadly analogous decisions decided to date, English judges have shown some willingness to provide data subjects affected by the misuse of private information with a remedy, through claims for misuse of private information, breach of confidence and/or breaches of EU data protection legislation. In particular, they have recognised that \"damage\" in the relevant EU directive includes non-pecuniary damage for distressing invasions of privacy, and that compensation would be recoverable for any damage suffered following a data breach. There has not though yet been a major decided case clarifying their approach to how such damages should be calculated.","In future litigation, we expect a particular focus on any investigation reports or preliminary findings as to the cause of a data breach, given that they are likely to be fertile material for claimants seeking to bolster their claims.","GDPR expressly contemplates civil litigation against data controllers and processers. It provides for compensation for data subjects who have suffered \"material or non-material damage\" as a result of a breach. It also contemplates consumer protection bodies bringing claims on subjects' behalf. This increases the prospect of a proliferation of civil litigation on these matters.","In the US, investors and users have already filed class actions based variously on allegations that Facebook breached its own data privacy policies and California’s Unfair Competition Law by making materially false and misleading statements. Other users may attempt to bring a breach of contract claim for violations of Terms of Service and Privacy Policies. The prospects of such claims succeeding will be highly fact sensitive but claimants are likely to encounter some difficulties in establishing that they have suffered an economic loss as the result of the use of their data. Nevertheless, the risk that such litigation creates for those alleged to have misused personal date is acute.","WHICH INVESTIGATING AUTHORITIES SHOULD BUSINESSES BE CONCERNED ABOUT?","To date, the allegations against CA and Facebook have sparked investigations by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Both the ICO and the FTC are enforcement authorities whose remits include investigating and taking action in respect of breaches, data protection, and privacy. In the US, numerous state Attorneys General may open separate investigations. In addition, the UK Electoral Commission has commenced an investigation looking into possible data misuse in connection with the 2016 Brexit referendum.","The ICO has a relatively narrow remit to investigate and take action in respect of breaches of data protection and privacy legislation. Its investigative and enforcement powers, resources and ability to impose penalties have historically been quite limited compared to other enforcement agencies. Fines imposed have not been of the same order of magnitude as those imposed on businesses for other types of misconduct. However, its powers, and its confidence in using them, are expanding and it is notable that the ICO has shown a willingness to use its criminal investigation powers to secure access to material (and has adopted a high profile approach when doing so).","The FTC has sought to hold companies accountable for breached cyber defences and other violations based on its general authority to monitor \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce'' under Section 5 of the FTC Act. FTC claims are generally premised on misleading advertising or disclosure. Facebook and the FTC entered into a settlement in 2011 which required Facebook to obtain consent prior to sharing consumer information beyond the scope permitted by a user's privacy settings. If the FTC determines that the settlement was violated, Facebook could be liable for as much as $40,000 per violation, which could lead to a significant penalty if 87 million users were affected.","In the US, states have been at the forefront of privacy and consumer protection and have been aggressive in the enforcement area. State Attorneys General can pursue an enforcement action if they determine there are violations of the rights of consumers in their state. Already, Attorneys General in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania have made public statements regarding Facebook's conduct and may open investigations.","In addition to enforcement action, US and UK legislators are taking a keen interest in the allegations and have already summoned senior Facebook and CA executives to appear before them. UK Parliamentary Select Committees and their US Congressional counterparts have wide ranging powers to investigate. Proceedings before such bodies often involve organisations and senior individuals within them being strongly criticised not only for breaches of law and regulatory requirements but also on the basis of highly subjective ethical judgements. As other businesses have found to their cost, injudicious testimony before these bodies can lead to substantial reputational damage.","At present, the focus of inquiries is on social media companies and political consultants. However, data are also harvested, exchanged, sold and purchased in all manner of commercial contexts. As a consequence of the current allegations against CA and Facebook, other regulators and enforcement authorities will develop an interest in the way in which data is obtained and used by organisations in the areas for which they are responsible and more generally. Politicians will turn their attention to the extent to which data sharing (and potentially misuse) pervades the business operations of other types of organisations. Examples of scenarios where organisations' conduct may include the use of data obtained by banks and insurance companies in the course of transactions carried out for or with individuals and the sharing and use of information about customers and their habits and preferences obtained by retailers through loyalty programmes.","HOW SHOULD BUSINESSES REACT TO ALLEGATIONS OF SUSPECTED DATA MISUSE?","Many more details will emerge from the investigations concerning Facebook, CA and whichever organisations are the next targets of public, political and regulatory scrutiny. For now, it is telling that a major focus of the reputational (and therefore the very real financial) impact upon Facebook has been what it knew about the way in which individuals' data were being used, and when. There will be continued focus on whether Facebook adequately investigated the position or whether it denied the allegations for too long.","In the interests of getting to the bottom of the facts and responding to law enforcement agencies, governments, stakeholders and the public, it is tempting for businesses to rush into commencing an internal investigation. However, before doing so, it is critical to give careful consideration to the objectives and scope of any investigation.","A credible and thorough investigation can be an effective tool in reducing public backlash, investor withdrawal, regulatory/government scrutiny and potential censure, fine or conviction. However, an investigation can also create risks for the company which, with careful thought, can be mitigated (although probably not eliminated).","In some jurisdictions, facts uncovered by an internal investigation may not be protected by legal professional privilege, with the result that those facts may be disclosable to enforcement agencies and future civil litigants. They also run the risk of enforcement agencies alleging that the company has \"trampled the crime scene\" where, for example, data have been extracted in a non-forensic way or employees have been interviewed for their first accounts of what happened. In order to manage these risks and maximise the benefits of any investigation, scoping an investigation properly and early engagement with lawyers (and, in some cases, with law enforcement agencies) is essential.","Investigating agencies quickly get on top of the facts. They have access to large amounts of information, sometimes more information than the company under investigation itself. It is therefore essential to gain an early understanding of the expectations of each enforcement agency involved and the scope of their powers and propensity to cooperate with other agencies.","Conduct under investigation can generate significant parallel – or follow on - civil litigation. From a practical perspective, this can create challenges in terms of resources as companies can be fighting legal battles on several fronts at the same time. Where the litigation is occurring in parallel with any investigation, it can create tensions and risks that need to be carefully managed. It may be possible – although it can be difficult and not automatic – to obtain a stay of the civil proceedings whilst any criminal investigation takes its course. A company under investigation which anticipates follow-on litigation will also have to make decisions about the scope of any investigation since, as noted above, in certain jurisdictions the product of the investigation may not be protected by legal professional privilege.","Investigations, whether they are carried out by organisations themselves, their lawyers or enforcement agencies, are typically long and complex. Even where allegations have not yet been made or details of the matters being examined do not explode into the public domain at the outset, there is an ever present risk that they may do so. This necessitates careful contingency planning and an ability to respond nimbly and credibly to allegations. Commercial interests and reputations must be protected as far as possible whilst still demonstrating to investors, customers, staff and the wider world that matters are being taken seriously and legitimate concerns acted upon. As may turn out to be the case in this instance, what businesses do (or do not do) in the hours and days following allegations usually lives just as long in the memories of key stakeholders as the eventual outcome of investigations."],"isopubdate":""}

Earlier today, Damian Collins, a member of parliament who is the chair of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport select committee in the UK, issued a request to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to provide oral evidence to the committee. Meanwhile, Mark Warner, the U.S. Senator who is vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, has also requested that Zuckerberg, along with other tech CEOs, testify in order to answer questions about Facebook’s role in “social manipulation” in the 2016 election.","Meanwhile, Bloomberg is also reporting that the Federal Trade Commission is opening a probe into Facebook and the misuse of personal data, related to a consent decree that was issued in 2011 over the social network’s personal data handling policies.","The FTC said it could not comment on any probe, but it hinted that past precedence, involving Google, indicating that violations of consent decrees are taken seriously and investigated.","“We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,” it said in a statement a spokesperson provided to TechCrunch. “We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving Google.”","“We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have,” Rob Sherman, Deputy Chief Privacy Officer of Facebook, said in response to the report.","The original decree was made as a settlement to an inquiry at the time into how Facebook — then just a startup but growing wildly fast — “deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,” and it arose specifically in relation to how third-party apps were able to use and access this data. This is key because the original survey that users filled out was, in fact, an app of sorts, linking into Facebook by way of its API.","The idea behind the FTC settlement in 2011 was to ensure that Facebook made its privacy and data handling policies clear to consumers going forward, and to get their “express consent” before information is shared beyond the privacy settings those users established.","Specific details of the 2011 decree included barring Facebook from making misrepresentations about privacy and security of personal information; getting user consent before making change that override privacy preferences; preventing material to be shared after an account was deleted or deactivated; and maintaining a privacy program assessing risks and getting this audited every two years.","The decree also notes that it will terminate 20 years from the date of being issued, but that it will renew for another 20 years each time that the FTC files a complaint over any violations — meaning, if the FTC does file a complaint and is successful in determining the violation, it will prolong Facebook’s own need to report and make clear privacy policies to its users.","Policians call on Zuck to answer for the company","The trio of calls from government representatives asking for Zuckerberg to make an appearance himself to discuss the role of Facebook is notable not least because it is coming from so many places at once — a loud chorus that may well finally provide the pressure needed to see the executive come out from behind his status updates.","To be clear, Warner’s public call for Zuckerberg to speak, delivered earlier this morning by way of a Tweet, was not the first time that the Intel Committee has requested Zuckerberg to testify: it had also invited him to the original hearing in November of last year, where lawyers were sent instead.","It's time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other CEOs to testify before Congress. The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election.","Meanwhile, Collins’ invitation also comes in the wake of other requests for top Facebook executives, for hearings that the DCMS has held both in London and, just weeks ago, in Washington in an attempt to attract more senior executives to participate.","“The Committtee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent,” Collins writes in his letter. “Your officials’ answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the Committee. It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process.”","Facebook has until March 26 to respond to the invitation.","“We have received a letter from the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee and will of course respond by the given deadline,” a spokesperson said. “In the meantime, we continue to engage with the Committee and respond to their requests for information.”","Most damning of all perhaps is the call from the European Parliament president, with its note putting Facebook on the defensive from the word go, but also potentially giving the company an avenue to try to explain itself better than it has.","We’ve invited Mark Zuckerberg to the European Parliament. Facebook needs to clarify before the representatives of 500 million Europeans that personal data is not being used to manipulate democracy.","Indeed, the thinking now seems to be that the increased attention, and the revelations in the media, will now force Facebook’s hand a bit more than before.","The summons to give evidence before the parliamentary committee or Congress are not legally binding, but they are significant for other reasons.","For one, they provide a moment to hear Zuckerberg give live responses to questions as they are presented to him: up to now, a lot of what we’ve heard from the CEO on the subject of Facebook and its position in the wider issue of elections, fake news and the use of social media help achieve certain outcomes, has largely come in the form of long Facebook posts by him, with little in the way of dialogue (which is in itself a little ironic when you consider the whole point of Facebook is supposed to be about engagement).","While there are no direct legal ramifications for testifying, what it does do is provide more evidence for lawmakers. At a time when we have relatively light regulation for social media and how it handles data in the US, this could become a critical moment where we may start to see more calls and efforts to start to regulate this area of digital media more carefully.","A third reason why testifying is notable is because of the optics: for a lot of people who do not understand and care much about the intricacies of how social networks handle their data, this could bring new light to the topic, on both sides of the table.

The ads were viewed billions of times, according to the presentation.","The document was presented to Cambridge Analytica employees in London, New York and Washington DC weeks after Trump’s victory, providing an insight into how the controversial firm helped pull off one of the most dramatic political upsets in modern history.","“This is the debrief of the data-driven digital campaign that was employed for Mr Trump,” said Brittany Kaiser, 30, who was Cambridge Analytica’s business development director until two weeks ago, when she left over a contractual dispute.","She is the second former employee to come forward in less than a week, talking exclusively to the Guardian about the inner workings of the firm, including the work she said it conducted on the UK’s EU membership referendum.","She said she had access to a copy of the same document now obtained by the Guardian, and had used it to showcase the campaign’s secret methods to potential clients of Cambridge Analytica.","“There was a huge demand internally for people to see how we did it,” Kaiser said of the 2016 race. “Everyone wanted to know: past clients, future clients. The whole world wanted to see it. This is what we were allowed to confidentially show people if they signed a non-disclosure agreement.”","Kaiser claims to be committed to human rights, but many would argue her career at Cambridge Analytica tells a different story. She has worked extensively for the firm, pitching business to clients in countries that have a history of exploitation by western political mercenaries, including Lithuania, Benin, Ethiopia and Libya.","Cambridge Analytica has a reputation among political operatives for exaggerating its role in campaigns. A senior Trump campaign official who said they saw the document about a year ago claimed it took credit for some work that was done by the Republican national committee and Trump’s digital director, Brad Parscale.","Kaiser did not work on the campaign but said she gleaned information about how it was orchestrated during discussions with senior staff, including the now suspended chief executive, Alexander Nix.","Despite the advances made in data-led political campaigning, these were techniques that, according to the presentation, Trump did not have access to when Cambridge Analytica joined his campaign in early June 2016.","The Republican nominee, who had just secured sufficient delegates to become the party’s candidate, still had “no speakable data infrastructure” and “no unifying data, digital and tech strategy”, the document states.","Kaiser said Cambridge Analytica staff told her they were stunned when they arrived at Trump’s headquarters in Trump Tower, New York.","“There was no database of record. There were many disparate data sources that were not connected, matched or hygiened,” she said of the process of ordering, sorting and cleaning enormous data sets. “There was no data science programme, so they weren’t undertaking any modelling. There was no digital marketing team.”","One of the first things Cambridge Analytica did, she said, was work with data supplied by the party’s data trust and other data acquired through an initiative called Project Alamo.","The document contains very little information about how the campaign used Facebook data. One page, however, suggests Cambridge Analytica was able to constantly monitor the effectiveness of its messaging on different types of voters, giving the company and the campaign constant feedback about levels of engagement on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.","The feedback loop meant the algorithms could be constantly updated and improved to deliver thousands of different messages to voters depending on their profile.","The level of information the company could glean about voters – and the apparent appetite among Silicon Valley companies to cash in on the advertising bonanza – is illustrated on another page which shows how the Trump campaign used a prime piece of marketing real estate on election day: YouTube’s entire masthead.","Cambridge Analytica scandal: the biggest revelations so far","Read more","Kaiser said Hillary Clinton’s campaign had reserved the space on Google’s video-hosting platform but was so confident of victory that it gave it up. “Google called us and said this ad space is now available, immediately,” Kaiser said. “That’s what I was told.”","The Trump campaign seized the opportunity, showing two different ads to different categories of voters according to the detailed geographical information of visitors to the YouTube home page.","Voters in areas where people were likely to be Trump supporters were shown a triumphant-looking image of the nominee, and help finding their nearest polling station.","Those whose geographical information suggested they were not fervent Trump supporters, such as swing voters, were shown photos of his high-profile supporters, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, a celebrity from the reality TV show Duck Dynasty, and Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.","One of the most effective ads, according to Kaiser, was a piece of native advertising on the political news website Politico, which was also profiled in the presentation. The interactive graphic, which looked like a piece of journalism and purported to list “10 inconvenient truths about the Clinton Foundation”, appeared for several weeks to people from a list of key swing states when they visited the site. It was produced by the in-house Politico team that creates sponsored content.","The Cambridge Analytica presentation dedicates an entire slide to the ad, which is described as having achieved “an average engagement time of four minutes”. Kaiser described the ad as “the most successful thing we pushed out”.","Politico said editorial journalists were not involved in the campaign, and similar ads were purchased by the Bernie Sanders and Clinton campaigns.","Advertisements on Facebook, Twitter, Google and the music-sharing app Pandora were used to help convince 35,000 supporters to install an app used by the most active supporters.","According to the presentation, Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign also used a new advertising technique offered by Twitter, launched at the start of the election year, which enabled clients to kickstart viral tweets.","The “conversational ads” feature was used to encourage Trump’s followers to tweet using a set of pre-determined hashtags.","One of the final slides explains how the company used paid-for Google ads to implement “persuasion search advertising”, to push pro-Trump and anti-Clinton search results through the company’s main search facility.","One slide showed how the company ensured that voters searching the words “Trump Iraq War” would encounter paid-for search results that were favourable to his campaign. “Control The First Impression,” the slide says, with an arrow pointing to a search result that states: “Hillary Voted for the Iraq War – Donald Trump opposed it.”","“That’s a Google manipulation thing,” Kaiser said, adding that while a “general person” probably did not know how easy it was to pay for ads to appear high in Google search results, it was considered “an old-school tactic” in her industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

{"originalurl":"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601214/how-political-candidates-know-if-youre-neurotic/","title":"How Political Candidates Know If You’re Neurotic - MIT Technology Review","text":["Why we made this change","Visitors are allowed 3 free articles per month (without a subscription), and private browsing prevents us from counting how many stories you've read. We hope you understand, and consider subscribing for unlimited online access.","How Political Candidates Know If You’re Neurotic","The latest data-driven campaign pitches target you based on your personality, not just your demographics. But does such profiling work?","When a state representative named Thom Tillis ran for U.S. Senate in North Carolina in 2014, his campaign followed the now-standard practice of sending voters online and direct-mail advertisements referring to particular issues. Which issues mattered to which people, from ISIS to the Affordable Care Act, could be gleaned from the voters’ memberships and donations or inferred from demographic information and databases of everything from their purchases to their Web history.","Thing Reviewed","But some of Tillis’s advertisements tried something new. One, which showed Tillis smiling broadly with a soft-focus background of green foliage, promised he’d “restore common sense in Washington.” Another, featuring a man wearing a hard hat while poring over blueprints with his team, asserted that Tillis had “the experience to get the economy working.” A third showed the camouflage-smeared face of a soldier and contained this promise from Tillis: “Your safety is his top priority.”","Which version went to whom depended on how the Tillis campaign assessed the recipient’s personality. The grinning picture? That went to people who tended to be “agreeable.” Hard hat? That one was aimed at people deemed “conscientious.” Soldier? That one was reserved for people thought “neurotic.”","Are you someone who worries? Has a vivid imagination? Trusts others?","The Tillis campaign made the ads with help from Cambridge Analytica—an offshoot of a British firm called SCL Group, which has long been involved in campaigns (commercial, political, military) that leverage behavioral-science research. Like other big-data analysis companies, it categorizes voters on the basis of demographics and issues, but it appears to be the first to add personality typing to the mix. The company says it has assessed the personalities of all 190 million registered voters in the United States. “We can now start to really look at people based on their psychographics, not just their demographics,” says Alex Tayler, chief data officer at Cambridge Analytica’s headquarters in London.","It’s a fairly new approach, and no published data shows that what Cambridge Analytica is doing adds any real value. “Many basic categories of data tend to be very predictive in terms of voting habits: voting history, party registration, age, gender, race, marital status, presence of children, and some basic census measures,” says Daniel Kreiss, a professor of political communication at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “Everything else gives you only marginal potential advantages. Is personality the strongest predictor of whether someone is persuadable versus any of these other things? I haven’t seen any data that has suggested that this form of modeling does or doesn’t work.”","The “Big Five” TraitsIf you rank high in …","OpennessYou are intellectually curious and tend to think and act in individualistic and nonconforming ways.","ConscientiousnessYou set clear goals and are reliable, organized, and self-controlled.","ExtroversionYou enjoy being with other people, are full of energy, and tend to seek out opportunities for excitement.","AgreeablenessYou value getting along with others and believe people are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy.","NeuroticismYou tend to experience negative feelings and to interpret ordinary situations as threatening.","In fact, there are large gaps in our understanding about many kinds of data-driven campaigning, says Gregory Huber, a political scientist at Yale. In 2012, President Obama’s campaign operatives analyzed data about individual voters’ issue preferences and demographics to craft messages tailored to them (see “A More Perfect Union,” January/February 2013). Obama won reëlection, but did the microtargeted persuasion efforts have anything to do with it? “There is almost nothing known about whether that stuff worked or not,” says Huber. “There are books written that are descriptive exercises of what the campaign was doing. But in terms of a valid, unbiased, randomized assessment of its effectiveness, I don’t think we know much at all.”","Nonetheless, academic research has established a relationship between personality and political leanings—and has found that some types of personalities are more persuadable than others. Such basic research doesn’t necessarily translate into a practical campaign strategy, but it does suggest that personality typing might provide something that demographics alone can’t. And it is tantalizing enough to persuade some campaigns to give Cambridge Analytica’s tools a try. The company, which represents Republican and conservative candidates, worked on 44 state and federal races in the United States in 2014. This year it has worked for the presidential campaign of Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas.","Are you agreeable?","Cambridge Analytica’s technology attempts to define a voter’s predominant personality type—adding this to the list of things campaigns know about you. But while the microtargeting is new, the basic concepts about personality are old. In the past three decades, disparate research groups have identified a set of basic personality traits. Often called the “Big Five,” they can be summarized by the acronym “OCEAN”: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Classification is typically done through questionnaires. Among the typical questions: Are you someone who worries about things? Makes friends easily? Has a vivid imagination? Trusts others? Completes tasks successfully? And so on.","Here’s how the company does it: Cambridge Analytica administers such questionnaires online, promoting them using ads that promise to tell you the relative weight of your personality traits. The company says it has used these tests to “harvest” the personalities of several hundred thousand Americans. Even if you haven’t taken one of its tests, the company categorizes you by extrapolating. It concludes that you tend to be, say, agreeable or neurotic by matching statistical profiles made up of as many as 5,000 commercially or publicly available data points about you to the statistical profiles of people who actually took the personality tests and came out as agreeable or neurotic and so on. (It will not discuss the particulars of these statistical matches but says the data come from consumer database companies including Acxiom, Experian, Infogroup, and Aristotle, as well as the Republican Party’s voter file.)","By this means, Cambridge Analytica claims to have acquired a rough sense of the personalities of much of the U.S. population. Assuming the method is accurate, your personality type then provides an extra layer of information about you, atop the demographics and other information campaigns and their consultants already use. The result could be an ad geared toward your agreeable personality, even if you are demographically quite similar to the neurotic guy next door.","When this information is shared with political candidates, their campaigns can devise and test ads in small groups to see which ones are effective. To serve individual ads online, Cambridge Analytica uses the standard marketing practice of matching its data to cookies—small pieces of data that track your computer’s visits to websites—using third-party services like Acxiom that merge online and offline data about you. In addition, Facebook serves as a major platform for targeted ads. While Facebook says it does not provide data that could reveal your personality, it will display customized ads to lists of individuals provided by a political campaign. Finally, not all of the targeted messaging occurs online; some campaigns mail customized ads to voters’ homes.","Too much information","A large and growing body of research shows that personality traits predict a wide array of behaviors, financial decisions, and happiness levels in jobs and relationships. When it comes to politics, research at the University of Toronto and the University of Minnesota has found that people with “openness” as a major trait tend to favor liberal candidates, while people who scored relatively high on “conscientiousness” tend to be more conservative.","Your personality also probably plays at least some role in your overall susceptibility to persuasion—a valuable thing for a political campaign to know. Several years ago a group of political scientists at Yale University and other institutions found that social pressure could encourage people to vote. If voters were presented with information detailing which of their neighbors had voted—and were told that their own record of showing up at the polls might be similarly publicized—they were far more likely to go to the polls. (The fact that you voted—but not for whom you voted—is public information.) People who scored high on “emotional stability” and “openness” responded more strongly to this social pressure.","The ad voters received from Thom Tillis’s 2014 Senate campaign in North Carolina depended on whether the campaign thought the recipient was conscientious, neurotic, or agreeable.","So if you wanted to devise a campaign that used social pressure to get your supporters out to vote but had finite resources to do it, it would make sense to focus on reaching people you suspected had personalities characterized by emotional stability and openness, says Huber, who cowrote the study.","At the same time, there’s reason to wonder if we’ve reached the limit of what data analytics can actually achieve by microtargeting individual voters. Campaigns have plenty of methods to experiment with: as of 2012, by Kreiss’s count, technology and data-science staffers on presidential campaigns had founded 67 companies to work for Democrats and another 13 for Republicans. But the campaigns may be getting overconfident in what algorithms can really do.","“The problem with data analytics and all these models is that they all look backwards, not forward,” says Micah Sifry, cofounder of Personal Democracy Media, which produces the annual Personal Democracy Forum conference on how technology is changing politics. “The best thing they can do is offer you a prediction on what people are likely to do based on what they did in response to stimuli in the past.”","In this election year, filled with fast-changing trends and unpredictable candidates, that dependence on past behaviors and basic personality types could be an unreliable way to gauge a person’s political preferences. Maybe we need to add another distinguishing trait to match with voters: anger.","Credit","I’m MIT Technology Review’s senior writer, interested in a wide range of topics including climate change, energy, and information and communication technologies.

But the data came from someone who didn’t hack the system: a professor who originally told Facebook he wanted it for academic purposes.","He set up a personality quiz using tools that let people log in with their Facebook accounts, then asked them to sign over access to their friend lists and likes before using the app. The 270,000 users of that app and their friend networks opened up private data on 50 million people, according to the New York Times. All of that was allowed under Facebook’s rules, until the professor handed the information off to a third party.","Facebook said it found out about Cambridge Analytica’s access in 2015, after which it had the firm certify that it deleted the data. On Friday, Facebook said it now knows Cambridge actually kept it – an infraction that got Cambridge suspended from the social network. Once that was announced, executives quickly moved on to defending Facebook’s security.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said on Twitter. “People chose to share their data with third-party apps and if those third-party apps did not follow the agreements with us/users it is a violation.” Alex Stamos, Facebook’s head of security, echoed the same arguments. Cambridge denied doing anything illegal or using the information in the 2016 presidential election; Facebook says it has no way of knowing how or whether the data was used for targeting in the Trump campaign.","Facebook’s advertising business depends on users sharing their most personal data via its social network. But the company’s “not a breach” argument isn’t likely to make users feel any safer or more comfortable doing so – especially given that it’s already under fire for missing that Russian actors were purchasing US election ads on the site to sway voter opinions, as well as running fake accounts disguised as real Americans. The company has also been fending off accusations that it’s too slow to notice or react to harmful content.","UK inquiry","The latest incident has raised new questions about what technical guardrails Facebook has in place to prevent authorised users from sharing sensitive information, and how much visibility the company has into how outsiders use the data.","Facebook wouldn’t comment on those questions, saying only that it has made significant improvements in its ability to “detect and prevent violations” by app developers, such as random audits of applications using its tools to make sure they’re following the rules. And it’s no longer letting developers who use Facebook’s login tools see information on their users’ friends.","The disclosure of Facebook’s actions also underscores it’s continuing struggle to anticipate negative consequences of its lack of oversight – in some cases taking action only after things go wrong. The company in the past two years has worked to understand and counteract the spread of misinformation on its site, the use of its automated advertising system for racist targeting, the proliferation of fake user accounts, the spread of violent video, and more.","But when the company tries to explain what it’s doing, it grapples with the perception that it’s shirking responsibility for its problems, treating them as public-relations snafus instead of serious product flaws.","Stamos, the Facebook security executive, deleted his original tweets on Cambridge Analytica, saying he wasn’t so good at “talking about these things in the reality of 2018.” Specifically, he said he didn’t know how to balance his personal beliefs with his responsibility to Facebook and his co-workers, amid all the criticism.","“We have collectively been too optimistic about what we build and our impact on the world,” Stamos wrote Saturday on Twitter. “Believe it or not, a lot of the people at these companies, from the interns to the CEOs, agree.”","Lawmakers in the US and UK aren’t convinced Facebook has its users’ best interests in mind. Over the weekend the company faced critiques from members of the Senate intelligence committee, and in London, the head of a parliamentary committee called on CEO Mark Zuckerberg to have a senior executive answer those questions.","“We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Damian Collins, chair of the UK Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee, said in a statement. “Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee.” — Bloomberg"],"isopubdate":""}

The BBC was “another beauty”.","That night I did two things. First, I typed “Trump” in the search box of Twitter. My feed was reporting that he was crazy, a lunatic, a raving madman.

In the “About us” tab, I learn CNSnews is owned by the Media Research Center, which a click later I learn is “America’s media watchdog”, an organisation that claims an “unwavering commitment to neutralising leftwing bias in the news, media and popular culture”.","Another couple of clicks and I discover that it receives a large bulk of its funding – more than $10m in the past decade – from a single source, the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. If you follow US politics you may recognise the name. Robert Mercer is the money behind Donald Trump. But then, I will come to learn, Robert Mercer is the money behind an awful lot of things. He was Trump’s single biggest donor. Mercer started backing Ted Cruz, but when he fell out of the presidential race he threw his money – $13.5m of it – behind the Trump campaign.","It’s money he’s made as a result of his career as a brilliant but reclusive computer scientist. He started his career at IBM, where he made what the Association for Computational Linguistics called “revolutionary” breakthroughs in language processing – a science that went on to be key in developing today’s AI – and later became joint CEO of Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund that makes its money by using algorithms to model and trade on the financial markets.","One of its funds, Medallion, which manages only its employees’ money, is the most successful in the world – generating $55bn so far. And since 2010, Mercer has donated $45m to different political campaigns – all Republican – and another $50m to non-profits – all rightwing, ultra-conservative. This is a billionaire who is, as billionaires are wont, trying to reshape the world according to his personal beliefs.","Robert Mercer very rarely speaks in public and never to journalists, so to gauge his beliefs you have to look at where he channels his money: a series of yachts, all called Sea Owl; a $2.9m model train set; climate change denial (he funds a climate change denial thinktank, the Heartland Institute); and what is maybe the ultimate rich man’s plaything – the disruption of the mainstream media. In this he is helped by his close associate Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign manager and now chief strategist. The money he gives to the Media Research Center, with its mission of correcting “liberal bias” is just one of his media plays. There are other bigger, and even more deliberate strategies, and shining brightly, the star at the centre of the Mercer media galaxy, is Breitbart.","It was $10m of Mercer’s money that enabled Bannon to fund Breitbart – a rightwing news site, set up with the express intention of being a Huffington Post for the right. It has launched the careers of Milo Yiannopoulos and his like, regularly hosts antisemitic and Islamophobic views, and is currently being boycotted by more than 1,000 brands after an activist campaign. It has been phenomenally successful: the 29th most popular site in America with 2bn page views a year. It’s bigger than its inspiration, the Huffington Post, bigger, even, than PornHub. It’s the biggest political site on Facebook. The biggest on Twitter.","Prominent rightwing journalist Andrew Breitbart, who founded the site but died in 2012, told Bannon that they had “to take back the culture”. And, arguably, they have, though American culture is only the start of it. In 2014, Bannon launched Breitbart London, telling the New York Times it was specifically timed ahead of the UK’s forthcoming election. It was, he said, the latest front “in our current cultural and political war”. France and Germany are next.","A determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can, and have, found a way to mould journalism to their own ends","But there was another reason why I recognised Robert Mercer’s name: because of his connection to Cambridge Analytica, a small data analytics company. He is reported to have a $10m stake in the company, which was spun out of a bigger British company called SCL Group. It specialises in “election management strategies” and “messaging and information operations”, refined over 25 years in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. In military circles this is known as “psyops” – psychological operations. (Mass propaganda that works by acting on people’s emotions.)","Cambridge Analytica worked for the Trump campaign and, so I’d read, the Leave campaign. When Mercer supported Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with Cruz. When Robert Mercer started supporting Trump, Cambridge Analytica came too. And where Mercer’s money is, Steve Bannon is usually close by: it was reported that until recently he had a seat on the board.","Last December, I wrote about Cambridge Analytica in a piece about how Google’s search results on certain subjects were being dominated by rightwing and extremist sites. Jonathan Albright, a professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, who had mapped the news ecosystem and found millions of links between rightwing sites “strangling” the mainstream media, told me that trackers from sites like Breitbart could also be used by companies like Cambridge Analytica to follow people around the web and then, via Facebook, target them with ads.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica makes the astonishing boast that it has psychological profiles based on 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters – its USP is to use this data to understand people’s deepest emotions and then target them accordingly. The system, according to Albright, amounted to a “propaganda machine”.","A few weeks later, the Observer received a letter. Cambridge Analytica was not employed by the Leave campaign, it said. Cambridge Analytica “is a US company based in the US. It hasn’t worked in British politics.”","Which is how, earlier this week, I ended up in a Pret a Manger near Westminster with Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s affable communications director, looking at snapshots of Donald Trump on his phone. It was Wigmore who orchestrated Nigel Farage’s trip to Trump Tower – the PR coup that saw him become the first foreign politician to meet the president elect.","Wigmore scrolls through the snaps on his phone. “That’s the one I took,” he says pointing at the now globally famous photo of Farage and Trump in front of his golden elevator door giving the thumbs-up sign. Wigmore was one of the “bad boys of Brexit” – a term coined by Arron Banks, the Bristol-based businessman who was Leave.EU’s co-founder.","Cambridge Analytica had worked for them, he said. It had taught them how to build profiles, how to target people and how to scoop up masses of data from people’s Facebook profiles. A video on YouTube shows one of Cambridge Analytica’s and SCL’s employees, Brittany Kaiser, sitting on the panel at Leave.EU’s launch event.","Facebook was the key to the entire campaign, Wigmore explained. A Facebook ‘like’, he said, was their most “potent weapon”. “Because using artificial intelligence, as we did, tells you all sorts of things about that individual and how to convince them with what sort of advert. And you knew there would also be other people in their network who liked what they liked, so you could spread. And then you follow them. The computer never stops learning and it never stops monitoring.”","“It is creepy! It’s really creepy! It’s why I’m not on Facebook! I tried it on myself to see what information it had on me and I was like, ‘Oh my God!’ What’s scary is that my kids had put things on Instagram and it picked that up. It knew where my kids went to school.”","They hadn’t “employed” Cambridge Analytica, he said. No money changed hands. “They were happy to help.”","Why?","“Because Nigel is a good friend of the Mercers. And Robert Mercer introduced them to us. He said, ‘Here’s this company we think may be useful to you.’ What they were trying to do in the US and what we were trying to do had massive parallels. We shared a lot of information. Why wouldn’t you?” Behind Trump’s campaign and Cambridge Analytica, he said, were “the same people. It’s the same family.”","There were already a lot of questions swirling around Cambridge Analytica, and Andy Wigmore has opened up a whole lot more. Such as: are you supposed to declare services-in-kind as some sort of donation? The Electoral Commission says yes, if it was more than £7,500. And was it declared? The Electoral Commission says no. Does that mean a foreign billionaire had possibly influenced the referendum without that influence being apparent? It’s certainly a question worth asking.","In the last month or so, articles in first the Swiss and the US press have asked exactly what Cambridge Analytica is doing with US voters’ data. In a statement to the Observer, the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “Any business collecting and using personal data in the UK must do so fairly and lawfully. We will be contacting Cambridge Analytica and asking questions to find out how the company is operating in the UK and whether the law is being followed.”","Cambridge Analytica said last Friday they are in touch with the ICO and are completely compliant with UK and EU data laws. It did not answer other questions the Observer put to it this week about how it built its psychometric model, which owes its origins to original research carried out by scientists at Cambridge University’s Psychometric Centre, research based on a personality quiz on Facebook that went viral. More than 6 million people ended up doing it, producing an astonishing treasure trove of data.","These Facebook profiles – especially people’s “likes” – could be correlated across millions of others to produce uncannily accurate results. Michal Kosinski, the centre’s lead scientist, found that with knowledge of 150 likes, their model could predict someone’s personality better than their spouse. With 300, it understood you better than yourself. “Computers see us in a more robust way than we see ourselves,” says Kosinski.","But there are strict ethical regulations regarding what you can do with this data. Did SCL Group have access to the university’s model or data, I ask Professor Jonathan Rust, the centre’s director? “Certainly not from us,” he says. “We have very strict rules around this.”","A scientist, Aleksandr Kogan, from the centre was contracted to build a model for SCL, and says he collected his own data. Professor Rust says he doesn’t know where Kogan’s data came from. “The evidence was contrary. I reported it.” An independent adjudicator was appointed by the university. “But then Kogan said he’d signed a non-disclosure agreement with SCL and he couldn’t continue [answering questions].”","Kogan disputes this and says SCL satisfied the university’s inquiries. But perhaps more than anyone, Professor Rust understands how the kind of information people freely give up to social media sites could be used.","Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is a friend of the Mercers. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images","“The danger of not having regulation around the sort of data you can get from Facebook and elsewhere is clear. With this, a computer can actually do psychology, it can predict and potentially control human behaviour. It’s what the scientologists try to do but much more powerful. It’s how you brainwash someone. It’s incredibly dangerous.","“It’s no exaggeration to say that minds can be changed. Behaviour can be predicted and controlled. I find it incredibly scary. I really do. Because nobody has really followed through on the possible consequences of all this. People don’t know it’s happening to them. Their attitudes are being changed behind their backs.”","Mercer invested in Cambridge Analytica, the Washington Post reported, “driven in part by an assessment that the right was lacking sophisticated technology capabilities”. But in many ways, it’s what Cambridge Analytica’s parent company does that raises even more questions.","Emma Briant, a propaganda specialist at the University of Sheffield, wrote about SCL Group in her 2015 book, Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change. Cambridge Analytica has the technological tools to effect behavioural and psychological change, she said, but it’s SCL that strategises it. It has specialised, at the highest level – for Nato, the MoD, the US state department and others – in changing the behaviour of large groups. It models mass populations and then it changes their beliefs.","SCL was founded by someone called Nigel Oakes, who worked for Saatchi & Saatchi on Margaret Thatcher’s image, says Briant, and the company had been “making money out of the propaganda side of the war on terrorism over a long period of time. There are different arms of SCL but it’s all about reach and the ability to shape the discourse. They are trying to amplify particular political narratives. And they are selective in who they go for: they are not doing this for the left.”","In the course of the US election, Cambridge Analytica amassed a database, as it claims on its website, of almost the entire US voting population – 220 million people – and the Washington Post reported last week that SCL was increasing staffing at its Washington office and competing for lucrative new contracts with Trump’s administration. “It seems significant that a company involved in engineering a political outcome profits from what follows. Particularly if it’s the manipulation, and then resolution, of fear,” says Briant.","It’s the database, and what may happen to it, that particularly exercises Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician and data activist who has been investigating Cambridge Analytica and SCL for more than a year. “How is it going to be used?” he says. “Is it going to be used to try and manipulate people around domestic policies? Or to ferment conflict between different communities? It is potentially very scary. People just don’t understand the power of this data and how it can be used against them.”","There are two things, potentially, going on simultaneously: the manipulation of information on a mass level, and the manipulation of information at a very individual level. Both based on the latest understandings in science about how people work, and enabled by technological platforms built to bring us together.","Are we living in a new era of propaganda, I ask Emma Briant? One we can’t see, and that is working on us in ways we can’t understand? Where we can only react, emotionally, to its messages? “Definitely. The way that surveillance through technology is so pervasive, the collection and use of our data is so much more sophisticated. It’s totally covert. And people don’t realise what is going on.”","Public mood and politics goes through cycles. You don’t have to subscribe to any conspiracy theory, Briant says, to see that a mass change in public sentiment is happening. Or that some of the tools in action are straight out of the military’s or SCL’s playbook.","But then there’s increasing evidence that our public arenas – the social media sites where we post our holiday snaps or make comments about the news – are a new battlefield where international geopolitics is playing out in real time. It’s a new age of propaganda. But whose? This week, Russia announced the formation of a new branch of the military: “information warfare troops”.","Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda institute tells me that one third of all traffic on Twitter before the EU referendum was automated “bots” – accounts that are programmed to look like people, to act like people, and to change the conversation, to make topics trend. And they were all for Leave. Before the US election, they were five-to-one in favour of Trump – many of them Russian. Last week they have been in action in the Stoke byelection – Russian bots, organised by who? – attacking Paul Nuttall.","You can take a trending topic, such as fake news, and then weaponise it, turn it against the media that uncovered it","There’s nothing accidental about Trump’s behaviour, Andy Wigmore tells me. “That press conference. It was absolutely brilliant. I could see exactly what he was doing. There’s feedback going on constantly. That’s what you can do with artificial intelligence. You can measure ever reaction to every word. He has a word room, where you fix key words. We did it. So with immigration, there are actually key words within that subject matter which people are concerned about. So when you are going to make a speech, it’s all about how can you use these trending words.”","Wigmore met with Trump’s team right at the start of the Leave campaign. “And they said the holy grail was artificial intelligence.”","Who did?","“Jared Kushner and Jason Miller.”","Later, when Trump picked up Mercer and Cambridge Analytica, the game changed again. “It’s all about the emotions. This is the big difference with what we did. They call it bio-psycho-social profiling. It takes your physical, mental and lifestyle attributes and works out how people work, how they react emotionally.”","Bio-psycho-social profiling, I read later, is one offensive in what is called “cognitive warfare”. Though there are many others: “recoding the mass consciousness to turn patriotism into collaborationism,” explains a Nato briefing document on countering Russian disinformation written by an SCL employee. “Time-sensitive professional use of media to propagate narratives,” says one US state department white paper. “Of particular importance to psyop personnel may be publicly and commercially available data from social media platforms.”","Yet another details the power of a “cognitive casualty” – a “moral shock” that “has a disabling effect on empathy and higher processes such as moral reasoning and critical thinking”. Something like immigration, perhaps. Or “fake news”. Or as it has now become: “FAKE news!!!!”","How do you change the way a nation thinks? You could start by creating a mainstream media to replace the existing one with a site such as Breitbart. You could set up other websites that displace mainstream sources of news and information with your own definitions of concepts like “liberal media bias”, like CNSnews.com. And you could give the rump mainstream media, papers like the “failing New York Times!” what it wants: stories. Because the third prong of Mercer and Bannon’s media empire is the Government Accountability Institute.","Bannon co-founded it with $2m of Mercer’s money. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, was appointed to the board. Then they invested in expensive, long-term investigative journalism. “The modern economics of the newsroom don’t support big investigative reporting staffs,” Bannon told Forbes magazine. “You wouldn’t get a Watergate, a Pentagon Papers today, because nobody can afford to let a reporter spend seven months on a story. We can. We’re working as a support function.”","Welcome to the future of journalism in the age of platform capitalism. News organisations have to do a better job of creating new financial models. But in the gaps in between, a determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can, and have, found a way to mould journalism to their own ends.","In 2015, Steve Bannon described to Forbes how the GAI operated, employing a data scientist to trawl the dark web (in the article he boasts of having access to $1.3bn worth of supercomputers) to dig up the kind of source material Google can’t find. One result has been a New York Times bestseller, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, written by GAI’s president, Peter Schweizer and later turned into a film produced by Rebekah Mercer and Steve Bannon.","This, Bannon explained, is how you “weaponise” the narrative you want. With hard researched facts. With those, you can launch it straight on to the front page of the New York Times, as the story of Hillary Clinton’s cash did. Like Hillary’s emails it turned the news agenda, and, most crucially, it diverted the attention of the news cycle. Another classic psyops approach. “Strategic drowning” of other messages.","This is a strategic, long-term and really quite brilliant play. In the 1990s, Bannon explained, conservative media couldn’t take Bill Clinton down because “they wound up talking to themselves in an echo chamber”.","As, it turns out, the liberal media is now. We are scattered, separate, squabbling among ourselves and being picked off like targets in a shooting gallery. Increasingly, there’s a sense that we are talking to ourselves. And whether it’s Mercer’s millions or other factors, Jonathan Albright’s map of the news and information ecosystem shows how rightwing sites are dominating sites like YouTube and Google, bound tightly together by millions of links.","Is there a central intelligence to that, I ask Albright? “There has to be. There has to be some type of coordination. You can see from looking at the map, from the architecture of the system, that this is not accidental. It’s clearly being led by money and politics.”","There’s been a lot of talk in the echo chamber about Bannon in the last few months, but it’s Mercer who provided the money to remake parts of the media landscape. And while Bannon understands the media, Mercer understands big data. He understands the structure of the internet. He knows how algorithms work.","Robert Mercer did not respond to a request for comment for this piece. Nick Patterson, a British cryptographer, who worked at Renaissance Technologies in the 80s and is now a computational geneticist at MIT, described to me how he was the one who talent-spotted Mercer. “There was an elite group working at IBM in the 1980s doing speech research, speech recognition, and when I joined Renaissance I judged that the mathematics we were trying to apply to financial markets were very similar.”","Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video.\nPlease\nupgrade to a modern browser and try again.","He describes Mercer as “very, very conservative. He truly did not like the Clintons. He thought Bill Clinton was a criminal. And his basic politics, I think, was that he’s a rightwing libertarian, he wants the government out of things.”","He suspects that Mercer is bringing the brilliant computational skills he brought to finance to bear on another very different sphere. “We make mathematical models of the financial markets which are probability models, and from those we try and make predictions. What I suspect Cambridge Analytica do is that they build probability models of how people vote. And then they look at what they can do to influence that.”","Finding the edge is what quants do. They build quantitative models that automate the process of buying and selling shares and then they chase tiny gaps in knowledge to create huge wins. Renaissance Technologies was one of the first hedge funds to invest in AI. But what it does with it, how it’s been programmed to do it, is completely unknown. It is, Bloomberg reports, the “blackest box in finance”.","Johan Bollen, associate professor at Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing, tells me how he discovered one possible edge: he’s done research that shows you can predict stock market moves from Twitter. You can measure public sentiment and then model it. “Society is driven by emotions, which it’s always been difficult to measure, collectively. But there are now programmes that can read text and measure it and give us a window into those collective emotions.”","The research caused a huge ripple among two different constituencies. “We had a lot attention from hedge funds. They are looking for signals everywhere and this is a hugely interesting signal. My impression is hedge funds do have these algorithms that are scanning social feeds. The flash crashes we’ve had – sudden huge drops in stock prices – indicates these algorithms are being used at large scale. And they are engaged in something of an arms race.”","The other people interested in Bollen’s work are those who want not only to measure public sentiment, but to change it. Bollen’s research shows how it’s possible. Could you reverse engineer the national, or even the global, mood? Model it, and then change it?","“It does seem possible. And it does worry me. There are quite a few pieces of research that show if you repeat something often enough, people start involuntarily to believe it. And that could be leveraged, or weaponised for propaganda. We know there are thousands of automated bots out there that are trying to do just that.”","THE war of the bots is one of the wilder and weirder aspects of the elections of 2016. At the Oxford Internet Institute’s Unit for Computational Propaganda, its director, Phil Howard, and director of research, Sam Woolley, show me all the ways public opinion can be massaged and manipulated. But is there a smoking gun, I ask them, evidence of who is doing this? “There’s not a smoking gun,” says Howard. “There are smoking machine guns. There are multiple pieces of evidence.”","“Look at this,” he says and shows me how, before the US election, hundreds upon hundreds of websites were set up to blast out just a few links, articles that were all pro-Trump. “This is being done by people who understand information structure, who are bulk buying domain names and then using automation to blast out a certain message. To make Trump look like he’s a consensus.”","And that requires money?","“That requires organisation and money. And if you use enough of them, of bots and people, and cleverly link them together, you are what’s legitimate. You are creating truth.”","You can take an existing trending topic, such as fake news, and then weaponise it. You can turn it against the very media that uncovered it. Viewed in a certain light, fake news is a suicide bomb at the heart of our information system. Strapped to the live body of us – the mainstream media.","One of the things that concerns Howard most is the hundreds of thousands of “sleeper” bots they’ve found. Twitter accounts that have tweeted only once or twice and are now sitting quietly waiting for a trigger: some sort of crisis where they will rise up and come together to drown out all other sources of information.","Like zombies?","“Like zombies.”","Many of the techniques were refined in Russia, he says, and then exported everywhere else. “You have these incredible propaganda tools developed in an authoritarian regime moving into a free market economy with a complete regulatory vacuum. What you get is a firestorm.”","This is the world we enter every day, on our laptops and our smartphones. It has become a battleground where the ambitions of nation states and ideologues are being fought – using us. We are the bounty: our social media feeds; our conversations; our hearts and minds. Our votes. Bots influence trending topics and trending topics have a powerful effect on algorithms, Woolley, explains, on Twitter, on Google, on Facebook. Know how to manipulate information structure and you can manipulate reality.","We’re not quite in the alternative reality where the actual news has become “FAKE news!!!” But we’re almost there. Out on Twitter, the new transnational battleground for the future, someone I follow tweets a quote by Marshall McLuhan, the great information theorist of the 60s. “World War III will be a guerrilla information war,” it says. “With no divisions between military and civilian participation.”","By that definition we’re already there.","Additional reporting by Paul-Olivier Dehaye","• Carole Cadwalladr will be hosting a discussion on technology’s disruption of democracy at the bluedot festival, Jodrell Bank, Cheshire, 7-9 July"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Barricades, TV trucks and protesters frame a fortified Fifth Avenue. Armies of journalists and selfie-seeking tourists stalk Trump Tower's pink marble lobby, hoping to snap the next political power player who steps into view. Twenty-six floors up, in the same building where washed-up celebrities once battled for Trump's blessing on The Apprentice, the president-elect is choosing his Cabinet, and this contest contains all the twists and turns of his old reality show.","Winners will emerge shortly. But today's focus is on the biggest loser: New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who has just been fired from his role leading the transition, along with most of the people associated with him. The episode is being characterized as a \"knife fight\" that ends in a \"Stalinesque purge.\"","The most compelling figure in this intrigue, however, wasn't in Trump Tower. Jared Kushner was three blocks south, high up in his own skyscraper, at 666 Fifth Avenue, where he oversees his family's Kushner Companies real estate empire. Trump's son-in-law, dressed in an impeccably tailored gray suit, sitting on a brown leather couch in his impeccably neat office, displays the impeccably polite manners that won the 35-year-old a dizzying number of influential friends even before he had gained the ear, and trust, of the new leader of the free world.","\"Six months ago Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together,\" he says with a shrug. \"The media has speculated on a lot of different things, and since I don't talk to the press, they go as they go, but I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\"","The speculation was well-founded, given the story's Shakespearean twist: As a U.S. attorney in 2005, Christie jailed Kushner's father on tax evasion, election fraud and witness tampering charges. Revenge theories aside, the buzz around Kushner was directional and indicative. A year ago he had zero experience in politics and about as much interest in it. Suddenly he sits at its global center. Whether he plunged the dagger into Christie--Trump insiders insist the Bridgegate scandal did him in--is less important than the fact that he easily could have. And that power comes well-earned.","Kushner almost never speaks publicly--his chats with FORBES mark the first time he has talked about the Trump campaign or his role in it--but interviews with him and a dozen people around him and the Trump camp lead to an inescapable fact: The quiet, enigmatic young mogul delivered the presidency to the most fame-hungry, bombastic candidate in American history.","\"It's hard to overstate and hard to summarize Jared's role in the campaign,\" says billionaire Peter Thiel, the only significant Silicon Valley figure to publicly back Trump. \"If Trump was the CEO, Jared was effectively the chief operating officer.\"","\"Jared Kushner is the biggest surprise of the 2016 election,\" adds Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, who helped design the Clinton campaign's technology system. \"Best I can tell, he actually ran the campaign and did it with essentially no resources.\"","No resources at the beginning, perhaps. Underfunded throughout, for sure. But by running the Trump campaign--notably, its secret data operation--like a Silicon Valley startup, Kushner eventually tipped the states that swung the election. And he did so in manner that will change the way future elections will be won and lost. President Obama had unprecedented success in targeting, organizing and motivating voters. But a lot has changed in eight years. Specifically social media. Clinton did borrow from Obama's playbook but also leaned on traditional media. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, delved into message tailoring, sentiment manipulation and machine learning. The traditional campaign is dead, another victim of the unfiltered democracy of the Web--and Kushner, more than anyone not named Donald Trump, killed it.","That achievement, coupled with the personal trust Trump has in him, uniquely positions Kushner to be a power broker of the highest order for at least four years. \"Every president I've ever known has one or two people he intuitively and structurally trusts,\" says former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who has known Trump socially for decades and is currently advising the president-elect on foreign policy issues. \"I think Jared might be that person.\"","JARED KUSHNER'S ASCENT from Ivanka Trump's little-known husband to Donald Trump's campaign savior happened gradually. In the early days of the scrappy campaign, it was all hands on deck, with Kushner helping research policy positions on tax and trade. But as the campaign gained steam, other players began using him as a trusted conduit to an erratic candidate. \"I helped facilitate a lot of relationships that wouldn't have happened otherwise,\" Kushner says, adding that people felt safe speaking with him, without risk of leaks. \"People were being told in Washington that if they did any work for the Trump campaign, they would never be able to work in Republican politics again. I hired a great tax-policy expert who joined under two conditions: We couldn't tell anybody he worked for the campaign, and he was going to charge us double.\"","Kushner's role expanded as the Trump ticket gained traction--so did his enthusiasm. Kushner went all-in with Trump last November after seeing his father-in-law pack a raucous arena in Springfield, Illinois, on a Monday night. \"People really saw hope in his message,\" he says. \"They wanted the things that wouldn't have been obvious to a lot of people I would meet in the New York media world, the Upper East Side or at Robin Hood [Foundation] dinners.\" And so this Harvard-educated child of privilege put on a bright-red Make American Great Again hat and rolled up his sleeves.","A power vacuum awaited him at Trump Tower. When FORBES visited the Trump campaign floor in the skyscraper a few weeks before Kushner's Springfield epiphany, there was literally nothing there. No people--and no desks or chairs or computers awaiting the arrival of staffers. Just campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, spokesperson Hope Hicks and a strategy that centered on Trump making headline-grabbing statements, often by calling in to television shows, supplemented by a rally once or twice a week to provide the appearance of a traditional campaign. It was the epitome of the super-light startup: to see how little they could spend and still get the results they wanted.","Kushner stepped up to turn it into an actual campaign operation. Soon he was assembling a speech and policy team, handling Trump's schedule and managing the finances. \"Donald kept saying, 'I don't want people getting rich off the campaign, and I want to make sure we are watching every dollar just like we would do in business.'\"","That structure provided a baseline, though still a blip compared with Hillary Clinton's state-by-state machine. The decision that won Trump the presidency started on the return trip from that Springfield rally last November aboard his private 757, dubbed Trump Force One. Chatting over McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, Trump and Kushner talked about how the campaign was underutilizing social media. The candidate, in turn, asked his son-in-law to take over his Facebook initiatives.","Despite his itchy Twitter finger, Trump is a Luddite. He reportedly gets his news from print and television, and his version of e-mail is to handwrite a note that his assistant will scan and attach. Among those in his close circle, Kushner was the natural pick to create a modern campaign. Yes, like Trump he's primarily a real estate guy, but he had invested more broadly, including in media (in 2006 he bought the New York Observer) and digital commerce (he helped launch Cadre, an online marketplace for big real estate deals). More important, he knew the right crowd: co-investors in Cadre include Thiel and Alibaba's Jack Ma--and Kushner's younger brother, Josh, a formidable venture capitalist who also cofounded the $2.7 billion insurance unicorn Oscar Health.","Jared Kushner: The FORBES cover story","\"I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley, some of the best digital marketers in the world, and asked how you scale this stuff,\" Kushner says. \"They gave me their subcontractors.\"","At first Kushner dabbled, engaging in what amounted to a beta test using Trump merchandise. \"I called somebody who works for one of the technology companies that I work with, and I had them give me a tutorial on how to use Facebook micro-targeting,\" Kushner says. Synched with Trump's blunt, simple messaging, it worked. The Trump campaign went from selling $8,000 worth of hats and other items a day to $80,000, generating revenue, expanding the number of human billboards--and proving a concept. In another test, Kushner spent $160,000 to promote a series of low-tech policy videos of Trump talking straight into the camera that collectively generated more than 74 million views.","By June the GOP nomination secured, Kushner took over all data-driven efforts. Within three weeks, in a nondescript building outside San Antonio, he had built what would become a 100-person data hub designed to unify fundraising, messaging and targeting. Run by Brad Parscale, who had previously built small websites for the Trump Organization, this secret back office would drive every strategic decision during the final months of the campaign. \"Our best people were mostly the ones who volunteered for me pro bono,\" Kushner says. \"People from the business world, people from nontraditional backgrounds.\"","Kushner structured the operation with a focus on maximizing the return for every dollar spent. \"We played Moneyball, asking ourselves which states will get the best ROI for the electoral vote,\" Kushner says. \"I asked, How can we get Trump's message to that consumer for the least amount of cost?\" FEC filings through mid-October indicate the Trump campaign spent roughly half as much as the Clinton campaign did.","Just as Trump's unorthodox style allowed him to win the Republican nomination while spending far less than his more traditional opponents, Kushner's lack of political experience became an advantage. Unschooled in traditional campaigning, he was able to look at the business of politics the way so many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have sized up other bloated industries.","Television and online advertising? Small and smaller. Twitter and Facebook would fuel the campaign, as key tools for not only spreading Trump's message but also targeting potential supporters, scraping massive amounts of constituent data and sensing shifts in sentiment in real time.","\"We weren't afraid to make changes. We weren't afraid to fail. We tried to do things very cheaply, very quickly. And if it wasn't working, we would kill it quickly,\" Kushner says. \"It meant making quick decisions, fixing things that were broken and scaling things that worked.\"","This wasn't a completely raw startup. Kushner's crew was able to tap into the Republican National Committee's data machine, and it hired targeting partners like Cambridge Analytica to map voter universes and identify which parts of the Trump platform mattered most: trade, immigration or change. Tools like Deep Root drove the scaled-back TV ad spending by identifying shows popular with specific voter blocks in specific regions--say, NCIS for anti-ObamaCare voters or The Walking Dead for people worried about immigration. Kushner built a custom geo-location tool that plotted the location density of about 20 voter types over a live Google Maps interface.","Soon the data operation dictated every campaign decision: travel, fundraising, advertising, rally locations--even the topics of the speeches. \"He put all the different pieces together,\" Parscale says. \"And what's funny is the outside world was so obsessed about this little piece or that, they didn't pick up that it was all being orchestrated so well.\"","For fundraising they turned to machine learning, installing digital marketing companies on a trading floor to make them compete for business. Ineffective ads were killed in minutes, while successful ones scaled. The campaign was sending more than 100,000 uniquely tweaked ads to targeted voters each day. In the end, the richest person ever elected president, whose fundraising effort was rightly ridiculed at the beginning of the year, raised more than $250 million in four months--mostly from small donors.","As the election barreled toward its finale, Kushner's system, with its high margins and up-to-the-minute voter data, provided both ample cash and the insight on where to spend it. When the campaign registered the fact that momentum in Michigan and Pennsylvania was turning Trump's way, Kushner unleashed tailored TV ads, last-minute rallies and thousands of volunteers to knock on doors and make phone calls.","And until the final days of the campaign, he did all this without anyone on the outside knowing about it. For those who can't understand how Hillary Clinton could win the popular vote by at least 2 million yet lose handily in the electoral college, perhaps this provides some clarity. If the campaign's overarching sentiment was fear and anger, the deciding factor at the end was data and entrepreneurship.","\"Jared understood the online world in a way the traditional media folks didn't. He managed to assemble a presidential campaign on a shoestring using new technology and won. That's a big deal,\" says Schmidt, the Google billionaire. \"Remember all those articles about how they had no money, no people, organizational structure? Well, they won, and Jared ran it.\"","CONTROLLED, UNDERSTATED and calm, Jared Kushner couldn't be more different from his father-in-law in personality and style. Take Twitter. While Trump's impulsive tweeting to his 15.5 million followers reportedly forced his staff to withhold his phone during parts of the campaign, Kushner--who has had a verified account since April 2009--has never posted a single tweet.","And whereas Trump's office is wall-to-wall Donald, a memorabilia-stuffed shrine to ego, the headquarters for the Kushner Companies is sparse and sober. A leather-bound copy of Jewish teachings, the Pirkei Avot, sits on a wooden pedestal in the reception room, and identical silver mezuzahs adorn the side of each office door. The only decoration in his large, terraced boardroom is an oil painting of his grandparents, Holocaust survivors who immigrated to the U.S. after World War II. But enter Kushner's corner office and you see--under a painting with the words \"Don't Panic\" over a canvas of New York Observer pages--two critical commonalities that unite the pair: columns of real estate deal trophies and framed photos of Ivanka. If you are looking for a consistent ideology from either Kushner or Trump, it can be summarized in a word: family.","Jared and Ivanka met at a business lunch and started dating in 2007. During the courtship Kushner had met Donald only a few times in passing when, sensing the relationship was getting serious, he asked Trump for a meeting. Over lunch at the Trump Grill (which Trump briefly made a household name with his infamous taco bowl tweet), they discussed the couple's future. \"I said, 'Ivanka and I are getting serious, and we're starting to go down that path,'\" Kushner says and laughs.","\"He said, 'You'd better be serious on this.'\"","\"Jared and my father initially bonded over a combination of me and real estate,\" Ivanka Trump says in her Trump Tower offices as dark-suited Secret Service agents stand watch in the halls. \"There's a lot of parallels between Jared as a developer and my father in the early years of his development career.\"","Like Trump, Kushner grew up outside Manhattan: New Jersey in Kushner's case, versus Trump's Queens. Also like Trump, Kushner is the son of a man who created a real estate empire in his local market--Charles Kushner eventually controlled 25,000 apartments across the Northeast--and steeped his children in the family business. \"My father never really believed in summer camp, so we'd come with him to the office,\" Kushner says. \"We'd go look at jobs, work on construction sites. It taught us real work.\" Raised with three siblings in an observant Jewish home in Livingston, New Jersey, Kushner went to a private Jewish high school and then to Harvard (a 2006 book about college admissions would later single out Kushner as a prime example of how children of wealthy donors get preferential treatment; administrators quoted within that work later challenged its accuracy, calling it \"distorted\" and \"false\"). Next came New York University, for a joint J.D. and M.B.A.","His father was a huge supporter of Democrats, giving $1 million to the Democratic National Committee in 2002 and $90,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate run in 2000, and Jared largely followed suit, with more than $60,000 to Democratic committees and $11,000 to Clinton. During grad school Kushner interned for Manhattan's longtime district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, before a family scandal upended his life. In 2004 Charles Kushner pleaded guilty to tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness tampering. The latter charge brought national tabloid attention. Angry that his brother-in-law was talking to prosecutors, Charles had paid a prostitute to entrap him--a tryst that he secretly taped and then mailed to his sister.","Just 24, Jared, as the elder son, suddenly found himself charged with keeping the family together. He saw his mother most days and flew to Alabama to visit his father in prison on most weekends. He also developed a deeper bond with his brother, Josh, who had just started Harvard when the scandal broke. Says Josh, who considers Jared his best friend: \"He is the person that I turn to for guidance and support no matter the circumstance.\"","\"The whole thing taught me not to worry about the things you can't control,\" Kushner says. \"You can control how you react and can try to make things happen as you want them to. I focus on doing my best to ensure the outcomes. And when it doesn't go my way I have to work harder the next time.\"","That applied to the family business, too, which Kushner now led. To start fresh, he took aim at Manhattan, just as Trump did 40 years before, determined to play in America's most lucrative and competitive real estate market.","The timing couldn't have been worse. His first big purchase as CEO of the Kushner Companies, 666 Fifth, for a record-breaking $1.8 billion, closed in 2007--just in time for the financial crisis. Rents fell, leases broke, funding vanished. To stay solvent, Kushner sold 49% of the building's retail space to the Carlyle Group and others for $525 million and seemingly restructured every loan agreement possible, showing a willingness to pay more down the road for room to breathe in the short term. In the end he avoided the kind of bankruptcy maneuvers that Trump pulled in the 1990s and weathered the storm.","Kushner had learned a lesson. Rather than chase top-dollar, blue-chip addresses around New York, he would try to ride up with cooler, up-and-coming neighborhoods, which he has done to the tune of $14 billion worth of acquisitions and developments, in places like Manhattan's SoHo and East Village and Brooklyn's Dumbo. \"Jared brings a youthful perspective, an innovative mind-set, to a very traditional industry that's comprised of predominantly 70-year-old men,\" Ivanka Trump says. He has also pushed into resurgent areas--Astoria, Queens, and Journal Square in Jersey City--that were once the stomping grounds of Fred Trump and Charles Kushner, respectively.","PART OF THE REASON Jared Kushner has engendered such public interest, besides the power he suddenly wields and the curiosity generated by his near-invisible media presence, is the paradoxes that he represents.","He brought the Silicon Valley ethos, which values openness and inclusiveness, to a campaign that promised closed borders, trade protection and religious exclusion. He is the scion of prodigious Democratic donors yet steered a Republican presidential campaign. A grandson of Holocaust survivors who serves a man who has advocated a ban on war refugees. A fact-driven lawyer whose chosen candidate called global warming a hoax, linked vaccines to autism and challenged President Obama's citizenship. A media mogul in a campaign stoked by fake news. A devout Jew advising a president-elect embraced by the alt-right and supported by the KKK.","Kushner's answers to these conflicts come down to one core conviction--his unflagging faith in Donald Trump. A faith that, ironically, given his role in the campaign, he defends with the \"data\" he's accumulated about the man over a decade-plus relationship.","\"If I know somebody and everyone else says that this person's a terrible person,\" he says, \"I'm not going to start thinking that this person's a terrible person or disassociating myself, when my empirical data and experience is a lot more informed than many of the people casting these judgments. What would that say about me if I changed my view based on what other people think, as opposed to the facts that I actually know for myself?\"","Regarding Trump's worldview: \"I don't think it's very controversial in an election to become the president of the United States to say that your position is to put America first and to be nationalist as opposed to a globalist.\"","As for Trump's endless stream of statements that insulted and threatened Muslims, Mexicans, women, prisoners of war and U.S. generals, among others? \"I just know a lot of the things that people try to attack him with are just not true or overblown or exaggerations. I know his character. I know who he is, and I obviously would not have supported him if I thought otherwise. If the country gives him a chance, they'll find he won't tolerate hateful rhetoric or behavior.\"","On his political affiliation, he defines himself thus: \"To be determined. I haven't made a decision. Things are still evolving as they go.\" He adds: \"There's some aspects of the Democrat Party that didn't speak to me, and there are some aspects of the Republican Party that didn't speak to me. People in the political world try to put you into different buckets based on what exists. I think Trump's creating his own bucket--a blend of what works and eliminating what doesn't work.\" (Though in using the GOP-favored pejorative \"Democrat Party\" over the traditional \"Democratic Party,\" Kushner gives a hint about the contents of his bucket.)","The allegations of anti-Semitism hit closer to home. In July, Trump tweeted a graphic of Hillary Clinton against a background of dollar bills and a six-pointed star that contained the words \"most corrupt candidate ever,\" an image that had allegedly originated on a white supremacist message board. Dana Schwartz, a reporter for Kushner's Observer, wrote a widely read piece for the paper's site urging her boss, given the prominence he places on his faith and family, to denounce the tweet. Kushner responded with an opinion piece that defended Trump using the same old line: that he knows Trump. \"If even the slightest infraction against what the speech police have deemed correct speech is instantly shouted down with taunts of 'racist,' then what is left to condemn the actual racists?\"","Kushner insists today that there will be no hate element in the Trump Administration, starting at the top. \"You can't not be a racist for 69 years, then all of a sudden become a racist, right?\" he says. \"You can't not be an anti-Semite for 69 years and all of a sudden become an anti-Semite because you're running.\"","His reaction to fringe elements, like the KKK and the white nationalist alt-right, who have embraced Trump? \"Trump has disavowed their support 25 times. He's renounced hatred, he's renounced bigotry, and he's renounced racism. I don't know if he could ever denounce them enough for some people.\" He then paraphrases a quote he attributes to Ronald Reagan: \"Just because they support me doesn't mean that I support them.\"","Kushner's support extends to Steve Bannon, Trump's strategic advisor, who had been accused by his ex-wife of making anti-Semitic comments (he denies it) and whose website, Breitbart, has often published articles that dog-whistle racist, anti-Semitic sentiments. \"Do you hold me accountable for every single thing that the Observer' s ever written, like they came from me?\" Kushner says. \"All I know about Steve is my experience working with him. He's an incredible Zionist and loves Israel. He was one of the leaders in the anti-divestiture campaign. And what I've seen from working together with him was somebody who did not fit the description that people are pushing on him. I choose to judge him based on my experience and seeing the job he's done, as opposed to what other people are saying about him.\"","And that seems to reflect how Kushner feels about friends upset by his role in electing someone who offends their values, to the point where, before the election, several wrote to him in fits of pique. \"I call it an exfoliation. Anyone who was willing to change a friendship or not do business because of who somebody supports in politics is not somebody who has a lot of character.","\"People are very fickle,\" he adds. \"You have to find what you believe in, challenge your truths. And if you believe in something, even if it's unpopular, you have to push with it.\"","MANY OF THOSE fickle friends are likely to return now that Kushner, after masterminding Trump's stunning victory, has the ear of the future president. What he will do with that power is anyone's guess.","For now, Kushner plays coy: \"There's a lot of people who have been asking me to get involved in a more official capacity. I just have to think about what that means for my family, for my business and make sure it'd be the right thing for a multitude of reasons.\"","It's unlikely that he can hold a formal position in the Trump White House. Nepotism laws established after President Kennedy made brother Bobby attorney general bar the president from giving government roles to relatives--including in-laws. Reports have stated that the administration is exploring every legal angle to get Kushner into the West Wing--including adding him as an unpaid advisor, though even that may be covered by the law, which was written to ensure fealty to the Constitution rather than the individual.","But it may be a moot point. With or without a government title or a $170,000 federal salary, there's no law that bans a president from seeking counsel from whomever he wants. It's clear America's tech and entrepreneurial leaders, who heavily backed Clinton and collectively denounced Trump, will use Kushner as a go-between and that Trump will lean on him just as heavily.","\"I assume he'll be in the White House throughout the entire presidency,\" says News Corp. billionaire Rupert Murdoch. \"For the next four or eight years he'll be a strong voice, maybe even the strongest after the vice president.\"","I cover the Forbes Under 30 franchise, technology, entrepreneurs, billionaires and VC's. When I get the chance I write about food and booze too. Previously I edited Forbes's front-of-the-book section \"Leaderboard,\" and was a proud member of the Forbes 400 Wealth Team.

The share plunge erased $5billion from the net worth of Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg as calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British firm hired by Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy called for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter. The two lawmakers said the companies “have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data” and that the lack of oversight “raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.”","Senator Ron Wyden asked Facebook to provide more information on what he called a “troubling” misuse of private data that could have been used to sway voters. Wyden said he wants to know how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook tools “to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.”","In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage. Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations “horrifying, if confirmed,” and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week. In Britain, parliamentary committee chair Damian Collins said both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had questions to answer.","“We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Collins said in a statement. Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee.” Alexander Nix is chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, which has denied misusing Facebook data for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research said the revelations highlight “systemic problems at Facebook,” but that they won’t immediately impact the social network’s revenues."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn't authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook's unusual public explanation of the move wasn't clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company. For the \"avoidance of doubt,\" the spokesman said, none of Kogan's data was used in Cambridge Analytica's 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign .","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Nix said Assange said no. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","News reports now suggest that contrary to prior representations, Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Jared Kushner to run Trump’s data operation, had contacts with Russians, specifically a Russian energy firm. (“Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed ‘micro-targeting’ individuals on social media during elections.”)","Cambridge Analytica was also the subject of a Wall Street Journal report, which found that “the chief executive of a data-analytics firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing, according to a person familiar with the effort. The outreach by the CEO of the firm, which is partly owned by a major Trump donor and has close ties to a Trump adviser, came as Mr. Trump was publicly cheering the leaks of his Democratic rival’s emails and some supporters were seeking to unearth further messages.” And one more nugget: None other than Michael Flynn had an “advisory role” with a firm linked to Cambridge Analytica.","Maybe this is all coincidence. Perhaps Cambridge Analytica has no role whatsoever in providing guidance or data to Russians seeking to manipulate the U.S. election. Perhaps Facebook was an entirely innocent player, hoodwinked by Cambridge Analytica (which was recently suspended from the platform), and had no idea that all this data was being sourced to aid in foreign manipulation of our election. However, at this point, Congress and the American people have considerable reason to doubt those conclusions.","Congress needs to get executives from Facebook (Zuckerberg himself) and Cambridge Analytica up to the Hill promptly to get answers from both firms. The public needs to know:","What was the extent of contacts between Cambridge Analytica and Russian officials?","Did Cambridge Analytica help guide the Russian social media operation by, for example, targeting specific users?","What information did Kushner have, if any, about Cambridge Analytica’s operation and its use of Facebook data?","What did Facebook know about Cambridge Analytica’s operation, when did it know it, and has it been candid and forthcoming in its disclosures?","Answers to these questions are critical not only to the Russia investigation but also to the future of social media platforms. The stakes are obviously high for Facebook, especially if it (intentionally or not) provided more of a boost to Trump’s victory than previously acknowledged. As intelligence analyst Malcolm Nance put it, “What happens if 100s of millions of progressives worldwide abandon Facebook because they think it’s a tool of Trump, Russia authoritarians and neo-Nazis? Facebook needs to own up and do damage control to ensure they are not 2018’s information cruise missile of choice.” Even if it never intended to bolster Trump, it’s hard to disagree that it was lax in recognizing manipulation of its platform and in disclosing the extent of the misuse of users’ data. “What’s clear is that Facebook has built up a massive intelligence tool that can be exploited by foreign actors who don’t care at all if they are violating Facebook’s user agreements,” remarks Max Bergmann, who heads the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress. “This incident demonstrates that it is time for Washington to get serious about regulating the tech companies. They’ve been living in a libertarian fantasy world of ‘don’t be evil’ but that doesn’t work when you have a fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders to prioritize profits.”","Facebook’s conduct during and after the 2016 election may well lead to federal regulation of social media of the type Klobuchar, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) are sponsoring, which would require archiving of political ads with detailed information regarding “a description of the audience the advertisement targets, the number of views generated, the dates and times of publication, the rates charged, and the contact information of the purchaser” and also subject online ads to the same campaign regulations that govern TV and radio ads.","At this point, it is increasingly hard to argue against such regulation, given the cavalier conduct of Facebook and the obvious opportunities for abuse by malicious foreign governments.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

{"originalurl":"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html","title":"Facebook Exit Hints at Dissent on Handling of Russian Trolls - The New York Times","text":["As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation, an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive.","The impending exit of that executive — Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer — reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

That position put Stamos at odds with Sheryl Sandberg and other executives inside the company.","A well-known figure in the world of cybersecurity, Stamos’ day-to-day responsibilities were assigned to others in December – prompting him to make plans to leave, the Times said. Stamos was convinced to stay on until August to avoid causing concern among employees, the report said. Reuters also reported that Stamos planned to leave in August.","In a tweet following the report, Stamos said he was “still fully engaged” at Facebook, despite the “rumours.” He acknowledged that his role had changed and that he was currently focused on “emerging security risks and election security,” but he did not say anything about whether he planned to remain at the company past August.","Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","In an emailed statement to Business Insider, Facebook said that Stamos “continues to be the Chief Security Officer (CSO) at Facebook,” but did not address whether he planned to leave in August.","“He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day,” Facebook’s statement said.","The news of Stamos’ departure comes amid revelations that the personal information of 50 million Facebook users was stolen and exploited during America’s 2016 presidential election.

He quit after then-CEO Marissa Mayer agreed to scan customer emails for US intelligence officials, Reuters reported in 2016.","I don't know a more universally respected leader in information security. @alexstamos has held several of the biggest CSO jobs on the planet, and he has resigned on ethical grounds before.

We haven't met, though you seem to know quite a bit about me. When I log onto Facebook, I see you know that I shop at Bloomingdales, practice Judaism and buy a spray to make feet smell better (for my son — I swear!). I sort of missed the warning, though, that anything I did on Facebook could be obtained by a Steve Bannon-led, Robert Mercer-funded, Russian-related sleaze machine that could bombard impressionable voters with propaganda.","In her 2013 book \"Lean In,\" Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg informed us that only 22 out of 197 heads of state and only 18% members of Congress were then women, inspiring women to lean in all over the place.","Advertisement","So a woman finally gets the major-party nomination — and Facebook helps divide and manipulate voters through fake ads to sink her, leaving a Putin-happy reality TV star who routinely degrades women in charge? Maybe I leaned in a little too far — because this felt like a swift kick in my . . . assumptions.","But here's an idea for you guys. Apparently, it's your access and analytics that helped get people to the polls. Just suppose you used that in a nonpartisan way, to get all people voting in the next election. Voting rates in the U.S. are abysmally low — cited by Pew Research Center as hovering at around 55% as opposed to the upwards of 80% in many other developed countries.","What if Facebook (and Twitter and other big tech companies) could be instrumental in increasing voter participation in the U.S. going forward? Right now, people are deleting Facebook accounts in fear and protest. Your stock price is falling. Attorney generals are investigating. The FTC and Congress have come a-calling, and let's face it — this is not your first scandal rodeo.","So nobody thought to check whether an unverified St. Petersburg University-affiliated professor who scraped the private data of more than 50 million users without consent might be affiliated with… the Russians? Dude! Got to get up pretty early in the morning to get one by Zuckerberg!","Nothing? Facebook took $100,000 from Russians for 3,000 ads? Dislike! Sad! Angry face! Now Cambridge Analytica - or the new Emerdata — publicly crows they threw the election to Trump, and Russia allegedly hacks everything U.S. from voting rolls to energy grids and water processing plants, so who needs Facebook anymore? So 2016.","I checked to see if maybe I missed the \"Dear Putin, Judi likes liberal causes and buys clothing that is really too young for her: part of the user agreement. I read \"Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers\" about \"Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services.\" I found nothing that indicated \"we are giving Russian professors free reign to your 411 for their 'research' without checking out who they might be working for or insuring that they haven't gone beyond the scope of their access\" or even \"we *might* let Steve Bannon take out fake ads and start a disinformation campaign so don't believe everything you read.\"","Use your power for non-partisan good now: Work for America this time. Your civic engagement team is at work, providing a new voting planner with information on candidates, and putting voting information on newsfeeds. You provide town hall information already. Facebook, along with other big tech companies, could now push to forge the kind of voter engagement that transforms US political participation - using the kind of personalized, in-your-face targeted advertising that you have fine tuned to an art form.","Instead of \"click on a tab somewhere to the left to access information if you want it\", or something that passes by on my newsfeed, maybe you could step it up and use your the \"Ping: look at this, Judi!\" techniques. The 2016 election is over and the scraped information out there. If you can use your unique social network access and analytics to get people to vote, not to incite them to vote for a particular candidate, Facebook can help voting reflect the face of an America we will all be proud of."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

This past weekend, Facebook took out full-page ads in major newspapers apologizing for a, quote, \"breach of trust.\" The company placed the ads after news broke that a political data mining firm, Cambridge Analytica, reportedly used the data of 50 million Facebook users. One person who does not buy the apology is Tim Wu. He's a former senior adviser at the Federal Trade Commission. And he was there in 2011, the last time that Facebook got in trouble for failing to keep its promises about privacy. Tim Wu is skeptical that the company will change its ways anytime soon.","TIM WU: The problem the FTC was confronting was the problem, similar to now, that there were a number of abusive apps that you installed, and then they did a lot more with your data than you thought they were. And one of the big problems is that Facebook gave you the impression that you could control your own privacy by, you know, setting the settings in certain ways, but those settings didn't do anything. They were, like, fake buttons.","KING: Why even put them up if they were fake, just to give people a sense of security?","WU: Yes, or - you know, they prevented some things, but the apps were very easily capable of getting around the settings. So they promised to fix it all up. They entered in a big consent decree. They agreed to audits every two years for the next 20 years and a massive privacy probe. It was all going to be different. But the problem didn't go away. In fact, those little settings remained fake. The survey app that we - really, created by Cambridge Analytica - was able to take the data of people's friends and family and take it all for itself even though Facebook was supposedly not allowing that. So that is the problem. They've basically broken the promise they made to the country in 2011 and the promises they kept making to everybody through these privacy settings. And I think that's the core of the problem.","KING: Why does Facebook continue breaking its promises? Aren't they afraid that they'll get hammered by the FTC if they don't shape up?","WU: I think they clearly did not make it a priority. Let's put it that way. And I think that period, 2012 to 2015, was one where they were obsessed with revenue generation. And the fact is that privacy - it's like kryptonite to their business model. You know, they have to be able to promise their advertisers that they have the goods on everyone and they have the power to manipulate people. And so if they are also extremely tight on privacy, that tends to throw a wrench into the machine.","KING: Many of us use Facebook, and we want to keep using Facebook. And Facebook is a business. So what exactly is the fix here?","WU: I think the problem lies here. It's actually a very fundamental one, which is Facebook is always in the position of serving two masters. If its actual purpose was just trying to connect friends and family, and it didn't have a secondary motive of trying to also prove to another set of people that it could gather as much data as possible and make it possible to manipulate or influence or persuade people, then it wouldn't be a problem. For example, if they were a nonprofit, it wouldn't be a problem. But they...","KING: But they're not, right? (Laughter).","WU: They're not. But, well, that's the problem. I think there's a sort of intrinsic problem with having for-profit entities with this business model in this position of so much public trust because they're always at the edge because their profitability depends on it.","KING: Let me ask you - Facebook runs afoul of the FTC. Can the FTC seek damages for that violation? Can they fine Facebook?","WU: Yes, they can. Every single violation is punishable by a $40,000 fine. So it could be billions of dollars in damages if the FTC decides to police this very aggressively.","KING: Do you think Mark Zuckerberg is sincere in his apologies? He appeared on television. He seemed really concerned by what had happened. Are you buying it?","WU: He's the kind of guy who tends to decide how he should feel and then feel that way. I think at the heart of this company is something rotten, is some overwhelming ambition to be the biggest, most powerful company out there. And it's because they're running fast and hard, trying to break things and handling stuff that's almost like radioactive material - people's data - I think more mistakes are going to happen. I don't think we're at the end of it unless they fundamentally change their business model.","KING: And fundamentally, that would make them a less successful business. So they are not likely to, are they?","WU: Well, if Mark Zuckerberg is telling the truth when he says, what I care about is connecting people to their families and friends, that's a very lofty ambition. If that's what he really wants to do, he can do it. But it doesn't mean he'll be the most profitable company in the world. You know, utilities - which is what Facebook is, a social utility - have never been understood as profit centers before.","KING: Right.","WU: And there's a reason. The social sphere is a little bit different. And maybe we need to accept that it's not a source of major profit to be in people's personal lives.","KING: We've talked a lot about what you think Facebook's responsibilities are and some moves that they could make. What about just straight-up government regulation? What would regulating Facebook look like even if Facebook didn't 100 percent like it or want it?","WU: So there's two major ways this could happen, and they all revolve around the idea that personal data is very sensitive. You know, it's almost like radioactive waste or something. You can't just dump it all over the place, right? And that's basically what Facebook has been doing. And now we're finding out, hey, it's kind of dangerous when we let people, completely unregulated, handle this stuff. So they need to be a fiduciary, be a trustee when it comes to the personal data of their customers. They need to be under very strong legal duties to handle that stuff carefully and properly and not, for example, allow it to be given out to random researchers without even anonymizing it or really making sure it doesn't get stolen. You know, they didn't take any serious measures to prevent it from being stolen. And that's where regulation would go.","KING: What do you think a realistic future looks like for Facebook?","WU: I think a time of reckoning is coming. I think they need new management, frankly. Yes, I do. I don't think this management is doing what they say that they're promising, which is putting people's privacy first. They've been saying that for years. They're not actually doing it. Either that - they can stay the same, then they need to be under a lot more government supervision if we're going to trust them.","KING: Tim Wu is a professor at Columbia Law School. He was a senior adviser at the Federal Trade Commission.

The data breach has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation.","House Energy and Commerce Committee spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify”.","On the same day, Zuckerberg turned down British lawmakers’ invitations to explain to a British parliamentary committee what went wrong.","The company said it would instead send one of his deputies, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.","The head of the committee called Zuckerberg’s decision “astonishing” and urged him to think again.","Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.","AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie’s remarks.

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and former Trump senior adviser Stephen Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called “psychographic” profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of the investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said that Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked, as well as some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook’s policies and passed the information to Cambridge and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan’s activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan’s app at the time and demanded certifications from Kogan and Cambridge, and Wylie, that the information he had shared had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to Facebook that they had done so. But Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company’s methods of data collections have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

{"originalurl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/28/facebook-voters-us-election-ted-cruz-targeted-ads-trump?CMP=share_btn_tw","title":"How Facebook tracks and profits from voters in a $10bn US election | US news | The Guardian","text":["The Keep the Promise group of Super Pacs, which support Ted Cruz, have poured almost $100,000 into Facebook ads this month.\nPhotograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images","If you lived in north-east Iowa, the evangelical stronghold where the battle for the soul of conservative American politics will play out in person on Monday, and happened to have given Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign your email address sometime in the last few months, you might find something especially appealing this weekend in your Facebook feed.","You might see, amid the family photos, a menacing video of Donald Trump talking about how “my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa”. LIKE ON ABORTION, blares the sponsored ad from Cruz’s deep-pocketed, social media-savvy digital team. And you might wonder how this campaign managed, by paying Facebook, to differentiate between Trump’s “New York values” and “OURS”.","Facebook, which told investors on Wednesday it was “excited about the targeting”, does not let candidates track individual users. But it does now allow presidential campaigns to upload their massive email lists and voter files – which contain political habits, real names, home addresses and phone numbers – to the company’s advertising network. The company will then match real-life voters with their Facebook accounts, which follow individuals as they move across congressional districts and are filled with insightful data.","The data is encrypted and not maintained by Facebook after ads run, the company said. Acxiom, a massive data broker based in Little Rock, Arkansas, helps campaigns upload the voter info. But a campaign operative said the Texas senator has been using Facebook ads to raise money, among other things, and a Guardian analysis shows Cruz-affiliated donors are spending $10,000 per day on Facebook “placement” as the first vote nears.","In Iowa, the Cruz campaign is using Facebook to target voters on a range of broad issues like immigration controls to niche specific causes such as abolishing state laws against the sale of fireworks. The Guardian understands the campaign has built a specific model for this relatively small group of voters, who may be responsive to Cruz ads against big government, and in some cases is going out to find them individually.","Political scientists, current campaign advisors and former digital gurus to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agree: a Facebook ad is perhaps the best money to spend inwhat could be a nearly $10bn election, and 2016 is fast becoming the year Facebook learned to profit from how you vote.","The acceleration of real-time voter targeting reflects a growing consensus that, in addition to knocking down Trump this weekend, campaigns of the future will depend as much on being able to track people across screens and apps as knocking on doors or sending out flyers.","Facebook profiles turned into campaign currency also offer another sign of Silicon Valley’s growing influence in America’s political system. The company in recent years has increased its lobbying efforts in Washington to press immigration, surveillance and patent policy, while doubling its political staff and adding other features to make it easier for campaigns to reach specific voting groups in what Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg this week dubbed “the new town hall”.","“Facebook is the easiest and most effective platform,” said Zac Moffatt, the top digital strategist for Romney’s 2012 campaign whose firm, Targeted Victory, has worked with most of the Republican presidential candidates and the Republican National Committee during this election cycle. “They are so much more valuable than they were eight years ago.”","Shaping perceptions, making millions","Campaigns have been using Facebook to talk to voters since 2008, when Obama’s first bid for president famously used the platform to get supporters to push their digital friends to support the upstart senator. In 2012, Facebook began co-sponsoring presidential debates in the Republican primaries.","This time around, as Republicans spend big to catch up on Democrats’ advantage on tech-driven campaigns, Facebook has launched another new feature to help campaigns target politically active users, who might post constantly about Trump’s latest insult or share the increasing poll leads of Bernie Sanders.","Facebook will find users who like lots of political content and share it with their friends, mark them as “political influencers” and allow campaigns to target them specifically. As one of Facebook’s monetization executives explained to Wired after the quiet launch of influencer tracking in November: “People are more likely to trust information that their friends share.”","Cruz’s campaign began using this product immediately after launch. Chris Wilson, the Texas senator’s director of research and analytics, said the campaign had found success in targeting voters in this way. “It can help the message to spread far more quickly than other types of advertising,” he told the Guardian.","We’re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.","Sheryl Sandberg","Facebook is “playing a key role in shaping the public perception of a candidate definitely more so than in the past”, said Marie Danzig, former deputy digital director for the 2012 Obama campaign and now head of creative and delivery at Blue State Digital, a Democratic campaign group that also works with nonprofits and companies.","Part of the shift, Danzig said, comes from Facebook – long the place where cranky relatives debate politics and politicians ask for “likes” – growing older as “more and more of our grandparents popped up on there”. The presidential race was the most discussed topic on the site in 2015 – the year before voting starts, with the Iowa caucuses on Monday and a slew of primary states thereafter.","In the meantime, Americans in general are spending more time on smartphones and since the last election Facebook has begun serving mobile video ads. In an earnings call last year, Facebook executives said that one of every five minutes Americans spend on smartphones is spent on Facebook.","It remains unclear how much Facebook stands to profit from its role in the election, but political spending on digital ads is expected to exceed $1bn in 2016, up from $159m in 2012, according to research by media analysts at Borrell Associates. Half of online political ad spending in 2016 is expected to go toward social media.","Analysts at Citigroup this fall estimated campaigns will spend about $607m on digital ads during the 2016 cycle, an increase from $145m in the 2012 election. The analysts expect Facebook to edge out Alphabet’s YouTube as the leading recipient of that spending.","Facebook's quarterly earnings surpass $5bn for first time thanks to ad sales","Read more","Those campaign spending estimates represent a sliver of the $5.6bn in ad sales Facebook reported on Wednesday that it had earned during the last three months of 2015. (The company said 80% – about $4.6bn – came from mobile advertising alone). Facebook does not break out ad spending on politics, and the price per ad is based on a constant auction.","Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer, told investors during a call on Wednesday that “the 2016 election is a big deal in terms of ad spend”, comparing direct political advertising from campaigns and outside groups to the World Cup, the Super Bowl and the Olympics. That ability to target, Sandberg said, was key: “Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those”, she told analysts. “And we’re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.”","Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, said the company was trying to “introduce organic ways the people can interact with businesses” as well as “the politicians – not necessarily ads but organic interactions”.","Sandberg was more specific in connecting organic sharing with targeted advertising: “We think that kind of direct engagement, where people can hold their elected officials accountable and elected officials can speak directly to constituents, is a really important part of our mission.”","‘A tool that travels with you’","Volunteers and operatives from more than a dozen campaigns are busy knocking on doors and blitzing old-fashioned mailboxes this weekend. But perhaps the more effective direct marketing is being done far away from backyards in Iowa.","When Trump dropped out of Thursday’s Republican debate in a boycott of Fox News, Cruz’s digital team turned around an instant meme – Ducking Donald – that went viral, but more importantly provided them with fresh email addresses, which in turn could become more donations and targeted Facebook ads.","The Texas senator told the Guardian in an interview last year that his digital funding and outreach apparatus “is very much the Obama model”, but many Republican campaigns have accepted so-called micro-targeting as the new norm in spending unregulated donations effectively.","“Facebook has been a game-changer for our campaign and for the entire electoral process,” she said. “We now have the ability to go live directly to the voters and reach thousands of people instantly.”","Features that target political “influencers” across social media are especially helpful as voters move from one address to another. “Facebook is a tool that travels with you,” said Eitan Hersh, assistant professor in political science at Yale University.","There’s an important difference between what people share voluntarily ... and what they have no desire to share.","Chris Wilson, Ted Cruz's director of research and analytics","Cruz’s campaign has paid at least $750,000 to a consulting firm with expertise in harvesting psychological data from tens of thousands of Facebook profiles, as the Guardian revealed in December.","Wilson, from the Cruz campaign, said: “[Facebook] is effective because it allows us to reach voters and it’s useful because it allows us to take our message directly to them.” He suggested Facebook ads are less intrusive because, unlike traditional TV ads, people can scroll past them.","He dismissed any suggestion of a discrepancy between Cruz’s past opposition to government bulk surveillance and his use of targeted techniques online. In a telephone interview, Wilson said: “There’s an important difference between what people share voluntarily on social media and what they have no desire to share, like their cellphone metadata.”","On its campaign website, Facebook cites a 2013 study that found $1 can buy 200 ads on its newsfeed compared to two direct mail pieces.","Analysis of federal campaign disclosures shows the Keep the Promise group of Super Pacs, which support Cruz, have poured almost $100,000 into Facebook ads this month. In recent days, its spending with Facebook has intensified to around $10,000 per day for “digital media production/placement”.","Overall, this kind of spending would allow the donor coalition to place an estimated 20m ads across the social network.","The next round of mandatory disclosures is expected to reveal a windfall of digital consulting fees on Sunday, allowing a fuller transparency of how Super Pac funding powers social media targeting to arrive just one day before the Iowa caucuses.","For all the talk of technical wizardry, it remains risky for campaigns to become overly reliant on digital acumen, said Harper Reed, the chief technology officer of Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. “It’s just more complicated,” Reed said in a recent interview. “It’s so much more about technology than people. Politics are weird-ass nuanced things.”","Additional reporting by Ben Jacobs in Des Moines, Iowa, and Sam Thielman in New York"],"isopubdate":"2016-01-28"}

Roosevelt wanted to file an antitrust suit to stop the deal. The financiers threatened that the lawsuit would cause a panic on Wall Street, to which TR's attorney general, Philander G. Knox, memorably replied: \"There is no stock ticker at the Department of Justice.\"","When Roosevelt ignored the threats and moved to file the trustbusting suit, he received a hasty visit from J. Pierpont Morgan, the reigning financial titan. \"If we have done anything wrong, send your man to my man and they can fix it up,\" offered Morgan. TR responded unflinchingly, \"That can't be done.\"","I wish more people would just recognize that it is meant to be PUBLIC SERVICE. We push the wrong people into the political sausage machine, the handle turns, and we wonder why shit comes out the other end.","Here. Supposedly this is when Roosevelt \"realized\" that big business had too much power and decided on the Square Deal. He'd likely had this notion before then, coming up as he did through NYC politics where the ultra-wealthy were very influential, but it might have galvanized him in some way. The quote is real enough, but the notation that it alone sparked Roosevelt to seek legislation is probably not.","I mean, its the smart thing to do. Zuck has improved a ton, but he is not naturally a great speaker. Especially under pressure. They're going to send some really skilled PR shills who can spin better under pressure. Zuck is libel to tell the truth or something dangerous like that.","Can you imagine? Creating an empire when you’re in your early 20’s, and doing the rest of your job with minimal human contact (and with a team of people to get you through it), is the perfect way to make sure you never outgrow the hang ups from your early 20’s.","He doesn't as much Evade, in my opinion as he seems Eluded by most of the criticism levied against him and his company.","Most of the criticism that makes seemingly reasonable people go \"What the flipping fuck?\" bounces off him as if it were a rubber pellet and he seems completely unfazed by any and all of it.","I understand that if I was in his position I would probably be immensely overwhelmed by the constant barrage of criticism and fixing of different issues within the company but the fact that he shows so little empathy despite holding the world's largest database of empathic information should be concerning to most people.","Not defending FB at all; accountability goes all the way to the top - that's not lost on me.","In general, though, this seems like a reasonable move for any CEO to take when being asked for details about a complex concern in his/her very large organization. Good CEOs surround themselves with people that make them the dumbest in the room. By this point in FB's growth, I would expect that Mark is not the best-qualified to speak to this audience and field these questions.","Should he be there, from a PR perspective? Absolutely. But I don't expect that would actually facilitate the conversation one iota.","Between Donald as POTUS and Mark as CEO of the world's largest and most dangerous social media platform, we're in an age of, \"The buck stops anywhere but here.\"","More than a lesson in how not to do PR, I think this is a lesson on what bad leadership looks like. Civil leadership, military leadership, business leadership, and project management courses of the future should use Donald and Mark as examples of shit leaders in their case studies.","In pr you only wheel out the CEO when you have to. Send in 2 people who won't say anything and your safe. Zuck may say something that could get him in trouble or be led in questioning somewhere he doesnt want to be. He says something wrong and could do more damage or actually have real consequences and it's a terrible look to be asking your lawyer or advisor mid question for an answer.","Right now harm minimisation is the aim, they can't spin this to a positive but if he showed up the world's cameras will definitely be there and it will be a top story everywhere.","I'd argue he has enough money to hire and get advice from the most talented and expensive PR people. His whole company is founded on the manipulation of the attention of the masses. Right now laying low is probably the best strategy. It'll only blow up more if there's video (the only media people seem to care about) of him getting dressed down in a public hearing.","Not turning up himself is going to be very problematic for him. The Brits might well look like they will accept this, but in reality it gives them free range to turn round and say at a later date 'We tried to involve Facebook, but they wouldn't fully engage. Therefore we have no choice but to do X.'","They just don't get how this stuff looks and I don't think you can attribute it to anything other than corporate arrogance - things have been so easy for them for so long that they believe their own hype - this almost always ends badly.","To get an idea of the culture in Facebook around their current situation, one could do worse than look at this video of their VP of Public Policy speaking to the Singaporean Government last week.","I know this is only one section of this hearing and one person - but the tone and way he speaks is indicative of a wider corporate arrogance - especially as he's been at the company a while and is one of their spokespeople...","You're there to answer their questions you arrogant bearded egg, not the ones you want to answer","But that's exactly what the committee member and the chair man both said: \"if you don't want to answer a question because you feel like you're unable to properly comment on something your colleague said, state so\" They don't force him to answer something he doesn't want to address, they just say \"don't bullshit us\".","He was trying to weasel his way out by saying the question is irrelevant to the matter at hand, that's why they snapped at him","They did, extremely courteously at that. As soon as the guy opened his mouth and came out with the line about ''a good use of our time'' he needed dropping. I can't see a typical UK politician having that shit for longer than the sentence ending, and i'm hardly an endorser of our politicians. It is bizarrely brash.","This. A lot of people forego that Singapore is a dictatorship. it's a well functioning one economically, but it's still a dictatorship, which can be seen in, for example, the freedom of press ranking you're referring to.","That'll be K. Shanmugan, our Minister for Law and Home Affairs. Don't let his forked tongue charm you, he typically does this same condescending dressing down (i.e. bullying) to opposition Members of Parliament.","I thought he was moving the mic away from him to show that he refused to answer/acknowledge the reprimand, presumably because he thought of himself as above that. Hence the response by the singaporean rep which meant \"Are you done acting out already?\".","We do. There are plenty of examples of reps and senators grandstanding during hearings like this. But it is just fluff....nothing ever happens, no justice is ever served. Just strong words were had, and the corporations just keep doing what they were doing (maybe with a small fine).","Our minister of law and home affairs laying the smackdown on the FB exec. Very satisfying to watch. In fact Singapore is having a series of consultation on deliberate online falsehoods. FB and google straight up said they won't take action unless directed by legislation to address fake news.","I'm not disagreeing that those two points might be part of a deliberate strategy on the part of FB. But responses like \"if you've got a point then get to it\", \"these questions aren't relevant\", \"maybe ask someone else a question\" are not a clever or effective way to implement that strategy here.","But seriously see the arrogance by the Facebook rep? This is face of a well paid, young corporate soldier who respects nothing but their own cv and salary. The world is being eroded by these types who have no moral compass.","The main reason why Zuckerberg refused is probably because he is not experienced in dealing with negative PR. If you looked at his former interviews, he can be charismatic if the audience is welcoming and believes that Zuckerberg can do no wrong, at those moments, he is pretty enthusiastic, there are only some rare instances where Zuckerberg was confronted.","One of them I remembered was when the interviewer asked about the hoodie he was wearing, and he was exceedingly nervous, it was a fairly awkward ordeal for him for sure, I could see it from his expressions.","The board probably knew about this and recommended Zuckerberg to not speak. Because if Zuckerberg slips at any moment speaking with the UK Parliament, it would probably be a huge disaster for Facebook.","Though, I do believe that Facebook will only get a slap on the wrist, and everything will go back to normal again.","I think if your audience doubts you at all and aren’t going to believe every word you say, then yeah it’s a normal human reaction. If you’re well liked then you probably will be more comfortable in front of then. While I can understand why their lawyers dont want him speaking for the company’s sake, it looks bad to both the public and parliament. I mean seriously what kind of CEO can’t speak on his company’s behalf. Let me say that again: a CEO can’t talk about his own company.","For sure it looks bad on Zuckerberg/Facebook's part, but it's better to lose a little rather than to lose spectacularly. If Zuckerberg goes and completely bombs in front of the parliament, can you imagine the headline? The entire media would go apeshit, and stakeholder confidence would plummet way more than a potentially bad testimony with a representative in front of the parliament. That is exactly what the Facebook board would want to avoid, especially with the drop in shareholder confidence, right now it is the time for Facebook to stabilize from the media blowback.","Personally I would be to guess that Facebook got too big for Zuckerberg to handle that he probably doesn't know too much of the details of the internal operation, and most of the operations goes to his chief of staff, and if that is the case, even more case for him to not go.","Sorry but everyone here is just tripping. UK gov and May especslly don't have the publics interest at heart, they would use this FB drama as an excuse to crack down on the Internet in general like always. Then the shitty \"newspapers\" will release a bunch of stories about Muslims and peadophiles plotting evil things through Facebook and all the pensioners and dumbass baby boomers will cheer and ask for more","Amusing. Parliament can compel UK citizens to attend if they chose, edit it's not optional it technically is optional. New laws never materialised, however no one seems to have ever refused repeat requests.","While fuckerberg isn't a UK citizen MPs don't exactly like the answer \"No\".","with the new EU GDPR we might be able to completely drive facebook out of europe for good. penalties of up to 4% worldwide turnover is alot, even facebook won't be able to handle this for long. i'm just waiting until some facebook whistleblower publishes evidence that they keep deleted account data past 25th may and see the EU/the countries start court cases for every single account that's been affected..","Rough guess is the keeping of any information on anyone not signed up will be identified as criminal, and all permissions will have to be explicitly opted into, not just assumed as true. No passing of info to 3rd parties will be legal.","Upshot is Facebook is forced to close down until it is massively reworked, at least in europe. The stock will tank.","Alternatively, whilst it's possible (and likely) that EU countries will appoint one regulator amongst them to deal with Facebook (one fine to cover them all), there is no obligation to do so. Potentially they could be facing 30 different regulators all investigating Facebook for all the particular offences within their own countries. Nothing short of a logistical nightmare for Facebook.","i wouldn't be surprised if facebook would go down before the first big fines have even been paid. any investor will jump ship when multi billion dollar fines of that magnitude start appearing on the horizon. in the end facebook might not even have the money to pay the fines, when their inflated stock value starts dwindling.","Zuck is a figurehead at FB but he is out of his league for years. He built a little product in college but he's surrounded by real business people like Sandberg who are really the brains at the top. Zuckerberg looks like a deer in the headlights these days","I honestly wouldn't blame him. I think you're absolutely right in that he's unable to handle the sheer size of modern facebook.","Mark, take a look at Tom from Myspace, write yourself a nice fat check while you're still supreme leader, and go do whatever the fuck you want for the rest of your life. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. That's okay.","I really don't understand what people like Zuckerberg are doing with their lives. If I had 0.01% of his wealth, I would be eternally grateful and live off the interest for life. He isn't Musk; aiming for some humanitarian necessity that no government is working towards; attempting to alter the course of global energy consumption... or anything altruistic... All he's done is build the most intrusive tool of surveillance; the greatest autocratic enabler in the history of the planet... Is he happy with his life choices? Does he think he's some great innovator? Has he seen the dogshit that's spread on Facebook? Does he see the vacuous piece of shit he's created and think that's a job well done? I dunno man... Zuckerberg makes me question my existence more than anything in my own life ever has.","They probably believe that hey are actually doing something humanitarian. Silicon Valley Tech people often believe they are at the forefront of the technological revolution, changing the world into something better. Or at least something technologically more advanced. It's crazy how removed they are from the rest of the world if you read some of their blog posts or interviews.","This is a nice thought but totally not true. You might want to look up analysis of FB's takeover of Instagram five years ago. That was all Zuckerberg's idea, and by all accounts he did all the negotiating. People in Silicon Valley were laughing at the super high price. 5 years later and Zuckerberg looks like a genius, and the critics look like idiots.","Mr Collins letter made the request in the strongest possible terms, and suggested that Mr Zuckerberg himself should appear. He gave until Monday evening to reply to the request. Facebook has now replied, on a letter dated March 26","\"Reply by Monday? Fuck you. We'll reply Tuesday morning saying no and tell you it's Monday, how'd you like those apples?\"","Seriously, for a platform that's known for making instantaneous communication possible, that's a massive middle finger.","See the problem is \"the strongest possible terms\" in the UK looks like nothing more than a polite request to an American. There is a massive communication barrier between UK and US. We may both speak English but it is not the same at all.","I can actually see this as the right thing to do. His sending the CTO and CPO. They probably have a lot clearer understanding of this area of Facebooks business. The smart image move would be for him to go to the hearing also, as a show of good fate. Even if he wasn't going to answer questions.","The guy is probably in the middle of a breakdown. Do not pity him. He is not a good person and he needs to recuse himself from the company. If the company is going to survive, it will be on his own realization that his self importance got in the way of profit","Well, his social anxiety issues won't help him infront of the British Parliament. He would have sweated like a pig, like in that interview. Funny how the CEO & founder of the biggest social media isn't social in real life. Also, I hope British Parliament takes his action as a slap on the face and implements some drastic laws against Facebook's bullshit."],"isopubdate":""}

Two former US officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","\"I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 (roughly Rs. 26 lakhs) per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the \"maximum exposure\" could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million (roughly Rs. 39 crores) to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more - likely in the tens of millions - because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user's list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend's demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","\"They say 'trust us,' but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement.","Rep. Adam Schiff, Calif., the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","\"I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,\" Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. \"There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms.\"","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other US lawmakers, the European Union's justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","\"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,\" Collins said Sunday. \"It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.\"","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","\"We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,\" Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, said in the statement. \"That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.\"","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a \"breach\" of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook's request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor's role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theatre, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook's privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica's app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ecree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, \"We've heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.\" That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend's data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday, \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, \"bespeaks the same recklessness with its users' data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.\"","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","\"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,\" Rich said. \"They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.\"","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users' sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users' friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users' explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers' consent before \"enacting changes that override their privacy practices,\" the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","\"This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can't do the job.\"","The rising clamour on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., also criticized Facebook on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"","\"Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they're above the rules that apply to everybody else,\" Rubio said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

(Photographer: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg).","Despite the recent lack of public visibility from Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, during the Cambridge Analytica crisis until he broke cover to talk to CNN, some pundits are asking whether he should have acted sooner in addressing matters. While admitting that the social media giant was “not on top of a number of issues” during the U.S. presidential elections, will it be enough to appease shareholders and others?","While Zuckerberg apologized for the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he said Facebook would be contacting millions of people whose data might have been misused by the political consultancy and admitted the company was locked in a tech race to stop Russian election saboteurs. This all came after reports last weekend that Cambridge Analytica had collected personalized data on around 50 million users without their consent.","Britain’s Culture Secretary, Matt Hancock, meanwhile said he did not think the changes indicated by the Facebook CEO go far enough. The Minister further indicated that laws to end the “Wild West” of the Internet would be introduced in due course.","Facebook shares have not been left unscathed by the scandal. The stock was trading down $4.50 (-2.66%) at $164.89 a pop in New York yesterday on Nasdaq at 4.00 pm (EST) by the close, and are now standing where they were late last September and prior to that on July 21, 2017.","While the stock is down around 14.5% from its peak of $193.01 reached last month on February 1, it was still up 18% over the level of $139.59 seen a year ago (March 22, 2017).","Of course, when referring to “without consent” in relation to the collection of Facebook users’ data, this is where things get a little cloudy. And, while phrases and words like “data breach” and “hack” have been used by some media channels, it not entirely true.","In fact, what occurred was that users of Facebook voluntarily responded to surveys created by Cambridge Analytica by way of participating in an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.”","Still, it did not prevent Facebook’s stock price sliding on the back of the ensuing scandal and furore. The shares gave up almost 4% this Monday, a further 4.8% by midday on Tuesday (March 20) and $4.50 yesterday. They are now around $28 below the peak at the start of last month.","As an aside, President Trump’s announced move to impose $60 billion worth of tariffs on a number of Chinese products and introduce barriers to Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) entering the U.S. hasn’t exactly helped the mood of the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 yesterday shed nearly 3%.","And, now there is even a petition in the U.K. that has been launched calling for Zuckerberg to testify to the British Parliament and to the U.S. Senate to answer questions. Having so far been signed by around 130,000 people at the time of writing, the e-petitioners also called for Facebook to “investigate and list any other violations publicly of our data by other third parties.”","“On one hand, it is quite surprising that Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not communicated on a timely basis to reassure shareholders and the public regarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” said Dr Michael Koch at the Kent Business School at the University of Kent, who lecturers in Human Resource Management & Organisational Behaviour.","The lecturer, who formerly worked as a consultant at the Human Capital Group of Towers Perrin (now Willis Towers Watson), a leading HR consultancy, added: “In such a case, you would expect the CEO of a company to react very swiftly to defuse the situation as well as possible, especially since the Facebook share price is sliding.”","Given that Koch’s academic credentials include a Master’s degree in Human Resource Management and Employment Relations from Université Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne and a PhD in Management, he would seem well placed to pass comment.","On the other hand, according to Dr Koch, a German national: “This is a very delicate situation for Facebook, considering that this scandal, which involves sharing data about Facebook users, touches the heart of the social media giant’s business model. Any statement by Zuckerberg is likely to have strong implications for the way Facebook conducts their business and respects their users’ rights.”","Regulators on both sides of the Pond are also increasingly aware of the need to address Facebook’s problems. The whole scandal around Cambridge Analytica, which was exposed on TV by Britain’s Channel 4 News in an undercover investigation, goes to the heart of democracy in the western world.","It might well be that Facebook is “still trying to devise a proper communication strategy,” posited Koch, who previously worked at Swansea University and EMLYON Business School, and in 2015 co-authored the book, The Way To the Top: Career Patterns of Fortune 100 CEOs, with Bernard Forgues and Vanessa Monties.","Or, as Dr Koch put it just prior to Zuckerberg’s interview with CNN: “Management intends to ride out the worst of the storm before Zuckerberg issues any communication.” In the past, Facebook has been faced with similar problems, which have not created a similar backlash. So perhaps management has been surprised by the extent of the negative reactions.","Roger Lawson, ex-chairman of the UK Individual Shareholders Society (ShareSoc), a campaigning group with over 2,000 members, a seasoned investor who has Facebook account, remarked today: “It certainly helps if listed companies are upfront about problem(s) concerning their business operations and admitting failings early on. That said, I’m not entirely clear on what information was released and why Facebook might have been to blame.\" And, Lawson suggested Zuckerberg \"may have admitted more\" than he actually had to.","While adding that the \"main people to blame are the perpetrators who collected the information”, he nevertheless acknowledgeed that the social media giant was \"perhaps at fault by allowing it to happen\" in the first place.","Responsible Companies","Joakim Lundquist, Founder and CEO of digital communications agency Lundquist srl in Italy, commenting in light of the scandal said: “More responsible companies are asking themselves what their role should be in terms of allocating ad budget to ensure the platforms and content they invest in have a positive impact on society.”","Speaking from Milan, the Swede with around 20 years’ experience in corporate communications and a background in media relations, added: “Facebook and Google dominate online advertising globally, so in a world of fake news, hate speech and child pornography, they are in the spotlight on this front.”","Unilever, the consumer goods giant, which was ranked No.5 in the latest Lundquist CSR Online Awards in Europe, in fact made one of the boldest moves in this space yet by threatening to pull investment from platforms, which breed division or fail to protect children from toxic content. It called on social media to build social responsibility. (Note: Unilever’s general position on responsible marketing and advertising can be read via this link).","But for Facebook the big question according to Lundquist is whether major advertisers “will put their own sense of responsibility above the allure of reaching the company’s two billion users.”","In relation to that, Facebook was scheduled for a crunch meeting and talks today with major advertisers after ISBA, the trade body that represents the leading U.K. advertisers, indicated that around 3,000 - including P&G and Unilever, were ready to cut links.","The position of ISBA is that the use of personal data is governed by the Data Protection Act, which prohibits use without consent, except in exceptional circumstances.","And, big brands - not just European but global ones too - were reported last November to be pulling YouTube ads over advertising issues. News agency Reuters reported that confectionery maker Mondelez, Lidl, Mars and other consumer goods producers pulled their advertising from YouTube. This followed The Times newspaper in Britain finding that the video-sharing site was displaying clips of scantily clad children alongside the adverts of major brands.","Facebook Users & Shareholders","Phil Bak, CEO at Exponential ETFs, an asset manager dedicated to providing exchange traded funds, who oversees the firm’s American Consumer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF (ACSI) and their Reverse Cap Weighted US Large Cap ETF (RVRS) that both have holdings in Facebook, commenting said: “Zuckerberg may be addressing Facebook’s users and shareholders, but ultimately it is the advertisers who are his customers, and who must be reassured that their investments in Facebook advertising will not backfire on them.”","The firm’s American Customer Satisfaction Investable Index, with all the securities within it listed on a major U.S. stock exchange, utilizes proprietary customer satisfaction scores to weight stocks within each sector by their relative customer satisfaction scores.","Bak, who was previously a Managing Director at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) where he worked with asset managers, regulators and liquidity providers to ensure a fair and orderly secondary market for ETFs, added: “Facebook’s growth trajectory is dependent on the satisfaction of its advertisers and the efficacy of their ad spend. If data usage is a moving target and advertising firms will be seen as unfriendly to the users, then Facebook has a limited value proposition to sell to those advertisers.”","Perspective on Facebook’s Stock","Neil Wilson, senior markets analyst at brokerage ETX Capital in The City of London, commenting in relation to Facebook’s shares, said: “What we are seeing now in terms of the sell-off in Facebook shares is the market applying a discount based on a couple of new headwinds for the stock.”","He added: “One is the reputational damage - the risk that consumers ditch the platform. This looks suspect as the tentacles and reach of this beast go a long way and it is hard to see consumers meaningfully abandon the platform. Where else would they go?”","A second headwind is regulatory pressures. Namely the threat of greater regulation, which might affect the company’s data-driven online advertising model.","Concurring broadly with Exponential ETFs’ Bak, Wilson, a London-based Scot, posited: “The entire investment thesis is based on selling data to advertisers and other companies and the scandal throws doubt on that. So we see a discount attached to the stock that was not there before.”","Facebook’s Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio at about 27 now is down a fair bit and may in fact “better reflect the risk associated with the platform’s earnings growth potential” according Wilson.","Versus Twitter’s P/E of about 96, Facebook’s P/E (26.76) makes it look relatively cheap. However, Twitter is a very different social media platform and one that does not depend on harvesting and selling such deep and rich data on its users. Google is better for comparison in terms of the Internet oligopoly and is trading around 32 times earnings, with its shares having declined by about 10% over the last fortnight.","Now while the hashtag #deletefacebook has trended on Twitter and Facebook’s market capitalization has fallen by over $60 billion, it is premature to talk of a doomsday scenario for the company just yet.","Siim Õunap, an Estonian FX and cryptocurrency trader who studied Technology Management at university in Denmark and correctly called the recent decline in Bitcoin's value, asserted: “Facebook is too large of a giant with over 2 billion users for this scandal to have any permanent effect. The majority of users are not going to stop using the platform despite the breach, and as such Facebook and its stock price will recover. However, that aside the privacy and information security topic just went to a whole new level.”","Whatever else, this story has a lot further to run. And, no doubt Mark Zuckerberg will be facing the politicians on both sides of the Pond before long to respond further. But as Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, who applauded Channel 4 News’ reporting to TV anchor Jon Snow when interviewed this week said, the Cambridge Analytica data debacle is a “serious moment for the web’s future.” Few would doubt that.","I am a freelance financial journalist based in London and former FT staff writer covering stock exchanges and transaction services.

{"originalurl":"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/cambridge-analytica-mindset-revolution/1459760#wA81lmQRJsDjbZW2.99","title":"Cambridge Analytica and the mindset revolution","text":["This weekend, the press and the Twittersphere were alight with news that mysterious, Trump-backing data-driven marketing firm Cambridge Analytica have been kicked off Facebook for violating the platform’s data collection policies. Cue lots of commentary about what it is they do, much of which has leapt breathlessly to the obscure details.","If you judged by the news cycle alone, you would assume that Cambridge Analytica had invented some entirely new way of marketing, that tapped straight into our deepest fears and insecurities, and that Facebook had booted them off in horror at this gross and intrusive innovation into our inmost psyches.","Fortunately, the shock-and-awe coverage misses the point. Cambridge Analytica’s approach is not entirely unique, and they have been excluded from Facebook because of how they did it, which was a breach of the platform’s terms, not for what they did.","I know this, because my team do something similar. When we founded Wavemaker at the start of 2018, we brought our audience research specialists and our programmatic marketing experts into one team (known as TAPP), because we recognised that understanding people and targeting media towards them are two sides of the same coin. Modern media needs to move people as individuals or as small groups, not just en masse – and that means getting closer to their individual motivations, and finding ways to target advertising to specific people with specific mindsets, not just broad demographics. We call this precision marketing (and judging from Marc Pritchard’s comments at ISBA a few weeks ago, we’re not alone).","There are two parts to precision marketing. The first is good old-fashioned attitudinal or psychographic segmentation. This has always been one of the most useful items in any brand marketer’s toolbox. By understanding buyers based on their reasons for buying – their attitudes, values, needs and worldviews – you can get to a far richer understanding and build stronger brands, products, propositions and communications.","In media, though, we’ve always tended to sneer a bit at psychographic segmentation) remind me, are we trying to reach Struggling Jugglers or Juggling Strugglers?) but that’s largely because our ways of targeting media had no overlap with these inner-life profiles beloved of consumer insight teams. This is changing, and fast, with the arrival of the second element that makes precision marketing a possibility: very large data sets of millions or billions of individual profiles, which can be connected to addressable media.","Within our TAPP team, we create psychographic and purchasing-behaviour segments using established research methods, and match these into large, privacy-compliant customer pools, especially Group M’s [m]Platform, to identify dozens or hundreds of individual digital behaviours that predict individual mindsets, brand attitudes, or needs. We use these to build specific media targets (online and off) so we reach the right people with the most interesting, relevant advertising. There’s very little voodoo about any of this – it just needs proper researchers, data scientists and digital experts sitting together to make it happen.","Cambridge Analytica’s method of doing this was not revolutionary – beside the alleged non-compliance of their data, they were matching psychographic segments to Facebook likes, which is barely scratching the surface of predictive analytics. But the approach – audience research meets big data meets precision media – is starting to change how we use media to move people.","When we understand people better, we can be more interesting and useful. Nor should any of this be done in secret – research ethics, data ethics and media ethics need to be part of an open discussion about the role that advertisers, the media, and even politicians play in our society."],"isopubdate":""}

Watch what Alex Stamos does next","text":["Worried about Facebook's coziness with Trump? Watch what Alex Stamos does next","Interesting piece on Re/Code this morning about the “secret meeting” of Valley engineers who fear that Trump is very, very bad for tech.","They’re right of course, and they’re also right when they talk about the potential for an engineers’ strike to grind major tech companies to a halt.","And yet, Re/Code still managed to bury the lede by breezing past a mention of one significant attendee…","The rules say all attendees are granted anonymity unless willing to be outed, which made Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos’s appearance all the more significant. He declined to comment, but did give Recode permission to print his name.","And that’s all the piece had to say about Alex Stamos. Which is a shame because simply describing Stamos as Facebook’s CSO doesn’t do him - or his appearance at the meeting - justice. In fact, taken at face value it almost suggests that Facebook had send such a high ranking exec to a “secret meeting” of rank and file techies to keep tabs on potentially troublesome workers.","The truth is something far more interesting, and far more encouraging.","It’s certainly true to say that Stamos is a high ranking Facebook exec, but he’s also something else: The canary in the coal mine. Anyone worried about Zuckerberg and Sandberg’s willingness to cosy up to Trump (and in Zuck’s case, his increasingly weird willingess to cosy up to ultra-nationalist demagogues and authoritarian regimes generally) should keep a very close eye on what Stamos does next.","For one thing, it’s hard to find a bio of Stamos that doesn’t include the phrase “vocal NSA critic.” Back in 2014, when Stamos joined Yahoo as its CSO, Entrepreneur magazine described him thus:","Stamos is known for his condemnatory stance on the NSA’s PRISM surveillance program.","Just last month, on Feb. 27, the University of California, Berkeley electrical engineering and computer science program graduate delivered the opening and closing remarks at TrustyCon, a security “counter-conference” held in San Francisco specifically to protest the RSA Conference, and the security firm’s now not-so-secret $10 million contract with the NSA.","Stamos, a key TrustyCon organizer, joined a group of fellow high-level security industry leaders in boycotting the RSA’s event from directly across the street from the venue.","The article, which cited Stamos's appearance at conferences like DEFCON and Black Hat, also linked to this post on Stamos’ own blog about the dangers and possibilities of PRISM.","A year later, now at Yahoo, Stamos “clashed” with the director of the NSA over the agency’s demands for backdoors to access encrypted user data. Per the BBC…","A Yahoo executive has publicly challenged the National Security Agency (NSA) over encryption \"backdoors\".","Alex Stamos pressed NSA director Adm Mike Rogers on whether the access to encrypted data requested by the US authorities should also be granted to the Russian and Chinese governments.","A few months later, it was reported that Stamos had been “poached” by Facebook. In fact, as Reuters revealed in 2016, Stamos resigned from Yahoo after discovering that his employer had agreed to pass data to the American government.","According to two of the former employees, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's decision to obey the directive roiled some senior executives and led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now holds the top security job at Facebook Inc.","Which brings us to this week’s “secret meeting” and Stamos’ willingness to be mentioned by name as an attendee.","Everything happening at Facebook right now suggests a company that wants to make Donald Trump and his supporters on the right happy. Facebook’s policy team is already chock full of right-wingers, and the company is still hiring. When not perched behind bottles of Trump water at Trump Tower, senior executives have met with prominent conservative publishers, journalists and politicians to reassure them that the company won’t “censor” conservative news sources, including those peddling fake news. The company’s efforts to weed out fake news have been lackluster at best. And let’s not forget that Peter Thiel (also a Pando investor, for the love of God) remains a Facebook board member despite his hugely conflicting role on Donald Trump’s transition team.","Facebook would deny any cosiness, of course, and you can bet ya bottom dollar the company will soon announce a bunch of product and policy sops designed to appeal to left wingers.","And yet, nobody in their right mind believes that the Trump administration, leaning on the mutual Thiel connection, won’t try to get Facebook to do its bidding. The “best” case scenario is a demand that pro-Trump news be given more prominence and anti-Trump critics be shushed. More likely, and more terrifying, is an increase in demands for data on those same critics, and a broader policy of forcing tech companies to share more information with the NSA and similar agencies. We saw that start under Obama and Trump has already talked about building a Muslim database and asking tech leaders to “shut down” parts of the Internet which he doesn’t like.","The question is whether Facebook continues to try to keep Trump happy when those requests start rolling in (see also: requests to hire fewer immigrants or, even worse, to share information on those immigrants currently employed.)","In that regard, at least based on past performance, Alex Stamos is someone to whom we should all be paying attention. And in that context the timing of his very public attendance at an anti-Trump meeting looks a lot like a shot across the bows of his own employer.","Should Stamos suddenly get “poached” by another company or decide to leave Facebook for some other unspecified reason, the rest of us should probably take that as a cue to get our data as far away from Mark Zuckerberg’s servers as possible."],"isopubdate":"2017-01-10"}

That’s because the outcome of presidential elections often hinges on just a few thousand votes (just 11,602 in Michigan, for example) in key battleground states, as we saw in 2016.","To hack an election, you’ll want to target the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all of which had reasonably close outcomes.

The exact same ad run a year ago would have gotten much higher engagement rates, which means more visibility at less cost. How high would the engagement rates have been? We used average ad fatigue data to model and extrapolate what a likely engagement rate would have been a year ago.","Based on this data we computed the cost to reach and the cost to engage with a number of people equal to the margin of victory in the swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania using Facebook Ads and fake news, as follows:","Facebook: Profiting from Fake News","The total cost of this test: $53.58.","Minutes after the campaign exhausted its budget, this receipt was sent to me by email.","My Facebook Fake News Experiment: Closing Thoughts","a) It’s still way too easy to become a fake news publisher on Facebook.

It’s not hard to believe that it could impact voting behavior and even an election outcome in battleground states where the margin of victory was just a few thousand votes.

(Jeff Chiu / AP)","Ally MarottiChicago Tribune","Cook County is suing Facebook and Cambridge Analytica for allegedly violating an Illinois fraud law after reports that the political consulting firm used ill-gotten Facebook data in an effort to influence voter behavior.","Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump’s campaign, deceived the millions of Illinois Facebook users whose information it collected, alleges the lawsuit, filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court. And Facebook failed to protect its users’ privacy and misrepresented how their data would be used, the lawsuit says.","“(Facebook) sought to keep developers building on its platform and provide companies with all the tools they need to influence and manipulate user behavior,” the suit says. “That’s because Facebook is not a social media company; it is the largest data mining operation in existence.”","Facebook said it could not comment immediately on the lawsuit, and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment.","The lawsuit joins others brought against the social media giant and Cambridge Analytica in response to a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London earlier this month. The newspapers reported that Cambridge Analytica, whose U.K.-based parent SCL Group was also named in Cook County’s suit, gained access to private information of more than 50 million Facebook users, including their profiles, locations and what they like. The firm claimed its tools could analyze voters’ personalities and influence their behavior with targeted messages.","At least five lawsuits have been filed in federal court in Northern California over the alleged misuse of user data. Those include a suit from a Facebook shareholder who is seeking class-action status, claiming he and other company shareholders have suffered losses and damages since the Cambridge Analytica news was first reported, and another from a woman seeking class-action status over Facebook and Cambridge Analytica’s alleged improper data collection.","Since the report about Cambridge Analytica was published, a public conversation about deleting Facebook profiles has sprung up, and the privacy of people’s online information has come into question. Some experts say that deleting a Facebook profile can’t protect the more than a decade’s worth of data that users have already poured into the platform.","The Federal Trade Commission on Monday confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook’s data practices, and 37 state attorneys general, including Illinois’ Lisa Madigan, sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg demanding answers about the company’s practices and privacy protections. Meanwhile, U.K. investigators reportedly raided Cambridge Analytica’s offices in London late last week.","Zuckerberg said in a post last week that the company took steps several years ago to make sure users’ data aren’t accessed this way again. He also promised that the company would do more to protect its users’ data. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” he wrote.","Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired the information, Facebook has said, but it didn’t steal the data. Users allowed the maker of a personality quiz app to take the data. About 270,000 people took the quiz several years ago, and the app-maker was able to scrape data from their Facebook friends. He then provided the data to Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica, a London-based political consulting firm, has been accused of using ill-gotten Facebook data to influence voter behavior in the 2016 election.","Cambridge Analytica, a London-based political consulting firm, has been accused of using ill-gotten Facebook data to influence voter behavior in the 2016 election.","Still, Facebook told its users that their personal data would be protected, according to the Cook County lawsuit. It engaged in unfair and deceptive conduct when it allowed a third party to collect its users’ data, the suit alleges.","The lawsuit, filed by Cook County State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx on behalf of Illinois residents, brings one count each against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica for allegedly violating the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.","The suit asks that both companies be fined $50,000 for each Illinois user whose data was accessed and that Cambridge Analytica be fined an additional $10,000 for each day a violation affecting an Illinois resident age 65 or older has existed.","The companies “must be held accountable for their actions,” Foxx said in a statement.","“Cambridge Analytica deliberately misled Facebook users so it could build psychological profiles of the user and their friends, and Facebook did not stop it,” she said. “This blatant deception violated Illinois law and more importantly violated the privacy of Illinois residents.”","Cook County is being represented by Chicago law firm Edelson, which has brought privacy suits against Facebook and other tech companies, including Google and Netflix.","Cambridge Analytica has previously denied any wrongdoing and suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix. The app developer, Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who is not named in the Cook County suit, told the BBC last week that he didn’t know the data would be used for Trump’s election campaign and that Cambridge Analytica is using him as a scapegoat.","Internet security advocates have argued that there aren’t enough laws to protect consumer privacy. Companies often lean on terms of service that consumers sign before using an app or service, but few actually read that fine print. Even if they do, some experts say it is nearly impossible for users to know the extent to which their data could be used.","That’s increasingly a problem in a world where technology companies are building their businesses on data collection, and it’s illustrated in this case, said Alvaro Bedoya, who runs the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center. The basis of the lawsuit is that what happened with Cambridge Analytica on Facebook wasn’t an accident: It was Facebook’s business model, Bedoya said.","“This thing didn’t just happen to a couple users in California or New York, this happened to millions of people,” he said. “Frankly, it’s the tip of the iceberg.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.","Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.","Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\"","Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.","In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted all of it.","Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act \"and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.","Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign.

The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."],"isopubdate":"2181-06-27"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

No, people will not spend as much time on the site, the company said as it reported quarterly financial results. But don’t worry, Facebook added, because the changes will ultimately benefit its business.","With the adjustments to what it shows on its site, “I believe that the time spent on Facebook will be more valuable,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. “If people interact more, it should lead to stronger community. When you care about something, you’re willing to see ads to experience it.”","The scrutiny followed changes that Facebook announced in January to its News Feed, the scrolling screen of content that the social network’s more than two billion members see when they log in to the site. After months of criticism over the harmful effects of the social network, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook wanted to emphasize more “meaningful” content, such as photos and posts that friends and family have interacted with, and would play down articles from publishers. At the time, Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the shift might cause people to spend less time on Facebook, at least in the short run.","That has already proven to be true in some instances, Facebook revealed on Wednesday. The shift to more meaningful content has just started rolling out, but the company made other changes last year as a precursor to the latest moves, including cutting down on viral videos. In response, Facebook users over all reduced the time they spent on the platform by roughly 50 million hours a day, Mr. Zuckerberg said, which translates to about two minutes a day for each of the company’s 1.4 billion daily users.","Other measures of engagement also fell. The company said the number of people in the United States and Canada who use Facebook on a daily basis fell for the first time ever in last year’s fourth quarter, dropping to 184 million from 185 million a year earlier.","Mr. Zuckerberg said these declines were just fluctuations as Facebook made changes to its platform. Over all, the total number of people who use Facebook monthly jumped 14 percent in the fourth quarter to 2.13 billion users, which is a rate of growth that is far higher than that of many other social media companies.","“We have a responsibility to fully understand how our services are used and amplify the good,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.","His comments came as Facebook reported another set of blockbuster financial results. The company said its revenue surged by 47 percent to nearly $13 billion in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while profit rose 56 percent to $4.3 billion. The social network also said it had taken a $2.3 billion charge to cover the repatriation of foreign earnings under the new tax code that was signed into law last month.","Facebook also continued to spend ferociously over the fourth quarter, with capital expenditures reaching $2.3 billion. The company said its number of employees increased 47 percent from a year ago to 25,105 people.","Facebook spent much of last year grappling with questions about whether it had become a force for ill. The company disclosed that it been manipulated by Russian agents who were trying to sway the result of the 2016 elections; Facebook faced a grilling by lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the situation.","Other social media companies were also exploited for the same purpose, including Twitter, which said on Wednesday that it had informed 1.4 million people in the United States that they had interacted with Russian propaganda on the service, up from a previous number of 677,775 people.","“Facebook has taken a conciliatory tone in terms of coming to terms with its power over advertising and how people interact and engage with each other,” said Debra Williamson, an analyst with research firm eMarketer. She said that the changes to the News Feed showed that Facebook was not afraid to experiment with their core products.","Even with the changes to the News Feed, Facebook’s robust revenue is a salve for investors, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.","“Those concerns haven’t shown up in the numbers, at least not yet,” he said, adding that most investors were focusing on how Facebook was raising revenue “at a remarkable pace.”","Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @sheeraf","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Facebook Chief Tries to Soothe Wall Street Over Changes to Site’s News Feed.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Related Coverage","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people.

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

Its technology was also credited with swinging the Brexit referendum. But then Cambridge Analytica downplayed its role, and the Leave EU gang, who had been so keen to talk up its presence, also decided they weren’t involved, really. But now Cambridge Analytica is back in the news, and for all the wrong reasons.","The company has had its Facebook presence suspended, which may raise a few eyebrows. Why should a social media provider pull the presence of a company that does nothing more than analyse data? Ah well. After telling “We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies. They cannot buy ads or administer its clients' pages”, the man from Facebook spelled it out.","“They certified deleting user data they received from an app developer in 2015 but we have since learned that not all of it may have been removed. This is a clear violation of our policies and terms of service … we are still looking into these issues so will share more as we get deeper”. It’s a data breach. And it’s a serious one.","Facebook’s official statement explains “In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica … Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. Approximately 270k people downloaded the app”.","And what was that information? “In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it”.","So what action was taken when this was discovered? “By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica … he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan … certified to us that they destroyed the data”.","There may be trouble ahead ...","Except CA did not delete all that data. And for anyone still shrugging shoulders and responding “so what?”, both the Brexit referendum and the US Presidential Election came the year after Facebook discovered the violation, and CA said they’d deleted the info.","... and someone will be facing the music very soon","So the not-actually-deleted data was still there during those campaigns. That, folks, is why this discovery matters, why it is a big story, and why you should be concerned. And just how big a story we will find out very soon. How that might occur cannot be told at present, but Carole Cadwalladr of the Observer has mused “Waking up to the news that Facebook has suspended Cambridge Analytica today? TWO YEARS after it discovered massive data breach? Wondering why now? Answers coming soon”.","Ms Cadwalladr’s paper comes out tomorrow. I’ll just leave that one there.","[UPDATE 1400 hours: tomorrow's Observer feature has been made available online already, and in it Carole Cadwalladr reveals that the personal information of more than 50 million individuals was harvested and used improperly in what must be one of the biggest and most embarrassing - for Facebook, at least - data breaches ever.","Most of those whose data was harvested were registered US voters. Confirmation has come from a whistleblower, who has passed what he knows to the National Crime Agency's cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner's office.","What information might have been harvested on voters in the UK is not known. But what can be told is that the Observer article is only the first instalment: there will be more from other media outlets very soon.","Those who sneeringly labelled Ms Cadwalladr, and others involved in bringing this story into the open, as mere tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists were plain flat wrong. And embarrassingly so]","You like 'evidence', Anon. The evidence from your posts everyday shows that you love spitting too.Could you give some evidence , in the form of quotations, verbatim if possible, of these people who 'spit hatred' at Russia?","Not difficult. Comments on every topic. A tone of spittle-flecked ranting. Well-informed but paranoid approach to all topics. Hatred of anything to do with the London area (and,come to that, hatred of anything much). An unusual and possibly nostalgic defence of anything Russian. Tendency to defuse the effect of Tim's considered and carefully evidenced articles by Spart-style juvenile ranting, though knowledge and affiliations indicate anything-but-juvenile actual vintage.","We can often tell it is a specific Anonymous who has posted before through the way they construct their comments and sentences. Also they repeat certain words in many of the comments, such as calling everyone 'far-right,' whether or not they fit.","The above is what I was going to say before I saw Cynthia's comment, but that comment is a better answer than mine."],"isopubdate":""}

The social media platform that started out as a safe-seeming sandbox for sharing details with friends and family about our lives? Over the weekend, Facebook’s 2.2 billion active users might finally have gotten the message that it’s not that way any longer, if it ever was.","On Saturday, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling startup flush with a $15 million investment from right-wing Republican Robert Mercer, harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users — without their permission. Christopher Wylie, a Cambridge Analytica founder-turned-whistleblower, told the Times that his former bosses “want to fight a culture war in America,” shaping data into the sharp end of the spear.","Facebook responded with all the bluster of a corporate tech giant. Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth deflected urgent questions by quibbling over terminology, saying, “This was unequivocally not a data breach,” according to BloombergTechnology. Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, defended the company on Twitter, then, according to Recode, tried to delete his tweets — proving the truism that social media can make any reputational hit geometrically worse.","Advertisement","Recode and other sites tell how bad actors from Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data: A developer created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that used a feature called Facebook Login to vacuum up a range of personal information from those who opted in. Because of Facebook’s sprawling network, the 270,000 who opted in opened up a treasure trove of data from 50 million users.","To some extent, this is what Facebook is made for: Its propulsive growth has been fueled by the simple human desire to share trials and triumphs. And most users are aware they’re sacrificing some privacy to advertisers who note their habits and likes, but are willing to accept a few trade-offs in order to facilitate a friction-free stream of conversation and commerce. Facebook says it has since changed its terms of service, the voluminous “fine print” that few users take time to read through to the end.","But the Facebook user agreement shouldn’t be the go-to regulation for protecting US consumers or governing ethics online. That’s the job of elected officials. Commendably, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey launched a state investigation on Saturday. Calls for congressional hearings came from US Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee. One potential remedy is already on the books: In 2011, Facebook settled charges by the Federal Trade Commission that it deceived users by promising privacy; new violations could result in stiff fines.","But consumers don’t yet even know what information was stolen, or when. If it’s unrealistic to expect a return to that safe sandbox, state and federal officials can at least bring clarity to the rules of the playground."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Advertisement - story continues below","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Do you think this company helped Trump win the election as Facebook claims?","YesNo","Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge.

It may also raise new questions for the social media companies and for Kushner.","Alexander Vershbow, who was a US ambassador to Russia under George W Bush and to Nato under Bill Clinton, said the Russian state institutions were frequently used as “tools for Putin’s pet political projects”.","Vershbow said the findings were concerning in light of efforts by Moscow to disrupt US democracy and public debate. “There clearly was a wider plan, despite Putin’s protestations to the contrary,” he said.","The investments are detailed in the Paradise Papers, a trove of millions of leaked documents reviewed by the Guardian, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and other partners, along with other previously unreported filings.","Facebook and Twitter were not made aware that funding for the investments came from the state-controlled VTB Bank and a financial arm of the state oil and gas firm Gazprom, according to Milner.","The files show that in 2011, VTB funded a $191m investment in Twitter. About the same time, Gazprom Investholding financed an opaque offshore company, which in turn funded a vehicle that held $1bn-worth of Facebook shares.","The money flowed through investment vehicles controlled by Milner, who in 2015 invested in a startup in New York that Kushner co-owns with his brother. Kushner initially failed to disclose his own holding in the startup, Cadre, when he joined Trump’s White House. A spokesman for Kushner declined to comment.","Milner once advised the Russian government on technology through a presidential commission chaired by Dmitry Medvedev, the former president and current prime minister. Now based in California’s Silicon Valley, Milner has invested $7bn in more than 30 online companies including Airbnb, Spotify and the Chinese retailers Alibaba and JD.com.","In a series of interviews, Milner said VTB’s funding did not buy it influence at Twitter. He said he was not aware that Gazprom Investholding had backed the stake in Facebook. Milner said the deals were a small part of his overall investment portfolio and were done when US-Russia relations were better.","Milner disputes that he is an associate of Kushner. He said he had invested in Kushner’s business purely for commercial reasons. He said they had met only once, over cocktails in the US last year. “I’m not involved in any political activity. I’m not funding any political activity,” said Milner.","I’m not involved in any political activity. I’m not funding any political activity","Yuri Milner","The disclosure that stakes in two of the US’s biggest technology companies were financed by Russian entities with links to the Kremlin comes as the covert use of their platforms by Russians aiming to boost Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign is under intense scrutiny. Both VTB and Gazprom are now under US sanctions.","Though Milner said the investments had no connection to the controversy, the findings are likely to add to pressure on Facebook and Twitter to give a full and transparent account of their interactions with Moscow entities before and during the US election.","Vanessa Chan, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said the investment backed by Gazprom Investholding had been sold five years ago, after Facebook went public. Chan said Facebook “rejected the notion of a lack of due diligence” being done on its investors. A Twitter spokesperson said: “As a matter of policy Twitter conducted reviews of all pre-IPO investors.”","The Twitter and Facebook investments were made by Milner’s investment company DST Global, which was set up in 2009. At the time, Milner joined forces with the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, a co-owner of Arsenal FC, who invested heavily in DST Global funds.","Purchases of Facebook and Twitter were public knowledge and turned out to be lucrative. Usmanov is estimated to have made more than $1bn on his original $200m stake. Usmanov sold the last of his Facebook holdings in September 2013 and Milner said DST Global had sold all stakes in Facebook and Twitter by 2014.","But the role of major state-run Russian banks in funding some stakes – including in Twitter, Trump’s favourite medium – was previously unknown.","Born in Soviet Moscow in 1961, Milner was named after Yuri Gagarin, who had become the first man in outer space earlier that year. Milner studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University and in 1990 moved from the Soviet Union to the US, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.","After a stint at the World Bank in Washington, he returned to Russia and set up Mail.ru, an email and social networking service, which became popular and profitable. In 2009, he was asked to join Medvedev’s innovation commission. Milner said the role involved advising Russian ministers and officials on moving public services online.","Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was so impressed with Milner’s rise that he invited the Russian to invest in Facebook. Milner’s company “stood out because of the global perspective they bring”, Zuckerberg said when announcing their first $200m deal in 2009. “I believe I had some expertise at the time that Mark found valuable,” Milner said.","The pair became friends and Zuckerberg attended Milner’s wedding in California late in 2011. The ceremony was held at a vast mansion atop a hillside near Silicon Valley that Milner had recently bought for $100m. Milner and Zuckerberg are advisers to each other’s philanthropic ventures and remain close.","Associates of Milner told the Guardian that he tried to secure funding for new investments from western banks. But they turned him down, forcing him after the 2008 financial crisis to go instead to Russian institutions. His exit from Moscow followed Putin’s return as president in 2012, as Russia moved in a more authoritarian direction. Milner has lived in the US with his family since 2014.","Milner said that as a management company, DST Global had sole discretion over its investment decisions. He said that he, like other investment managers, did not disclose the identities of his funders to the companies where DST Global invested. He said funders such as VTB received only basic updates on investments.","He briefly mentioned VTB’s role in the Twitter investment during an interview with Forbes magazine last month. The partial disclosure appeared to have been prompted by questions put to him by the Guardian and other media partners.","It is unclear if Moscow saw a political interest in funding stakes in Facebook and Twitter, or if the acquisitions were only intended to make money. Sources familiar with the situation told the Guardian that Facebook had carried out a discreet internal review of Russian investments before its IPO in 2012, and that the review was unable to draw firm conclusions.","Karen Vartapetov, the director of sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor’s, said the Russian government had “a strong influence on VTB’s strategic and business plans” even when these were not expected to be lucrative. “VTB plays a very important role for government policies, including implementation of some less profitable and socially important tasks,” said Vartapetov.","Russia’s role in exploiting Facebook and Twitter to influence the 2016 US election is an important strand of an FBI inquiry and congressional investigations. Facebook has identified 3,000 advertisements and 470 fake accounts on its network that were set up by a “troll factory” in St Petersburg. Details have been passed to Congress and to the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who is examining alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.","VTB has a close relationship with the Kremlin and, according to analysts, has received more state subsidies than any other Russian bank. In 2009, the bank boasted that its investment banking arm was “pivotal in managing the state’s interests”.","VTB also has close ties to Putin’s FSB intelligence agency. The bank’s chairman, Andrey Kostin, is a former KGB foreign intelligence operative, it has been reported, who has received several state decorations from Putin. Milner denied knowing about VTB’s ties to Russian intelligence. VTB funded 45% of the Twitter stake. The bank denies Kostin worked for the KGB.","In an email, Milner’s spokeswoman said: “Yuri Milner has never been an employee of the Russian government.” Milner said he not spoken to Medvedev nor any other Russian minister about social media, and that he and Zuckerberg had not discussed the controversy over Russian exploitation of social media.“Politics is something I’m very uninterested in,” Milner told the Guardian.","‘They operate in the shadows’","The Paradise Papers help to unravel complex arrangements that led Russian state money to fund investments in the US social media companies.","They involve a bewildering array of companies using similar names and acronyms, someregistered offshore in places that offer secrecy about ownership. The arrangements are legal, but have led campaigners to demand more transparency.","The trail begins in December 2005, when Gazprom Investholding began putting money into Kanton Services, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Usmanov was at the time general director of Gazprom Investholding, which the Kremlin has used to renationalise assets sold off in the 1990s.","Gazprom in effect took control of Kanton in 2009 in return for $920m. In 2011, Kanton in turn took a majority stake in DST USA II, a vehicle publicly associated with Milner. By 2012, DST USA II had bought more than 50m shares in Facebook, according to filings at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, amounting to more than 3% of the social media company.","Over the following months, ownership of DST USA II was transferred to an Usmanov company, which sold off $1bn worth of the shares in Facebook at a significant profit after the social network floated on the stock market.","The ultimate owner of Kanton was not made clear, but the company has several ties to Usmanov. An executive who dealt with Kanton on another deal, who requested anonymity to discuss private details, said: “I was led to believe this was one of Usmanov’s investment companies.”","Milner said he knew who owned Kanton but declined to name them, citing a confidentiality agreement. He said he did not know where Usmanov and his other partners obtained funding. “I had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us – he had enough funds already from the holdings that he owned,” said Milner.","Russia's influence operations are intentionally opaque","Alina Polyakova","Rollo Head, a spokesman for Usmanov, said in an email: “To be absolutely clear, Mr Usmanov did not borrow from or use state or quasi-state funds to make investments in Facebook.”","Alina Polyakova, a specialist in Russian foreign policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Moscow frequently used intermediaries to ensure “plausible deniability” for the actions of senior officials.","“Russia’s influence over operations – whether that be allocating funds for disinformation campaigns or providing financing to extremist movements, or others – are intentionally opaque,” said Polyakova. “They operate in the shadows.”","The leaked documents, together with public filings, show that VTB funded another offshore investment vehicle, DST Investments 3, which was registered on the Isle of Man, a tax haven and UK crown dependency.","VTB put about $191m into this vehicle, which bought 11m shares in Twitter in 2011. When Twitter was preparing to float on the stock market in 2013, the VTB-funded vehicle held a 2% stake in the company. The VTB-funded stake was sold in May 2014, according to Milner. Stock prices from that time indicate the sale would have returned more than $240m in profit.","In July 2014, shortly before the US imposed sanctions on Russian entities such as VTB and Gazprom over the Kremlin’s aggression in Ukraine, control of DST Investments 3 was transferred to Kanton, the same company tied to Usmanov that was used as a go-between in the Facebook deal.","Milner insisted VTB had been treated like his other investors, but acknowledged it was different in one respect. “VTB Bank is clearly an institution controlled by the Russian government,” he said.","The Russian companies denied that their funding of the investments was politically motivated.","“The loans were provided for general corporate purposes,” said Oleg Maksimov, a spokesman for Gazprom Investholding. A VTB spokesperson said that in 2011 the bank “executed several deals in the high-tech industry, as we considered this field to have high potential” but had since sold its stakes.","Play Video","2:07","What are the Paradise Papers? – video","Russian investor backed Kushner","The disclosure of Milner’s partial backing by Russian state interests may also cause difficulties for Kushner.","Milner in 2015 contributed $850,000 from his family trustto a $50m investment in Cadre, a New-York-based company that Kushner co-founded in 2014 with his brother, Joshua, and a friend of theirs from Harvard. The startup, which the Kushners claim is worth $800m, is based around an online marketplace where wealthy financiers can club together to invest in properties.","Cadre has attracted an estimated $133m of venture capital from backers including Peter Thiel, the controversial libertarian billionaire who co-founded PayPal and backed Trump’s campaign for president in 2016.","The company has already caused controversy for Kushner, after he initially failed to detail his stake in Cadre in financial disclosures to the US Office of Government Ethics. Kushner later added Cadre to revised paperwork, saying his stake in the firm was worth up to $25m.","Cadre initially said in a June press release that Milner’s stake in the company was held through his firm DST. A different version of the release on Cadre’s website said, however, that Milner himself was the investor in Cadre. The breakdown of the $50m funding was not made public by Cadre.","Milner said in an interview that he had invested in Cadre based only on the merits of the business. “I just thought it was an attractive opportunity,” he said.","He said he knew Joshua Kushner and had met Jared Kushner once, at a conference in Aspen, Colorado, in autumn 2016. “He was very pleasant and nice, and it was sort of a cocktail-type conversation,” said Milner, adding that politics was not discussed.","Cadre operates from the Puck Building in the Nolita section of Manhattan. The Kushners’ father, Charles, bought the building in the 1980s before being jailed for a string of crimes including 18 counts of tax evasion.

But This One Is Different.","text":["Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has everything: peculiar billionaires, a once-adored startup turned monolith, a political mercenary who resembles a Bond villain and his shadowy psychographic profiling firm, an eccentric whistleblower, millions of profiles worth of leaked Facebook data, Steve Bannon, the Mercers, and — crucially — Donald Trump, and the results of the 2016 presidential election.","On its face, the incident read as confirmation of many people’s worst fears — that the online platforms we live on are manipulating us, using the personal information we provided in good faith without our knowledge. Add to it that one of those many unintended outcomes could have been Donald Trump’s election and you’ve got the makings of a lasting outrage.","While the main players in the scandal — Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Trump — will occupy headlines, they’re just the context — the perfect conditions for genuine outrage. But the Cambridge Analytica scandal isn’t really about Cambridge Analytica at all.","This is a data collection scandal. This is a scandal triggered by a specific incident, but that is broadly about the ways massive companies track us, harvest information from us, and then sell us as coercion targets in sophisticated information campaigns that could be for anything from diapers to mattresses to anti-vax literature.","The story will endure not because of animosity toward political data use but because it perfectly touches upon a deeper anxiety about our online privacy that’s been building for years. Indeed, the Cambridge Analytica scandal could well be the catalyst for a much bigger targeting revolt — a full-scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we’ve used the internet for the last decade. It’s a moment that forces us, collectively, to step back and think about what we sacrificed for a more convenient and connected world. And on an internet that feels increasingly toxic it’s hard to look at the tradeoffs we’ve made and feel like we’re getting a fair deal.","2. This is every place I have been in the last twelve months in Ireland, going in so far as the time of day I was in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT","You can see this reckoning already begin play out across the media as the focus shifts from Cambridge Analytica’s deeds to more general concerns about privacy and the degree to which our personal lives are catalogued so that we can be targeted by anyone with a dollar (or ruble) to spend online. Over the weekend, Ars Technica reported that Facebook has long requested access to contacts, SMS data, and call history on Android devices, hiding behind a confusing opt-in page as cover.","On Twitter, Facebook users are downloading their data and combing through it to highlight various abuses of trust: that the company kept a record of private phone calls and text message data or that Facebook shared personal information with outside entities for ad purposes. Download your own Facebook, Google, and YouTube data and you'll find years’ worth of personal information: every photo, comment, sticker emoji, video you've ever posted online; every location you’ve visited and IP address you’ve logged in from; every search, every file, and every single website you visited. It's binary confirmation of something we perhaps all have silently suppressed. Every movement you make online — and even where you move about in the world — is fastidiously catalogued, analyzed, and ultimately sold.","Ok @Google. I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway. See recent videos I watched! I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS? 😖😡🤬 https://t.co/NdJqEYfQIV","In the wake of this revolt, a 2010 clip of Steve Jobs talking about privacy has found new resonance in recent days. In an interview with journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, Jobs is asked to weigh in on a then-recent Facebook scandal and lays out his feelings on user privacy, as Mark Zuckerberg looks on in the audience. “Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly,” he says. “I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.”","Today, the clip is presented as a face-to-face warning from Jobs to Zuckerberg and as proof of sorts that Facebook knew exactly what sort of surveillance tools it was building. Indeed, Facebook’s history of privacy scandals makes the current revelations feel all the more flagrant.","In 2007, Zuckerberg first apologized for its controversial Beacon ad program, which tracked purchases on outside sites and posted that information onto a user’s News Feed. “Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. Three years later, in a sweat-filled interrogation at another D conference, Zuckerberg repeatedly dodged direct questions about Facebook’s cavalier attitudes toward privacy. More than 11 years after Beacon, Facebook is still behaving recklessly with our personal information and still making the same apologies — the only difference is that this time the advertising systems are far more complicated and the apologies come in full-page ads in the New York Times.","The Great Targeting Revolt isn’t just about the platforms; some in the ad industry are coming clean too. On Sunday the Verge published an editorial by a former digital marketer suggesting that Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the iceberg. “The contemporary Internet runs on the exploitation of user data,” the author wrote, before citing examples of corporations flagrantly flaunting user privacy to extract data. It may seem obvious but the revelation is profound and the language is important. Marketing is passive but targeting is active and invasive. A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted. Cambridge Analytica, the piece argues, isn’t an outlier but the blueprint for the internet’s vast online ad economy.","A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted.","Now in its second week, the size of the scandal is still unclear. We know that data obtained by a researcher was improperly shared with political consultants and that Cambridge Analytica did not delete the data upon Facebook’s request, but there’s a whole lot we don’t know for sure. Is this sort of improper data sharing an isolated incident or is this just part of a systemic information-control problem inside Facebook? Did the data get passed around to data brokers, states, or other companies besides SCL and Cambridge Analytica? Was the specific profile data used in any way to help target voters in the 2016 election? More importantly, is this data actually as useful in persuading voters as the targeting firms would have us believe? And are the people at Cambridge Analytica the psychographic targeting evil geniuses they claim to be? Or is it all just a bunch of bullshit — less “mindfuck tool” and more midlevel marketing?","There’s evidence to suggest that the Cambridge Analytica team were, at the very least, likely overselling their influence. “When we first saw the pitch the first thought was ‘Why would I pay all this money for this stuff when I could just get our guy from Facebook to do this kind of thing for us?’” a former senior Trump campaign official told BuzzFeed News. And some researchers and psychologists are dubious about the effectiveness of the Facebook data in political ad targeting. Speaking to Wired UK, one researcher argued that psychographic profiling is light on actual science. Another professor who studied voter behavior inside Facebook between 2010 and 2015 told the publication that the Facebook data gathered through questionnaires like Cambridge Analytica’s “may not measure what you really care about” and could have actually corrupted the ad targeting data the company had previously collected.","But none of that may matter much anymore at this point. The scandal feels like a watershed moment no matter how effective Cambridge Analytica may have been. Not only has the outrage endured more than a full week of news cycles, but it seems now as if in it the Big Tech backlash has reached a critical mass, sparking an unprecedented crisis. It’s caught the eye of lawmakers across the world — Zuckerberg has been summoned by Parliament in the UK and asked to testify in Congress by multiple senators; Facebook is now under an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission about its mishandling of Cambridge Analytica data; and across the world, company executives are getting skewered by governments in nations like the UK and, worse, Singapore, where officials suggest the company has lost their trust. It’s prompted more direct talk — even from Zuckerberg himself — of regulation. Anti-monopoly advocates are calling on the FTC to restructure Facebook, suggesting a spinoff of Facebook’s ad network and even the reversal of the company’s WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions to make them competing social networks. It even appears that inside Facebook itself there’s confusion and a sense of dwindling morale. And while the blowback isn’t enough to unseat Facebook in the App Store, regular, loyal Facebook users around the world have put momentum behind a #DeleteFacebook campaign — a novel act of online rebellion despite plenty of previous privacy scandals.","Some news events unexpectedly break through and take on new lives and trigger genuine, lasting movement. Moments like these are impossible to predict or control. The Parkland school shooting this February wasn’t an outlier in terms of casualties or sheer scale of horror and yet that particular tragedy’s aftermath was a breaking point and prompted a full-throated rejection of the status quo. The Parkland students were simply fed up. Fed up with the notion of not having control over their own safety. Fed up with a system in which victims of gun violence seemingly have no agency.","While the situations are drastically different, the frustration at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is similarly about agency and control. For years we’ve read about privacy scandals from the NSA’s Prism program to the data breaches everywhere from Equifax to Ashley Madison. We’re no stranger to the warnings that the platforms we live on harvest our data and that every detail of our online activities acts as the oil that powers the internet’s economic engine and that there’s little we can do, save for opting out completely. But this one lays bare the downsides of this tradeoff — how, despite their pledge to empower us, the platforms we live on have done just the opposite and stripped us of the agency to dictate what happens with our most personal information. Maybe it’s because Facebook feels so personal or because the 2016 election was so divisive, but this scandal is shaping up to be the event that forces the scales to fall from our eyes. We’ve lost control. And we’re fed up.","Every revolution needs to be ignited. Cambridge Analytica feels a lot like a spark.","If you want to read more about Facebook’s data scandal,subscribe to Infowarzel, a BuzzFeed News newsletter by the author of this piece, Charlie Warzel.","Charlie Warzel is a Senior Technology Writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in Missoula, Montana"],"isopubdate":""}

It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma.","A few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds.","Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window.","But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments.","When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality.","The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default.","“The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said.","“Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.”","To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work.","Quick Guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.","The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well.","The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable.","Aleksandr Kogan","To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters.","It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use.","And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred.","It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another.","The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database.","Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","See the full visual","The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed.","Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”.","Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach.","It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.” [...]","Actually tens of millions. From documents and a confirmation from Facebook, theObserver confirmed that the social media giant had by 2015 learned that the information had been harvested. But it didn’t let Facebook users know about this gigantic data breach and it didn’t do much to improve the security of 50 million people on its site.","Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated ourPlatform Policiesby passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","I hate to be all jaded and stuff, but protecting people’s information ought to at the heart of everything Facebook does. But, by focusing on the 270,000 people who consented and downplaying the extent of the breach by saying it only affected “friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it”—without mentioning that this is apparently 50 million people—Facebook executives failed once again to be transparent.","As for the uses those data reaped via Facebook were put, The New York Timesreported:","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’sacquisitionand use of Facebookdatahave surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting offa furious debateabout the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","In their note, which asked Grassley to convene a hearing, Klobuchar and Kennedy said the panel should invite Zuckerberg and also the top executives from Google and Twitter. Those companies also appeared in hearings in October and November.","Those previous hearings focused on Russian manipulation of social media platforms to potentially affect the 2016 presidential election, but lawmakers now are aiming to grill Facebook on an even more sensitive matter: how it handles the personal information of its 2.1 billion users.","“A hearing featuring testimony with CEOs would provide the Committee the opportunity to hear an update on the progress of these companies' voluntary measures to combat attempted foreign interference and what is being done to protect Americans’ data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections,” they added.","Grassley has not yet scheduled such a hearing, and a spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Facebook has denied any wrongdoing and has declined to comment on whether Zuckerberg would agree to appear on Capitol Hill.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” said Justin Osofsky, the vice president of global operations, in a statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Before changing its policies in 2014 and 2015, Facebook allowed developers of apps to gain detailed information on people who downloaded apps as well as their online “friends,” including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. Such information can be extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Cambridge Analytica gathered such information through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, which offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. The New York Times and the Observer of London have reported that allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends.”","Facebook banned the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two other people affiliated with the company Friday.

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the Federal Trade Commission on Monday to investigate Facebook. The FTC already penalized the company in 2011 for misleading consumers about its privacy practices. The consent decree settling the agency's investigation established several conditions, including that people whose data is shared with outside companies get notice and explicitly approve the sharing, according to former federal officials wrote drafted the consent decree. Facebook's sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica may have violated that settlement, triggering the possibility of many millions of dollars in fines, these former officials have said.","Blumenthal tweeted, “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise.”","The FTC did not immediately comment for this article. Facebook has said that it did not violated the 2011 consent decree.","Another Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), wrote Zuckerberg directly on Monday, asking whether there had been other examples in which third-party app developers collected or processed user data in violation of the site's rules. And he pressed the company to detail whether it had or would notify any of the 50 million whose personal information landed in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.","Wyden said the reports about Cambridge Analytica throw into question “not only the prudence and desirability of Facebook's business practices and the dangers of monetizing consumers' private information, but also [raise] serious concerns about the role Facebook played in facilitating and permitting the convert collection and misuse of consumer information.” He demanded answers by April 13.","A leading member of Parliament in Britain, meanwhile, has called on Zuckerberg and Cambridge Analytica to testify, as well.

Wylie’s allegations paint the company as ruthless in pursuit of data that would let it deliver on its promises.","CBS news reports that Facebook and Wylie have been in contact, with The Social Network™ saying “Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Cambridge Analytica has also taken to Twitter, as follows.","We refute these mischaracterizations and false allegations, and we are responding — watch our Twitter feed for more.","Another interesting one, given Cambridge Analytica’s assumed role in the Brexit vote. However both Tweets are also a little porous: the language used allows the possibility that Cambridge Analytica holds Facebook-derived data from sources other than profiles, or could have provided services to pro-Brexit organisations other than the Leave campaign.","The Register has sought comment from Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie and will update this story or write a new one if they offer any additional information. ®","Updated to add","Facebook's veep and deputy general counsel has been in touch with the following statement:","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it's a serious abuse of our rules. All parties involved — including the SCL Group/Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie and Aleksandr Kogan - certified to us that they destroyed the data in question. In light of new reports that the data was not destroyed, we are suspending these three parties from Facebook, pending further information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties.”","Bootnote","Another of Cambridge Analytica’s Tweets tried to paint its electioneering activities as anodyne.","Obama's 2008 campaign was famously data-driven, pioneered microtargeting in 2012, talking to people specifically based on the issues they care about. 6/8","As luck would have it, The Register encountered the Obama campaign’s chief technology officer, Harper Reed, in 2013. Here’s how we reported some of what he had to say.","“Data on what car you drive was not very useful in the campaign,” he said. “We did not use that much private data.” More useful, Reed said, was simple data points like a response to the question “do you support the President?” With a response to that question and information on whether an individual had voted in the past in hand, the Obama campaign was able to identify a voter as someone worthy of their attention.","We also wrote the following:","Reed also cautioned old people – anyone over 25 in his big-beard-chunky-earrings-and-thick-framed-glasses world – not to panic on the topic of privacy.

As we and others have reported, Cambridge Analytica ultimately partnered with the Donald Trump campaign to leverage the data of millions of Facebook users to target them with advertisements and campaign material. The original investigation into Cambridge Analytica, published on Motherboard in January 2017 and in German in Das Magazin in December 2016, follows below.","On November 9 at around 8.30 AM., Michal Kosinski woke up in the Hotel Sunnehus in Zurich. The 34-year-old researcher had come to give a lecture at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) about the dangers of Big Data and the digital revolution. Kosinski gives regular lectures on this topic all over the world. He is a leading expert in psychometrics, a data-driven sub-branch of psychology. When he turned on the TV that morning, he saw that the bombshell had exploded: contrary to forecasts by all leading statisticians, Donald J. Trump had been elected president of the United States.","For a long time, Kosinski watched the Trump victory celebrations and the results coming in from each state. He had a hunch that the outcome of the election might have something to do with his research. Finally, he took a deep breath and turned off the TV.","On the same day, a then little-known British company based in London sent out a press release: \"We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communication has played such an integral part in President-elect Trump's extraordinary win,\" Alexander James Ashburner Nix was quoted as saying. Nix is British, 41 years old, and CEO of Cambridge Analytica. He is always immaculately turned out in tailor-made suits and designer glasses, with his wavy blonde hair combed back from his forehead. His company wasn't just integral to Trump's online campaign, but to the UK's Brexit campaign as well.","Of these three players—reflective Kosinski, carefully groomed Nix and grinning Trump—one of them enabled the digital revolution, one of them executed it and one of them benefited from it.","How dangerous is big data?","Anyone who has not spent the last five years living on another planet will be familiar with the term Big Data. Big Data means, in essence, that everything we do, both on and offline, leaves digital traces. Every purchase we make with our cards, every search we type into Google, every movement we make when our mobile phone is in our pocket, every \"like\" is stored. Especially every \"like.\" For a long time, it was not entirely clear what use this data could have—except, perhaps, that we might find ads for high blood pressure remedies just after we've Googled \"reduce blood pressure.\"","On November 9, it became clear that maybe much more is possible. The company behind Trump's online campaign—the same company that had worked for Leave.EU in the very early stages of its \"Brexit\" campaign—was a Big Data company: Cambridge Analytica.","To understand the outcome of the election—and how political communication might work in the future—we need to begin with a strange incident at Cambridge University in 2014, at Kosinski's Psychometrics Center.","Psychometrics, sometimes also called psychographics, focuses on measuring psychological traits, such as personality. In the 1980s, two teams of psychologists developed a model that sought to assess human beings based on five personality traits, known as the \"Big Five.\" These are: openness (how open you are to new experiences?), conscientiousness (how much of a perfectionist are you?), extroversion (how sociable are you?), agreeableness (how considerate and cooperative you are?) and neuroticism (are you easily upset?). Based on these dimensions—they are also known as OCEAN, an acronym for openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism—we can make a relatively accurate assessment of the kind of person in front of us. This includes their needs and fears, and how they are likely to behave. The \"Big Five\" has become the standard technique of psychometrics. But for a long time, the problem with this approach was data collection, because it involved filling out a complicated, highly personal questionnaire. Then came the Internet. And Facebook. And Kosinski.","Michal Kosinski was a student in Warsaw when his life took a new direction in 2008. He was accepted by Cambridge University to do his PhD at the Psychometrics Centre, one of the oldest institutions of this kind worldwide. Kosinski joined fellow student David Stillwell (now a lecturer at Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge) about a year after Stillwell had launched a little Facebook application in the days when the platform had not yet become the behemoth it is today. Their MyPersonality app enabled users to fill out different psychometric questionnaires, including a handful of psychological questions from the Big Five personality questionnaire (\"I panic easily,\" \"I contradict others\"). Based on the evaluation, users received a \"personality profile\"—individual Big Five values—and could opt-in to share their Facebook profile data with the researchers.","Followers of Lady Gaga were most probably extroverts, while those who \"liked\" philosophy tended to be introverts.","Kosinski had expected a few dozen college friends to fill in the questionnaire, but before long, hundreds, thousands, then millions of people had revealed their innermost convictions. Suddenly, the two doctoral candidates owned the largest dataset combining psychometric scores with Facebook profiles ever to be collected.","The approach that Kosinski and his colleagues developed over the next few years was actually quite simple. First, they provided test subjects with a questionnaire in the form of an online quiz. From their responses, the psychologists calculated the personal Big Five values of respondents. Kosinski's team then compared the results with all sorts of other online data from the subjects: what they \"liked,\" shared or posted on Facebook, or what gender, age, place of residence they specified, for example. This enabled the researchers to connect the dots and make correlations.","Remarkably reliable deductions could be drawn from simple online actions. For example, men who \"liked\" the cosmetics brand MAC were slightly more likely to be gay; one of the best indicators for heterosexuality was \"liking\" Wu-Tang Clan. Followers of Lady Gaga were most probably extroverts, while those who \"liked\" philosophy tended to be introverts. While each piece of such information is too weak to produce a reliable prediction, when tens, hundreds, or thousands of individual data points are combined, the resulting predictions become really accurate.","Kosinski and his team tirelessly refined their models. In 2012, Kosinski proved that on the basis of an average of 68 Facebook \"likes\" by a user, it was possible to predict their skin color (with 95 percent accuracy), their sexual orientation (88 percent accuracy), and their affiliation to the Democratic or Republican party (85 percent). But it didn't stop there. Intelligence, religious affiliation, as well as alcohol, cigarette and drug use, could all be determined. From the data it was even possible to deduce whether someone's parents were divorced.","The strength of their modeling was illustrated by how well it could predict a subject's answers. Kosinski continued to work on the models incessantly: before long, he was able to evaluate a person better than the average work colleague, merely on the basis of ten Facebook \"likes.\" Seventy \"likes\" were enough to outdo what a person's friends knew, 150 what their parents knew, and 300 \"likes\" what their partner knew. More \"likes\" could even surpass what a person thought they knew about themselves. On the day that Kosinski published these findings, he received two phone calls. The threat of a lawsuit and a job offer. Both from Facebook.","Michal Kosinski. Courtesy of Kosinski","Only weeks later Facebook \"likes\" became private by default. Before that, the default setting was that anyone on the internet could see your \"likes.\" But this was no obstacle to data collectors: while Kosinski always asked for the consent of Facebook users, many apps and online quizzes today require access to private data as a precondition for taking personality tests. (Anybody who wants to evaluate themselves based on their Facebook \"likes\" can do so on Kosinski's website, and then compare their results to those of a classic Ocean questionnaire, like that of the Cambridge Psychometrics Center.)","Our smartphone, Kosinski concluded, is a vast psychological questionnaire that we are constantly filling out, both consciously and unconsciously.","But it was not just about \"likes\" or even Facebook: Kosinski and his team could now ascribe Big Five values based purely on how many profile pictures a person has on Facebook, or how many contacts they have (a good indicator of extraversion). But we also reveal something about ourselves even when we're not online. For example, the motion sensor on our phone reveals how quickly we move and how far we travel (this correlates with emotional instability). Our smartphone, Kosinski concluded, is a vast psychological questionnaire that we are constantly filling out, both consciously and unconsciously.","Above all, however—and this is key—it also works in reverse: not only can psychological profiles be created from your data, but your data can also be used the other way round to search for specific profiles: all anxious fathers, all angry introverts, for example—or maybe even all undecided Democrats? Essentially, what Kosinski had invented was sort of a people search engine. He started to recognize the potential—but also the inherent danger—of his work.","To him, the internet had always seemed like a gift from heaven. What he really wanted was to give something back, to share. Data can be copied, so why shouldn't everyone benefit from it? It was the spirit of a whole generation, the beginning of a new era that transcended the limitations of the physical world. But what would happen, wondered Kosinski, if someone abused his people search engine to manipulate people? He began to add warnings to most of his scientific work. His approach, he warned, \"could pose a threat to an individual's well-being, freedom, or even life.\" But no one seemed to grasp what he meant.","Around this time, in early 2014, Kosinski was approached by a young assistant professor in the psychology department called Aleksandr Kogan. He said he was inquiring on behalf of a company that was interested in Kosinski's method, and wanted to access the MyPersonality database. Kogan wasn't at liberty to reveal for what purpose; he was bound to secrecy.","At first, Kosinski and his team considered this offer, as it would mean a great deal of money for the institute, but then he hesitated. Finally, Kosinski remembers, Kogan revealed the name of the company: SCL, or Strategic Communication Laboratories. Kosinski Googled the company: \"[We are] the premier election management agency,\" says the company's website. SCL provides marketing based on psychological modeling. One of its core focuses: Influencing elections. Influencing elections? Perturbed, Kosinski clicked through the pages. What kind of company was this? And what were these people planning?","What Kosinski did not know at the time: SCL is the parent of a group of companies. Who exactly owns SCL and its diverse branches is unclear, thanks to a convoluted corporate structure, the type seen in the UK Companies House, the Panama Papers, and the Delaware company registry. Some of the SCL offshoots have been involved in elections from Ukraine to Nigeria, helped the Nepalese monarch against the rebels, whereas others have developed methods to influence Eastern European and Afghan citizens for NATO. And, in 2013, SCL spun off a new company to participate in US elections: Cambridge Analytica.","Kosinski knew nothing about all this, but he had a bad feeling. \"The whole thing started to stink,\" he recalls. On further investigation, he discovered that Aleksandr Kogan had secretly registered a company doing business with SCL. According to a December 2015 report in The Guardian and to internal company documents given to Das Magazin, it emerges that SCL learned about Kosinski's method from Kogan.","Kosinski came to suspect that Kogan's company might have reproduced the Facebook \"Likes\"-based Big Five measurement tool in order to sell it to this election-influencing firm. He immediately broke off contact with Kogan and informed the director of the institute, sparking a complicated conflict within the university. The institute was worried about its reputation. Aleksandr Kogan then moved to Singapore, married, and changed his name to Dr. Spectre. Michal Kosinski finished his PhD, got a job offer from Stanford and moved to the US.","Mr. Brexit","All was quiet for about a year. Then, in November 2015, the more radical of the two Brexit campaigns, \"Leave.EU,\" supported by Nigel Farage, announced that it had commissioned a Big Data company to support its online campaign: Cambridge Analytica. The company's core strength: innovative political marketing—microtargeting—by measuring people's personality from their digital footprints, based on the OCEAN model.","After the Brexit result, friends and acquaintances wrote to him: Just look at what you've done.","Now Kosinski received emails asking what he had to do with it—the words Cambridge, personality, and analytics immediately made many people think of Kosinski. It was the first time he had heard of the company, which borrowed its name, it said, from its first employees, researchers from the university. Horrified, he looked at the website. Was his methodology being used on a grand scale for political purposes?","After the Brexit result, friends and acquaintances wrote to him: Just look at what you've done. Everywhere he went, Kosinski had to explain that he had nothing to do with this company. (It remains unclear how deeply Cambridge Analytica was involved in the Brexit campaign. Cambridge Analytica would not discuss such questions.)","For a few months, things are relatively quiet. Then, on September 19, 2016, just over a month before the US elections, the guitar riffs of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Bad Moon Rising\" fill the dark-blue hall of New York's Grand Hyatt hotel. The Concordia Summit is a kind of World Economic Forum in miniature. Decision-makers from all over the world have been invited, among them Swiss President Johann Schneider-Ammann. \"Please welcome to the stage Alexander Nix, chief executive officer of Cambridge Analytica,\" a smooth female voice announces. A slim man in a dark suit walks onto the stage. A hush falls. Many in attendance know that this is Trump's new digital strategy man. (A video of the presentation was posted on YouTube.)","A few weeks earlier, Trump had tweeted, somewhat cryptically, \"Soon you'll be calling me Mr. Brexit.\" Political observers had indeed noticed some striking similarities between Trump's agenda and that of the right-wing Brexit movement. But few had noticed the connection with Trump's recent hiring of a marketing company named Cambridge Analytica.","Alexander Nix. Image: Cambridge Analytica","\"Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,\" says Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix","Up to this point, Trump's digital campaign had consisted of more or less one person: Brad Parscale, a marketing entrepreneur and failed start-up founder who created a rudimentary website for Trump for $1,500. The 70-year-old Trump is not digitally savvy—there isn't even a computer on his office desk. Trump doesn't do emails, his personal assistant once revealed. She herself talked him into having a smartphone, from which he now tweets incessantly.","Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, relied heavily on the legacy of the first \"social-media president,\" Barack Obama. She had the address lists of the Democratic Party, worked with cutting-edge big data analysts from BlueLabs and received support from Google and DreamWorks. When it was announced in June 2016 that Trump had hired Cambridge Analytica, the establishment in Washington just turned up their noses. Foreign dudes in tailor-made suits who don't understand the country and its people? Seriously?","\"It is my privilege to speak to you today about the power of Big Data and psychographics in the electoral process.\" The logo of Cambridge Analytica— a brain composed of network nodes, like a map, appears behind Alexander Nix. \"Only 18 months ago, Senator Cruz was one of the less popular candidates,\" explains the blonde man in a cut-glass British accent, which puts Americans on edge the same way that a standard German accent can unsettle Swiss people. \"Less than 40 percent of the population had heard of him,\" another slide says. Cambridge Analytica had become involved in the US election campaign almost two years earlier, initially as a consultant for Republicans Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. Cruz—and later Trump—was funded primarily by the secretive US software billionaire Robert Mercer who, along with his daughter Rebekah, is reported to be the largest investor in Cambridge Analytica.","\"So how did he do this?\" Up to now, explains Nix, election campaigns have been organized based on demographic concepts. \"A really ridiculous idea. The idea that all women should receive the same message because of their gender—or all African Americans because of their race.\" What Nix meant is that while other campaigners so far have relied on demographics, Cambridge Analytica was using psychometrics.","Though this might be true, Cambridge Analytica's role within Cruz's campaign isn't undisputed. In December 2015 the Cruz team credited their rising success to psychological use of data and analytics. In Advertising Age, a political client said the embedded Cambridge staff was \"like an extra wheel,\" but found their core product, Cambridge's voter data modeling, still \"excellent.\" The campaign would pay the company at least $5.8 million to help identify voters in the Iowa caucuses, which Cruz won, before dropping out of the race in May.","Nix clicks to the next slide: five different faces, each face corresponding to a personality profile. It is the Big Five or OCEAN Model. \"At Cambridge,\" he said, \"we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.\" The hall is captivated. According to Nix, the success of Cambridge Analytica's marketing is based on a combination of three elements: behavioral science using the OCEAN Model, Big Data analysis, and ad targeting. Ad targeting is personalized advertising, aligned as accurately as possible to the personality of an individual consumer.","Nix candidly explains how his company does this. First, Cambridge Analytica buys personal data from a range of different sources, like land registries, automotive data, shopping data, bonus cards, club memberships, what magazines you read, what churches you attend. Nix displays the logos of globally active data brokers like Acxiom and Experian—in the US, almost all personal data is for sale. For example, if you want to know where Jewish women live, you can simply buy this information, phone numbers included. Now Cambridge Analytica aggregates this data with the electoral rolls of the Republican party and online data and calculates a Big Five personality profile. Digital footprints suddenly become real people with fears, needs, interests, and residential addresses.","The methodology looks quite similar to the one that Michal Kosinski once developed. Cambridge Analytica also uses, Nix told us, \"surveys on social media\" and Facebook data. And the company does exactly what Kosinski warned of: \"We have profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America—220 million people,\" Nix boasts.","He opens the screenshot. \"This is a data dashboard that we prepared for the Cruz campaign.\" A digital control center appears. On the left are diagrams; on the right, a map of Iowa, where Cruz won a surprisingly large number of votes in the primary. And on the map, there are hundreds of thousands of small red and blue dots. Nix narrows down the criteria: \"Republicans\"—the blue dots disappear; \"not yet convinced\"—more dots disappear; \"male\", and so on. Finally, only one name remains, including age, address, interests, personality and political inclination. How does Cambridge Analytica now target this person with an appropriate political message?","Alexander Nix at the 2016 Concordia Summit in New York. Image: Concordia Summit","Nix shows how psychographically categorized voters can be differently addressed, based on the example of gun rights, the 2nd Amendment: \"For a highly neurotic and conscientious audience the threat of a burglary—and the insurance policy of a gun.\" An image on the left shows the hand of an intruder smashing a window. The right side shows a man and a child standing in a field at sunset, both holding guns, clearly shooting ducks: \"Conversely, for a closed and agreeable audience. People who care about tradition, and habits, and family.\"","How to keep Clinton voters away from the ballot box","Trump's striking inconsistencies, his much-criticized fickleness, and the resulting array of contradictory messages, suddenly turned out to be his great asset: a different message for every voter. The notion that Trump acted like a perfectly opportunistic algorithm following audience reactions is something the mathematician Cathy O'Neil observed in August 2016.","These \"dark posts\"—sponsored Facebook posts that can only be seen by users with specific profiles—included videos aimed at African-Americans in which Hillary Clinton refers to black men as predators, for example.","\"Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,\" Alexander Nix remembers. On the day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, Trump's team tested 175,000 different ad variations for his arguments, in order to find the right versions above all via Facebook. The messages differed for the most part only in microscopic details, in order to target the recipients in the optimal psychological way: different headings, colors, captions, with a photo or video. This fine-tuning reaches all the way down to the smallest groups, Nix explained in an interview with us. \"We can address villages or apartment blocks in a targeted way. Even individuals.\"","In the Miami district of Little Haiti, for instance, Trump's campaign provided inhabitants with news about the failure of the Clinton Foundation following the earthquake in Haiti, in order to keep them from voting for Hillary Clinton. This was one of the goals: to keep potential Clinton voters (which include wavering left-wingers, African-Americans, and young women) away from the ballot box, to \"suppress\" their vote, as one senior campaign official told Bloomberg in the weeks before the election. These \"dark posts\"—sponsored news-feed-style ads in Facebook timelines that can only be seen by users with specific profiles—included videos aimed at African-Americans in which Hillary Clinton refers to black men as predators, for example.","Nix finishes his lecture at the Concordia Summit by stating that traditional blanket advertising is dead. \"My children will certainly never, ever understand this concept of mass communication.\" And before leaving the stage, he announced that since Cruz had left the race, the company was helping one of the remaining presidential candidates.","Just how precisely the American population was being targeted by Trump's digital troops at that moment was not visible, because they attacked less on mainstream TV and more with personalized messages on social media or digital TV. And while the Clinton team thought it was in the lead, based on demographic projections, Bloomberg journalist Sasha Issenberg was surprised to note on a visit to San Antonio—where Trump's digital campaign was based—that a \"second headquarters\" was being created. The embedded Cambridge Analytica team, apparently only a dozen people, received $100,000 from Trump in July, $250,000 in August, and $5 million in September. According to Nix, the company earned over $15 million overall. (The company is incorporated in the US, where laws regarding the release of personal data are more lax than in European Union countries. Whereas European privacy laws require a person to \"opt in\" to a release of data, those in the US permit data to be released unless a user \"opts out.\")","Groundgame, an app for election canvassing that integrates voter data with \"geospatial visualization technology,\" was used by campaigners for Trump and Brexit. Image: L2","The measures were radical: From July 2016, Trump's canvassers were provided with an app with which they could identify the political views and personality types of the inhabitants of a house. It was the same app provider used by Brexit campaigners. Trump's people only rang at the doors of houses that the app rated as receptive to his messages. The canvassers came prepared with guidelines for conversations tailored to the personality type of the resident. In turn, the canvassers fed the reactions into the app, and the new data flowed back to the dashboards of the Trump campaign.","Again, this is nothing new. The Democrats did similar things, but there is no evidence that they relied on psychometric profiling. Cambridge Analytica, however, divided the US population into 32 personality types, and focused on just 17 states. And just as Kosinski had established that men who like MAC cosmetics are slightly more likely to be gay, the company discovered that a preference for cars made in the US was a great indication of a potential Trump voter. Among other things, these findings now showed Trump which messages worked best and where. The decision to focus on Michigan and Wisconsin in the final weeks of the campaign was made on the basis of data analysis. The candidate became the instrument for implementing a big data model.","What's Next?","But to what extent did psychometric methods influence the outcome of the election? When asked, Cambridge Analytica was unwilling to provide any proof of the effectiveness of its campaign. And it is quite possible that the question is impossible to answer.","And yet there are clues: There is the fact of the surprising rise of Ted Cruz during the primaries. Also there was an increased number of voters in rural areas. There was the decline in the number of African-American early votes. The fact that Trump spent so little money may also be explained by the effectiveness of personality-based advertising. As does the fact that he invested far more in digital than TV campaigning compared to Hillary Clinton. Facebook proved to be the ultimate weapon and the best election campaigner, as Nix explained, and as comments by several core Trump campaigners demonstrate.","Cambridge Analytica counts among its clients the U.S. State Department, and has been reported to have communicated with British Prime Minister Theresa May, pictured here with Secretary of State John Kerry on July 19, 2016. Image: U.S. Dept. of State","Many voices have claimed that the statisticians lost the election because their predictions were so off the mark. But what if statisticians in fact helped win the election—but only those who were using the new method? It is an irony of history that Trump, who often grumbled about scientific research, used a highly scientific approach in his campaign.","Another big winner is Cambridge Analytica. Its board member Steve Bannon, former executive chair of the right-wing online newspaper Breitbart News, has been appointed as Donald Trump's senior counselor and chief strategist. Whilst Cambridge Analytica is not willing to comment on alleged ongoing talks with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Alexander Nix claims that he is building up his client base worldwide, and that he has received inquiries from Switzerland, Germany, and Australia. His company is currently touring European conferences showcasing their success in the United States. This year three core countries of the EU are facing elections with resurgent populist parties: France, Holland and Germany. The electoral successes come at an opportune time, as the company is readying for a push into commercial advertising.","Kosinski has observed all of this from his office at Stanford. Following the US election, the university is in turmoil. Kosinski is responding to developments with the sharpest weapon available to a researcher: a scientific analysis. Together with his research colleague Sandra Matz, he has conducted a series of tests, which will soon be published. The initial results are alarming: The study shows the effectiveness of personality targeting by showing that marketers can attract up to 63 percent more clicks and up to 1,400 more conversions in real-life advertising campaigns on Facebook when matching products and marketing messages to consumers' personality characteristics. They further demonstrate the scalability of personality targeting by showing that the majority of Facebook Pages promoting products or brands are affected by personality and that large numbers of consumers can be accurately targeted based on a single Facebook Page.","In a statement after the German publication of this article, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said, \"Cambridge Analytica does not use data from Facebook. It has had no dealings with Dr. Michal Kosinski. It does not subcontract research. It does not use the same methodology. Psychographics was hardly used at all. Cambridge Analytica did not engage in efforts to discourage any Americans from casting their vote in the presidential election. Its efforts were solely directed towards increasing the number of voters in the election.\"","The world has been turned upside down. Great Britain is leaving the EU, Donald Trump is president of the United States of America. And in Stanford, Kosinski, who wanted to warn against the danger of using psychological targeting in a political setting, is once again receiving accusatory emails. \"No,\" says Kosinski, quietly and shaking his head. \"This is not my fault. I did not build the bomb. I only showed that it exists.\""],"isopubdate":"2017-01-28"}

(Thomas Peter/Reuters)","By John Pomfret","March 27","When a woman walked to work this month in the bustling Southern Chinese metropolis of Shenzhen, she, like many millions of other Chinese, jaywalked, cutting across a side street to avoid a detour of hundreds of yards to a crosswalk. What happened next, as documented by the woman, a writer calling herself Mao Yan, was an illustration of a brave new world being born in China.","Two traffic policemen approached the woman and told her that she had violated the traffic regulations of the People’s Republic of China. Eager to get to her job, Mao Yan apologized and pointed out that there was no fencing to block jaywalkers like her. She hoped to get off with a verbal warning. The officers, however, were intent on prosecution. They demanded her identity card, which is issued to all Chinese citizens. When Mao Yan said that she had not brought hers, they asked for her ID number. When she said she had not memorized it, one officer snapped her picture with a camera phone. Seconds later he read out her name, her ID card number and date of birth. Using facial recognition technology, he had identified Mao Yan.","Then Mao Yan heard the clatter of a printer from a nearby police kiosk. One of the officers entered the kiosk and returned with a slip. “It was my first ever traffic citation,” Mao Yan wrote. On the citation was a QR code that she scanned to pay her fine via a messaging app called WeChat that is managed by Tencent, a private Chinese company.","Mao Yan was taken aback by the experience and what she called “the stunning efficiency of the facial recognition technology possessed by our traffic police.” She shared her story with friends, who told her she was lucky that she had not crossed against a light. If she had, police could have put her face, her full name and several digits of her ID card number on a public bulletin board for everyone to see. “Jaywalkers have fewer rights than criminal suspects,” she wrote, pointing out that in Chinese news reports, suspects are often not fully identified and their faces are blotted out.","Mao Yan’s Shenzhen is part of one of the great social experiments of mankind — the use of massive amounts of data, combined with facial recognition technology, shaming and artificial intelligence to control a population via marriage of the state and private companies. Already on the packed highways of Shanghai, honking has decreased. That’s because directional microphones coupled with high-definition cameras can identify and ticket — again, via WeChat — noisy drivers and display their names, photographs and identity card numbers on the city’s many LED boards. On some streets, if drivers stop their cars by the side of the road longer than seven minutes, high-definition cameras identify the driver and, again, issue him or her an instant ticket.","In other parts of China the technology is being used by the state security apparatus to crack down on separatism. In Xinjiang, which has been the site of a separatist movement against Chinese rule, China’s police have established a 21st-century police state through an infrastructure of security technology with high-definition cameras, facial-recognition technology, iris and body scanners at checkpoints, the forced collection of DNA, and the mandatory use of apps that monitor messages on smartphones. The focus of this campaign is the Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group that is mostly Muslim.","But as Mao Yan’s story makes clear, this technology is bleeding into the rest of China, where 95 percent of the population is Han Chinese. And China’s authorities won’t be content with traffic stops. Their goal is behavioral modification on a massive scale. Chinese planners have announced their intention to tap the vast AI and surveillance infrastructure currently under construction to generate “social credit” scores for all of China’s 1.5 billion people. With a high score, traveling, securing a loan, buying a car and other benefits will be easy to come by. Run afoul of the authorities, and problems begin.","Some Chinese businessmen who are benefiting from this massive investment in data have argued that the Chinese are less concerned about privacy than people in the United States. Robin Li, the founder of Baidu, China’s version of Google, which routinely shares its data with the Chinese Communist Party, argued over the weekend that Chinese people don’t care that much about privacy. “The Chinese people are more open or less sensitive about the privacy issue,” said Li, speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing. “If they are able to trade privacy for convenience, safety and efficiency, in a lot of cases, they are willing to do that.” Ironically, Li’s remarks were released by the Chinese magazine Caixin on the same day that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for releasing user data to a political consultancy.","In her article, Mao Yan didn’t seem to agree with Li’s optimistic interpretation of the campaign. “Maybe,” she wrote, “it’s intimidation to make everyone afraid.” I think she’s right. Hours after Mao Yan posted her story on China’s Internet, censors took it down.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","John PomfretJohn Pomfret, a former Washington Post bureau chief in Beijing, is the author of “The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom: America and China, 1776 to the Present.” Follow"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand.","Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network.","He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them.","“Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it.","“Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.”","Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland.","(NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.)","The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges.","The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results).","And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value — and led to a bunch of lawsuits.","“We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on.","“Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.”","He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account.","So, er, ouch.","In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner himself as, er, hostile to privacy…","A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement:","We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further.","This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions.","Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!).","The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning.","Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook.","Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period.","Downloaded FB data also gives you insight into whom else has data on you (used to run custom audiences). Have never engaged with 75% of these… pic.twitter.com/dQPjIcI8CW","“I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.”","Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot.","But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users.","“They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.”","“Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large.","“It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?”","“They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks. If you think about how antitrust laws work, that’s the starting point for those laws. So it’s kind of mindboggling that they don’t see their argumentation, how it’s going to hurt them at some point.”","About RN","Rocketnews is an aggregator of the top online news articles and stories from around the globe.

{"originalurl":"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-rebekah-mercer-227799","title":"Inside the Trump campaign: The most powerful woman in GOP politics - POLITICO","text":["A New York hedge fund heiress who co-owns a boutique cookie bakery has emerged as one of the most influential figures behind Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and arguably the conservative movement as a whole.","Leaning on the fortune amassed by her father, Rebekah Mercer has steered her family’s rapid rise over the course of just a few years from the conservative fringe to the white-hot center of the most dramatic election season in years. And no matter the results on Nov. 8, the Mercers are positioned to reshape the American right for years to come in their anti-establishment image.","Story Continued Below","But the family’s rise, facilitated by an increasingly aggressive network of Mercer-backed institutions and operatives, has prompted worry within the GOP about an attempted takeover, and questions from across the political spectrum about what the Mercers intend to do with the influence they’ve purchased.","Efforts to deduce the family’s intentions have focused largely on the family patriarch, Robert Mercer, 70, a pioneer in quantitative trading. But Bob Mercer, as he’s known, is mostly only writing multimillion-dollar checks that fund the family’s political operation; it is his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, 42, who is running the operation, according to more than 15 personal and political associates of the family.","It is Rebekah Mercer, according to these sources, whose frustration with what she saw as the political ineffectiveness of the Koch brothers’ network led her to redirect Mercer money to build a rival operation.","It is Rebekah Mercer who directs a family foundation that, according to tax returns, has more than doubled its giving between 2011 and 2014, donating $34.6 million to 30 conservative nonprofits over which she holds varying degrees of sway — from the Government Accountability Institute, which produced \"Clinton Cash,\" a book that damaged Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, to the venerable Heritage Foundation, where she sits on the board.","It is the same Rebekah Mercer who urges campaigns and clients who want her father’s funding to hire a data firm owned largely by the family called Cambridge Analytica, which now counts Trump’s campaign among its clients.","And it is Rebekah Mercer whose meeting with Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, reportedly set the stage for the Mercers to switch their support to Donald Trump after the family’s first choice, Ted Cruz, dropped out of the race, rather than retreating to the sidelines as so many other big donors did.","Rebekah Mercer now sits at the nexus of Trump’s universe. So influential has she become that her conversation with Trump during an August fundraiser in the Hamptons has been widely credited with spurring the rookie candidate to shake up his campaign team by turning its leadership over to two of her closest confidants.","Pollster Kellyanne Conway, who has worked with Mercer on a pro-Cruz super PAC, became campaign manager, while the new job of campaign CEO went to Steve Bannon, a campaign novice who helped run both the Government Accountability Institute — which has received at least $2 million from the Mercer foundation — and Breitbart News, the intensely pro-Trump nationalist website in which the Mercers have invested. This month, Trump rounded out his newly reconfigured campaign leadership by bringing in yet another operative with whom Mercer has worked — David Bossie, who previously ran both an anti-Clinton super PAC that received $2 million from Bob Mercer in July and an anti-Clinton nonprofit called Citizens United that received $3.6 million from the Mercers’ foundation from 2012 through 2014.","Rebekah Mercer did not respond to requests for comment. Conway, Bannon and Bossie either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. And most conservative insiders approached for this story were loath to speak on the record for fear it might jeopardize their chances of receiving funding from Mercer's intensely private family. Mercer, some said, has scolded allies for calling attention to her — even when it’s been positive.","But granted anonymity, the professional and personal associates offer one overarching explanation for the Mercers’ otherwise eclectic series of political moves: Bob and Rebekah Mercer harbor a deep and abiding enmity toward the political establishment.","That context helps account for a surge in political investments that might otherwise come across as quixotic, wasteful or ideologically inconsistent. It explains their shift from Cruz (a socially conservative constitutionalist with a hawkish streak who benefited from $13.5 million from Mercer super PAC spending) to Trump (whose commitment to social and national security conservatism is uncertain but who has nonetheless benefited from $2 million from Bob Mercer and counting), as well as their support for failed long-shot congressional candidates such as Kelli Ward and Arthur Robinson.","“They see the establishment as a very real threat to freedom in America, and they see the need to defeat it,” said Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center.","An operative who has worked with the Mercers said their enmity is especially pronounced toward the GOP establishment. “They want to blow things up and start from scratch,” said the operative, pointing to Breitbart News’ fawning coverage of the unsuccessful long-shot challenger to House Speaker Paul Ryan in last month’s GOP primary in Wisconsin.","In all, a POLITICO analysis found that the Mercers have made $73.5 million in disclosed politically oriented donations since the Supreme Court’s January 2010 Citizens United decision paved the way for unlimited political spending through super PACs and other nonprofits. Of that, $39 million came in donations to political candidates and committees from members of the family, and $34.6 million came from the family foundation to conservative nonprofits.","That tally doesn’t come close to approaching the combined spending of the Koch network, which expects to spend $750 million in the run-up to the 2016 election. But the Mercers’ spending does put them in league with donors like fellow New York hedge fund tycoon Paul Singer and members of the Ricketts family, who have become gravitational centers in conservative politics. And that’s even before considering the Mercers’ investments in Breitbart News and Cambridge Analytica, for-profit companies that don’t disclose investors but that could have a greater long-term impact on conservative politics than any given campaign or nonprofit group.","A conservative who travels in the same social circle as Rebekah Mercer described her motivations thusly: “This is about political power. This is about who controls the data and the narrative, and who ultimately is going to end up calling the shots.”","But Bozell, a longtime fixture of the GOP’s right flank who is widely seen as having been among the first to cultivate the Mercers as political donors about a decade ago, said he would advise them against trying to take over the conservative movement.","“They have become great sources of support, obviously, for the conservative movement,” said Bozell, whose Media Research Center has received more than $10 million from the Mercers' foundation and included Rebekah Mercer on its board until at least 2014, according to tax documents filed by the MRC and the Mercers' foundation. “But control? No.”","Bozell declined to discuss the family’s plans or Rebekah Mercer’s role in its political activism.","“I do know that she is brilliant,” he said. “She is thoughtful and she has got a keen analytical mind, which came right from her father, and my guess is that her father is very comfortable with her involvement, whatever that may be.”","***Rebekah Mercer, who is known to friends as “Bekah,” is the middle of three daughters born to Bob and Diana Mercer and raised in suburban Westchester County, New York.","Described almost universally as intelligent and hard-working, Mercer graduated from Stanford in 1996 with a dual degree in biology and mathematics, then received a master’s in operations research from Stanford. She went to work on Wall Street as a trader, before retiring to raise the four children she had with her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff, a managing director at Morgan Stanley.","Associates describe the family as close-knit and culturally conservative but also known to spend lavishly on their wide-ranging hobbies.","In 2006, Bekah Mercer and her sisters bought and took over the popular bakery Ruby et Violette in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of midtown Manhattan. The bakery later shuttered its storefront and now sells exclusively from a website that invites customers to “seduce someone” with its sweets. Bekah Mercer still features her ownership and management of the company prominently in her bios on the websites of the various Mercer-backed nonprofit groups on whose boards she sits.","While the three Mercer sisters worked together on the bakery, they had different interests outside of it.","The youngest daughter, Heather Sue Mercer, is a competitive poker player, like her father. Conservative operatives buzz about the family’s annual holiday parties at their Long Island estate, which feature blackjack and poker tables. The Mercers supply chips — free of charge — that can be redeemed at the end of the night for lavish prizes such as gold Rolexes, according to people who have attended.","The oldest daughter, Jennifer, or \"Jenji,\" Mercer shares her mother’s interest in horses. Bob Mercer built a lavish riding center in Florida and invested in a Colorado horse park and an international equestrian center in North Carolina featuring five arenas and 500 stables.","Bekah Mercer, associates say, is the member of the family who most shares Bob Mercer’s passion for politics.","Bob Mercer “supports each of his daughters' efforts in their own individual areas of interest,” said a Republican strategist who has spent time with the family.","While Bob Mercer is known as quiet and difficult to engage, he “lights up when he’s with Rebekah and just becomes really alive,” said a donor who has spent time with the pair at political events.","The pair shifted their political engagement into high gear in 2010 after a few years of being significant — but not elite — players in conservative finance circles. That was the year that Bob Mercer became co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world’s most successful hedge funds.","The 2010 election cycle was the first after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision created a Wild West campaign-finance landscape. And Bob Mercer jumped right in, pouring $640,000 into a super PAC — one of the first — that funded attacks against Oregon Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio, who had sponsored legislation that would have raised taxes on hedge funds. DeFazio nonetheless handily defeated his Republican challenger, Arthur Robinson, whose Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, which stockpiles human urine for medical research and attacks the scientific consensus on climate change, has been the recipient of Mercer funding. (Robinson’s unsuccessful 2012 and 2014 challenges to DeFazio were also boosted by Mercer-funded attacks on DeFazio.)","In 2010, Bekah Mercer also joined the board of the Media Research Center, and, under her direction, the family’s foundation began escalating its grant writing. In 2011, it increased its donations to $7 million. Within three years, that figure was $18 million.","In 2011, Bob Mercer reportedly invested $10 million in Breitbart, and around 2013, as first reported by POLITICO, the family became the largest investor in Cambridge Analytica, the American spinoff of the British data analysis firm Strategic Communications Laboratories Group, or SCL. Bannon played a role in brokering that deal, according to two operatives familiar with it, and the company’s officials, with help from Bekah Mercer, began presenting Cambridge Analytica’s product as superior to both a Koch-backed data firm and that of an RNC-blessed data outfit.","It was around 2011 that the Mercers joined the network of donors spearheaded by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, according to four operatives familiar with the family’s involvement in the network.","These sources said Bob and Bekah Mercer started attending the twice-a-year donor summits, convened by the Koch brothers, at which the brothers raised tens of millions of dollars for a Koch-controlled political and public policy network. Comprised of advocacy groups that don’t disclose their donors, as well as i360 and a super PAC called Freedom Partners Action Fund, the Koch network has in some ways, in terms of influence, rivaled the RNC. The Mercers began giving at least $1 million a year — and much more in some years — to the network, according to the operatives familiar with the family’s involvement.","At a summit in 2013 or 2014,Koch operatives bought a shipment of cookies from Ruby et Violette as welcome presents, which were left in donors’ rooms with notes thanking Bekah Mercer, according to two of the operatives familiar with the family’s involvement in the network. The move was seen a deft bit of donor maintenance intended to build good will with the Mercers, who, as the Koch operatives were aware, were branching out on their own even as they kept a foot in Koch world.","But by the beginning of the 2014 cycle, Bob Mercer was signaling that his middle daughter was taking charge of the family’s political portfolio, according to operatives who work with the family. They said it had become clear that Bekah Mercer strongly preferred investing in campaigns and causes over which she could exert control.","Bekah Mercer had grown increasingly frustrated with the Kochs’ approach. It is not as politically aggressive as she preferred and also much more supportive of trade and immigration, said operatives and donors familiar with the Mercers’ involvement with the Kochs. They said Bekah Mercer also questioned the effectiveness of the spending orchestrated by the Kochs’ operatives and bristled at what she perceived as their unwillingness to heed her advice.","Bekah and Bob Mercer stopped attending the Koch donor summits and dialed back their giving to the network, according to the operatives familiar with the family’s involvement in the network.","“Some people believe only they can achieve whatever goal it is, and I think she is in that camp,” said one Koch network donor who worked with Bekah Mercer. “And she wasn't totally aligned with us. She's much more populist.”","According to a Republican who advises her, Bekah Mercer has grown wary working with other political activists and operatives, in general. “She’s a very serious person. Very smart. Very dedicated to what she’s doing, and I think she feels that a lot of these people are taking advantage of her,” said the adviser. “She wants to have an impact, and she hasn’t found people she can trust.”","Indeed, while Bob Mercer finished 2014 as the sixth biggest donor of the cycle, with $8.4 million in disclosed donations, perhaps more significantly, by the end of the cycle, the Mercers were perceived within conservative politics as their own center of gravity, unmoored from — and in competition with — other major donors-backed networks and even the RNC, which Breitbart railed against.","***Heading into the spring of 2015, Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign appeared to be the perfect proving ground for the Mercers' fully operational political machine.","The Mercers had grown enamored with the Texan after meeting him at a gathering of the fiscal conservative outfit Club for Growth, to which Bob and Bekah Mercer have donated $2.3 million over the years.","For Bekah Mercer, even the Club, a leading supporter of many fiery Republican insurgents, sometimes proved too cozy with the establishment. After Joe Scarborough spoke at the group's annual donor retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, in early 2013, Mercer stood up and confronted the MSNBC host, who had recently called Cruz a \"carnival barker\" on air. She told Scarborough she did not know who had invited him and pointed out that the Club was a big backer of the Texas senator, according to a person who was present. Scarborough did not respond to a request for comment.","But things started getting testy almost immediately. At the fundraiser, Bekah Mercer fumed about campaign manager Jeff Roe, who had chewed out Cambridge’s technicians for missing deadlines in building the campaign’s website, according to a person present at the fundraiser.","Mercer and Bannon continued to clash with Cruz aides, including Roe and campaign chairman Chad Sweet, in a series of conference calls about Cambridge’s performance and its billing practices, according to two peoplewith knowledge of the conversations. Mercer was “infuriated” by a campaign official’s contention that rather than providing some secret sauce, Cambridge Analytica was merely using information that was publicly available, according to the people.","It didn’t take long for Mercer’s dissatisfaction with Cruz’s team to extend beyond the dispute over Cambridge. “She was down on the whole campaign,” said one Cruz adviser. “She thought the Iowa operation was terrible. She clashed repeatedly with Jeff Roe. She was very down on the ground game. She thought early on that [Wisconsin Gov. Scott] Walker was eating our lunch.” Mercer also expressed her frustration that the campaign did not hire Iowa operative Chuck Laudner, a veteran of Rick Santorum’s successful caucus campaign, who instead went to work for Trump.","After each primary debate, aides to Cruz — a champion debater as an undergrad at Princeton — braced for Mercer’s withering critiques of his performance.","“Bekah kind of wore out her welcome on the campaign,” said one of the operatives who has worked with Mercer.","Mercer also clashed with mega-donor Toby Neugebauer, an energy investor, over control of the constellation of four pro-Cruz super PACs with variations of the Keep the Promise name, and tried to install controversial evangelical activist David Barton to help run them.","By January, Breitbart had soured on Cruz as well, and its coverage increasingly tilted toward Trump, at Cruz’s expense. Neither Sweet nor Cruz himself were able to persuade Mercer to intervene with Bannon. Instead, she and Conway told Cruz and his team that Breitbart was independent and there was nothing they could do to shape the coverage, according to two people familiar with the interactions.","After Cruz lost the South Carolina primary in February, the campaign stopped using Cambridge Analytica’s models, though it continued to work with its team of embedded data scientists, who had PhDs in the hard sciences and were viewed favorably at Cruz headquarters in Houston. For two weeks in April, as Cruz fought for his political life, Cambridge Analytica executives ordered the employees it had embedded at Cruz campaign headquarters to walk off the job over a contractual dispute, though some continued their work for the campaign in secret from home.","Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier disputed that Mercer expressed any discontent at the fundraiser and said: \"Our campaign had a productive and positive relationship with Cambridge Analytica, and they performed important work for the campaign. Rebekah is a friend and we are thankful for her support during our campaign. She loves this country and she is willing to stand and fight for freedom.\"","As the Cruz campaign succumbed to Trump, Republican mega-donors like Singer, the Ricketts family and the Kochs remained mostly on the sidelines, reluctant to make major investments in their party’s incendiary presumptive nominee. In that vacuum, Bekah Mercer set about building bridges to Trump’s campaign. The Mercers converted their pro-Cruz PAC into an anti-Clinton one, and Conway prepared to pass the reins to Bossie, who had worked with the Mercers on a conservative film-production venture.","“Rebekah’s a loyal Republican and is always going to support the nominee,” said a personal friend of the Mercer family, who maintained that Trump had been her second choice from the start.","But even as the Mercers lined up with Trump, the GOP nominee’s then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, seemed to be trying to keep them at arm’s length. “They had done everything they could to push themselves into Trump world and then had gotten pushed back out by Manafort,” said a Republican operative familiar with the situation.","Manafort had long questioned the effectiveness and costs of Cambridge Analytica, which had pitched the Trump campaign last year, to no avail. And when Mercer and Bossie urged that Conway be hired as Trump’s pollster, Manafort in mid-May hired his longtime associate Tony Fabrizio.","But ever-persistent, Mercer would prevail. In June, she met with Ivanka Trump at Trump Tower. Days later, Conway joined the campaign.","Then, in mid-August, as the campaign was buffeted by a storm of controversy surrounding Manafort’s ties to pro-Kremlin factions in Ukraine, Mercer met with Trump at the Hamptons fundraiser and recommended a leadership change. Soon after that, the campaign announced the hiring of Bannon as the campaign’s CEO and Conway’s elevation to campaign manager. And two days later, the campaign asked for and received Manafort’s resignation.","Most of the Mercer associates interviewed for this story predict that their influence won’t end with the Trump campaign.","“I don’t think it’s about Trump. Trump is just a vehicle,” said one operative who’s worked with Bekah and Bob Mercer. “It’s about wanting to be a player and wanting to beat Hillary, in that order. Because if you remember, they wanted to use Cruz as a vehicle before that. They do want to beat Hillary, but they also want to beat the Kochs and Paul Singer and the Ricketts,” said the operative, referring to other conservative mega-donors.","But how that influence manifests itself after 2016 is uncertain. Firebrand Iowa Rep. Steve King, who has received campaign donations from the Mercers and gotten to know them a bit through the conservative event circuit, suggested that Bekah Mercer's views are a driving force in the activism she and her father engage in.","“They wouldn’t be the pair they are if it weren’t for Rebekah’s passionate commitment to the conservative cause,” said King, who — like the Mercers — supported Cruz’s presidential campaign in the primary, before throwing his support to Trump in the general."],"isopubdate":"2016-09-07"}
{"originalurl":"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3kjzvk/facebook-cambridge-analytica-not-a-data-breach?utm_campaign=sharebutton","title":"Why We're Not Calling the Cambridge Analytica Story a 'Data Breach' - Motherboard","text":["Facebook insists that Cambridge Analytica didn't get information on 50 million Americans because of a 'data breach.' It's right. What really happened is much worse.","On Saturday, an investigation by The New York Times, the Guardian, and its sister publication The Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that helped the Donald Trump presidential campaign had harvested the Facebook data of more than 50 million people in an effort to profile users and eventually target them with political ads.","In 2014, a researcher collected the data through an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. Around 270,000 people agreed to have their data collected through the test, which its creator, Aleksandr Kogan, defined as “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.” But thanks to Facebook’s terms of service and its API at the time, the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the researcher, who later handed the data to Cambridge Analytica, the raw information of more than 50 million people, according to the reports, which were largely based on the account of a former Cambridge Analytica data scientist.","The Observer called it one of Facebook’s “biggest ever data breaches.” The Times only referred to the incident as a “breach” once, using the term “leak” throughout the rest of the article. We at Motherboard believe the use of the expression “data breach” in this case is incorrect and may be confusing to readers.","As the news spread and echoed online, several websites and other publications called it a data breach. Manysecurityexperts and researchers—and Facebook itself—believe this is the wrong expression to refer to what happened here.","“It is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a deleted tweet.","Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false,” because the researcher who made the app obtained the data from “users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.”","Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzo@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzo@motherboard.tv","Saying that “everyone involved” consented seems misleading, given that only around 270,000 out of the 50 million people who got their data harvested reportedly signed up for the app. The others probably had no idea this app even existed. And since Facebook changes its privacy settings so frequently, we also don't know if the people who agreed to use the app fully understood what kind of data they were giving up. And no one at the time knew the data would later be handed out to a shadowy data analytics firm hired by the Trump campaign.","While we understand why some are describing the data Kogan handed to Cambridge Analytica as a breach, based on what’s been reported so far, we believe that describing this incident as a breach would, at least at the moment, mislead our readers.","We’ve been regularly covering data breaches for years. No one hacked into Facebook’s servers exploiting a bug, like hackers did when they stole the personal data of more than 140 million people from Equifax. No one tricked Facebook users into giving away their passwords and then stole their data, like Russian hackers did when they broke into the email accounts of John Podesta and others through phishing emails.","In 2014, when Kogan collected the data of 50 million people, he was playing by the rules. At the time, Facebook allowed third party apps to collect not only the data of the people who consented to giving it up, but also their friends’ data. The company later shut down this functionality.","Facebook says the data was misused because Kogan told Facebook he would use it only for academic research. But that might be the only anomalous thing about this case.","Facebook obviously doesn't want the public to think it suffered a massive security breach, like Yahoo did in 2013 and 2014. We agree not because we want to minimize the significance of the Cambridge Analytica story, but because the real story is far more troubling: This data collection was par for the course. In other words, it was a feature, not a bug. And while the process that Kogan exploited is no longer allowed, Facebook still collects—and then sells—massive amounts of data on its users.","As Zeynep Tufekci, the author of Twitter And Tear Gas, put it, Facebook’s vehement defense that this was not a data breach is itself actually a damning statement of what’s wrong with Facebook, and Silicon Valley’s ad industry in general.","“If your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used & misused,” Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote on Twitter. “There is no informed consent because it's not possible to reasonably inform or consent.”","Facebook’s security team, Tufekci concluded, can’t mitigate the company’s business model, which is predicated on collecting as much of our data, and our friend’s data, as possible.","We can condemn the misuse of this data, and Facebook’s data collection practices, without calling it a data breach, a term that may confuse readers and distract them from what we believe is the real problem here: Silicon Valley giants have built massive data collection machines with almost no guardrails on how they are used."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The data was collected through an app set up by an academic, which asked users to sign up voluntarily, take a personality test and agree to let their data be used for academic use in exchange for a small payment. 270,000 users signed up but were either unaware or agreed to the app harvesting the data of all their Facebook friends, leading to the data of up to 50m users being retained. The data was then passed to Cambridge Analytica who had funded the data collection, where, according to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, the data was analysed and used to target ads and stories and to create software to predict voter outcome.","The ICO has applied for a warrant to enter Cambridge Analytica's premises and carry out an investigation. At the same time, she has asked Facebook to stop its own search in order to avoid compromising the ICO's investigation, a request Facebook has complied with.","Facebook is accused of sharing user data without consent and failing to warn users that Cambridge Analytica had their data, as well as security failings. One former employee has said that Facebook routinely lost control of data sent to external developers while he worked at the company between 2011-12 and failed to conduct effective privacy audits on developers. Facebook says the data was transferred to Cambridge Analytica in breach of its platform policies.","Both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica deny wrongdoing although Facebook has acknowledged that, prior to its flotation \"it's fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies\".","WhatsApp to cease sharing data with Facebook pending GDPR compliance","WhatsApp has signed an undertaking to the UK's ICO not to share personal data with Facebook until it can do so in compliance with the GDPR. This follows an investigation by the ICO which found that:","WhatsApp had not identified a lawful basis of processing for such sharing of personal data;","In relation to existing users, such sharing would be for a purpose incompatible with the one for which the data was originally obtained;","If WhatsApp had shared the data, it would have been in contravention of the first and second data protection principles under the Data Protection Act 1998.","Data Protection Bill amendments adopted","The House of Commons Public Bill Committee has adopted amendments to the Data Protection Bill. The most significant is an exemption which allows sensitive data to be processed without consent under certain circumstances, where it is necessary for legitimate safeguarding activities which are in the public interest, for example, safeguarding children from abuse. The processing of health data will also be permitted to protect an individual's economic wellbeing where they have been identified as being at risk.","IAB consultation on its GDPR transparency and consent framework","The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) is consulting on its proposals for a GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework. IAB Europe and a cross-section of the publishing and advertising industry, announced a new Transparency & Consent Framework (Framework) to help publishers, advertisers and technology companies comply with key elements of GDPR. The Framework is intended to give the publishing and advertising industries a common language with which to communicate consumer consent for the delivery of relevant online advertising and content, including by:","Controlling which third parties (e.g. online advertisers) access their users' browsers and devices and process personal data as a result;","Seeking user consent to drop cookies and process personal data in line with GDPR and e-Privacy requirements;","Sharing information about consent status.","The IAB has developed open source software to manage consumer consents. Suggestions are that a 'Global Vendor List' of entities wanting to collect consumer personal data from websites would be set up with those appearing on the list signing up to privacy commitments, including only processing personal data where the system sends a consent signal. Websites could choose which vendors to work with. Consumers would be asked to consent to purpose-specific processing by selected vendors when visiting a website. The consent could, at the website owner's discretion, be just for the website owner, sites operated by its affiliates, or any websites. The nature of consent (or its refusal) would be recorded and consulted prior to further processing.","This is an industry initiative which would operate on a voluntary basis so it remains to be seen how much take up it has and what the regulators have to say about it.","A DSP established in the EU will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Member State of its main establishment.","A DSP established in a third country but offering digital services in the EU must designate a representative in the EU.","From the withdrawal date, the EC expects:","Any DSP whose main establishment was in the UK prior to withdrawal which has one or more establishments in the EU27 will be regulated in the main EU27 establishment.","Any DSP no longer established in the EU but which offers services into the EU27, will be required to appoint a representative in an EU Member State.","Any DSP established in a third country which had appointed a representative in the UK, will have to designate a new representative in an EU27 Member State in which it offers digital services.","GDPR for micro-businesses","The ICO has launched a GDPR awareness campaign aimed at people running micro-businesses (those employing fewer than ten people). The ICO recognises that GDPR compliance may be particularly challenging for micro-businesses and aims to highlight compliance tools which may suit them.","The Codes of Practice are aimed at the public authorities which can exercises powers under the IPA and set out procedures, safeguards and oversight arrangements. They also provide information to staff of telecoms and postal operators where they are served with warrants or notices under the IPA.","Taylor Wessing speaking at International Data Protection Seminar","Axel von dem Bussche and Paul Voigt will be speaking at the 2nd International Data Protection Seminar on the 18th and 19th June in Vienna. The seminar is aimed at data protection professionals working in industry, policy and public affairs, providing an insight into how to handle the difficulties arising in daily data protection practices.

Be it his vile disregard for immigrants, his disparaging remarks about women or his alleged ties to the Kremlin, the contentious campaign continued making headlines even after Trump took office.","Now, the Trump campaign once again finds itself at the center of another maelstrom after it was revealed a U.K. data firm, Cambridge Analytica, obtained the private information of more than 50 million people without their permission.","The Trump campaign used Cambridge Analytica in 2016 and had former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon on its board.","Facebook took notice of the fact the firm hadn’t fully deleted the data given to them by Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge professor, and suspended the firm on Friday.","The fact that private information of millions of users was reportedly compromised during the Trump’s election campaign shows that in order to achieve their purpose, Trump and his advocates veered way far from the realm of propriety.","Kogan created an app, “Thisisyourdigitallife,\" which helped him access millions of Facebook profiles. It contained enough information for the firm to create psychographic profiles even though only 270,000 people had given permission for their data to be collected.","Social media users expressed concern and anger over how the app exploited the data harvested from Facebook.","What's gone under the radar in the Cambridge Analytics story is that 320,000 people were so hype to get $2-$5 that they logged into their personal FB accounts, took a personality test, and signed away their personal info","“Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,\" Facebook Vice President Paul Grewal said in a statement, announcing the company was suspending the firm.","\"By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies,” he added.","Grewal further pointed out the data firm went against their word, as they had apparently certified they had deleted all its data, but the recent reports told another story.","“If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information,” Grewal said.","Such scandalous manipulation of private information has prompted special counsel Robert Mueller to dig into the issue. He has reportedly requested all the e-mails between the firm and the Trump campaign.","Shocking Admissions Of Cambridge Analytics Executives Revealed","Amid the ongoing probe, Channel 4 News’ documentary on the inside workings of Cambridge Analytica was the last thing the data firm needed.","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, might claim to be a digital mastermind but he clearly failed to notice he was being filmed by a news investigator posing as a potential client.","The surreptitiously recorded video showed Nix was accompanied by Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica, while they talked about using bribes and sex to swing elections.","The interview was a part of Channel 4 News’ “Data, Democracy and Dirty Tricks” investigation series.","Consistent with the name of the series, Nix’s revelations about tricks and techniques of snaring politicians and influencing elections were indeed dirty.","Undercover interviews and phone calls with the CEO from November 2017 to January 2018 revealed Nix bragging his firm and parent company, Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL), secretly influenced more than 200 elections around the world — including those in Nigeria, Kenya, the Czech Republic, India and Argentina.","Nix also went on to disclose startling measures the firm took to entrap politicians by secretly recording them in compromising situations.","The CEO reportedly shed light on numerous strategies that were adopted by the firm to entice candidates, including sending “some girls,” specifically Ukrainian women, to a candidate’s house to seduce the individual, an act that Nix said “works very well.”","Moreover, he also admitted to fabricating information about candidates so the public buys the distorted facts.","“I mean, it sounds a dreadful thing to say, but these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true, as long as they’re believed,” he said.","“It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts, because actually it’s all about emotion, it’s all about emotion,” said Turnbull.","During an interview earlier this year, Nix also talked about how his firm managed to achieve its ulterior motives without getting his hands dirty.","“We’ll have a wealthy developer come in, somebody posing as a wealthy developer,” he said. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land, for instance. We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras, we’ll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the internet.”","“In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our ‘client’ from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case,” Nix stated.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied reports that its firm and affiliates “use entrapment, bribes, or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever ...”","People are astounded by the extent of manipulation nations have suffered at the hands of these self-proclaimed digital architects.","Every American, every Brit, everyone on the African continent, hell, everybody should watch this @Channel4News expose of Alexander Nix and Cambridge Analytica: Trump’s election consultants filmed saying they use bribes and sex workers to entrap politicians https://t.co/MUmPEa66kD","Just a couple of days after Facebook suspended the data firm tied to the Trump campaign, the social media company is now being subjected to multiple government investigations.","Facebook might be a little late in taking necessary measures as now the revelations that it didn’t do enough to safeguard users’ data can cost the company a hefty fine of trillions of dollars.","By allowing the data firm, a collaborator of the Trump campaign, to retrieve 50 million accounts through its platform, the social network may have violated a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission.","In a 2011 settlement, Facebook agreed to 20 years of FTC oversight after it failed to notify users of changes to its privacy rules.","Apart from the legal trouble the social media network might encounter, the real damage could be fines up to $40,000 per person, which would amount to roughly $2 trillion.","His attorney revealed Facebook strategically positioned itself by privately welcoming Wylie’s revelations and then went on to suspend his account. Such a move unveiled Facebook’s priorities and that executives were more focused on \"damage limitation\" than sincerely addressing the problem at hand, he said.","However, in face of such grave charges, Facebook is adamant it hasn’t violated users' privacy settings."],"isopubdate":""}

The horror is not that Cambridge Analytica demographically and psychologically profiled 50 million Facebook users, but that everyone is doing it. Cambridge Analytica did not exploit a loophole. Rather, they used Facebook’s big data the way it was intended. They just marketed a candidate instead of a product. (These days, there’s not that much of a difference.)","That’s the problem with big data: It doesn’t come with signs, let alone rules, declaring CAN ONLY BE USED FOR GOOD. Once the data is out there, people will find a way to use it for whatever they want: marketing, surveillance, or propaganda.","Or, as the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global put it: “We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then, and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again,” he said. “Like a remote control. It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘that’s propaganda’, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’, the next question is, ‘who’s put that out?’”","Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies.","— Facebook","There is an absurdity here: Facebook admits it allows third-party apps to collect intimate data on its users. The only restriction is that the app creators can’t then reshare the data. In other words, the restrictions are on things that Facebook cannot possibly police proactively.","This, too, has long been Facebook’s strategy. In 2008, Facebook rolled out Facebook Beacon, a program to put invisible “web bugs” on pages across the internet. Beacon tracked Facebook users across the internet and posted their activity to their Facebook walls. Buy some baby clothes on Amazon, and it would announce the fact on Facebook, without your permission. There was an outcry, and eventually Facebook shut Beacon down.","But it didn’t give up. By splashing its Like button across the internet, by placing third-party cookies and Facebook logins on other sites, and by acquiring user data directly from third parties, Facebook continued devouring personal information. That personal information is what made Facebook a treasure trove for advertisers and marketers—and, as we now know, for Cambridge Analytica, the political microtargeting firm that helped get Donald Trump elected. An enormous industry of hundreds of firms sprung up around demographic profiling, marketing, and real-time bidding in order to sell online advertising to the right user at the right time. Facebook is the highest-profile broker for this kind of advertising, but far from the only one.","That’s why questions of illegality and terms-of-service violations are misleading. Even in the absence of violations, this sort of data collection is ubiquitous and omnivorous. Facebook would likely prefer the discussion to focus on questions of law, since United States data-sharing laws are quite lax, relying on “self-policing” by industry groups like the Network Advertising Initiative as a way to fend off actual legislation or regulation. European strategies like the “right to be forgotten” focus only on the publication of personal data rather than its initial collection—the very essence of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.","The problem, as law professor Frank Pasquale puts it in The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information, is “runaway data.” We are accustomed to thinking that once we share data with a particular entity—be it Google, Facebook, Amazon, or any one of thousands of shadowy data marketing firms—our data is somehow siloed there. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, firms are constantly sharing, selling, and coalescing data piecemeal in order to construct increasingly elaborate profiles of customers and citizens, and this data is frequently available in one form or another to anyone with the money to buy it. Entire companies like Interclick have been bought specifically for the hundreds of millions of demographic profiles they had accumulated.","If Cambridge Analytica hadn’t been able to get what it needed through Facebook, it could have gone to any number of other data brokers to get it, and then cross-referenced it to target Facebook users. If you’re a likely Trump voter, Facebook is not the only company with the evidence to prove it. Your credit card receipts, website habits, and demographic profile are frequently just as good, and there is no shortage of companies offering your data, without your permission.","Take Acxiom, a company which offers “Identity Resolution & People-Based Marketing.” In a series of articles in The New York Times, Natasha Singer explored how this veteran marketing technology company (founded in 1969) has profiled 500 million users, 10 times the 50 million that Facebook offered to Cambridge Analytica, and sells these “data products” in order to help marketers target customers based on interest, race, gender, political alignment, and more. WPP and GroupM’s “digital media platform” Xaxis has also claimed 500 million consumer profiles. Other marketing companies, like Qualia, track users across platforms and devices as they browse the web. There’s no sign-up or opt-in involved. These companies simply cyberstalk users en masse.","Even if Facebook were to seal off its data from the rest of the world, Cambridge Analytica could go to Acxiom, or any other company like it, to find the right voters and then locate them by name alone on Facebook (or elsewhere). How many of these companies would be able to tell the difference between an ordinary client using its data versus Cambridge Analytica, or even Russia? Once you’ve got a user’s data without their permission, most everything is on the table.","The only surprise is in how long it took for this data hydra to create havoc. Given the close margin of the election, it’s quite possible that Cambridge Analytica’s work (like so many other small factors) was enough to shift the election in Trump’s favor. The keys have been hanging from the door lock for over a decade, and few cared until now.","Facebook’s decision to suspend Cambridge Analytica now is little comfort. Notably, Facebook said nothing about preventing new companies from doing the same sorts of data harvesting and marketing. And even if Facebook did decide to sacrifice the revenue and somehow cut off all such activity, a peek inside Amazon, Google, Oracle, or Acxiom will reveal petabytes of similar personal data, ready to be shared, studied, and sold.","The internet was never designed for privacy, and between consumer profiling and government surveillance, there’s been little incentive to make it any more private. Cambridge Analytica’s work is not an aberration; it is an inevitability.","In 2013, I wrote of the growing threat not of Big Brother, but Big Salesman: For internet marketing companies, you are what you click. Big Salesman appears more innocuous when he’s marketing shoes and cars. Now that he’s marketing Donald Trump, we are beginning to wake up to his danger. With all our data out there, being gathered and sold by hundreds of companies, there will always be a Cambridge Analytica, a Steve Bannon, or a Vladimir Putin ready to make use of it.","David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer.

Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, a data-analysis firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, over allegations that it held onto improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had deleted the information.","WASHINGTON — A data analysis firm employed by President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign tapped the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, allowing it to capitalize on the private social media activity of a large portion of the U.S. electorate, newspapers reported Saturday.","One of the largest data leaks in Facebook history allowed Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon, to develop techniques that formed the basis of its work on the Trump campaign, The New York Times and The Guardian reported.","Facebook said it suspended Cambridge Analytica over allegations that it kept the improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had been deleted.","In a blog post, Facebook explained that Cambridge Analytica had years ago received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm was not authorized to have the information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan's data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\"","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign.","Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","\"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August.

He said that the so-called psychography profiles combined Facebook data with information gathered from other \"top commercial data providers\" and that data included specific information about voter \"demographics, geographics, purchase history, and interests.\"","When a Facebook user engaged with the survey, he said, the user implicitly gave the company access to a broad spectrum of personal data that Facebook provides for advertisers. The app reached further, giving the company access to profile data from people in the users' broader circle of Facebook friends who had, wittingly or otherwise, set their security setting relatively weakly. Though the company likely did not use a traditional \"hack\" to access user information, they may have violated Facebook's terms of use by bulk harvesting and repurposing user data.","When asked about how the company chose what to include in Facebook surveys, Oczkowski would only say that, it collects data from \"exclusive relationships\" with data vendors \"and through direct response projects.\"","Cambridge Analytica pushed back Saturday against the notion that it harvested any data, insisting it had contracted a firm in the U.K. to do research. Cambridge Analytica insisted that when it learned that it had been sold data it shouldn't have, the firm deleted the data.","Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data. 1/8","Getting users to interact with the survey was key to unlocking the data. A source close to the 2016 Trump campaign and familiar with Cambridge Analytica's tactics explained that the surveys used by the company used inflammatory language designed to provoke the \"worst tendencies\" in Facebook users -- meaning that it would stir up the kind of emotion that would prompt an interaction. Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the campaign. Mr. Trump's 2016 digital guru, Brad Parscale, told \"60 Minutes\" last year that the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's controversial practice of psychographics.","That allowed the company to scale up their data gathering rapidly. Wired reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday that by convincing 270,000 people to interact with the app, GSR managed to tap into the data of over 50 million users.","CEO Alexander Nix described the firm as \"fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" and even tweeted Saturday that President Obama's 2012 \"pioneered microtargeting.\"","But Oczkowski contradicted that assertion, and explained that \"we served as the data agency of record, but our role quickly evolved as the cycle progressed.\"","The company developed \"three pillars\" of exclusive technology, Oczkowski said, including data science and analytics, digital marketing designed for persuasion and get-out-the-vote (GOTV), and polling research. \"Having a large amount of control and input into each of these three areas allowed us to be extremely efficient and reactive,\" he said. \"It also allowed us to easily integrate with the staff at Giles-Parscale and the RNC.\"","When asked specifically how the company leveraged Facebook for other data, Oczkowski explained that the company's data analytics prowess assisted the Trump campaign for everything from resource allocation, calculating the most efficient candidate travel stops, advertising, and the language used in surrogate speeches, and even \"personalizing messaging to the individual voter.\"","\"Huge exaggeration\"","Within GOP data circles, however, the company's extravagant claims about the effectiveness of Facebook data and artificial intelligence are heavily criticized. \"I'm not saying they lied,\" said a former Trumpworld staffer shortly after the election, \"but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration. Data can do a lot of things, but there's a limit to how effective it is. Cambridge Analytica's claims went far beyond that limit.\"","Cambridge Analytica is not alone in their use of Facebook and social media to target consumers with advertising. Machine learning is one of the fastest growing sectors of business technology, and a number of firms have adopted similar tactics. Amazon, Google, Twitter, and a host of other cloud-based Internet giants are hiring AI experts and building algorithms that automate advertising.","It's no surprise that cloud giants are actively using big data analysis models to aid private industry in everything from cybersecurity to marketing. Oczkowski described the potential application actionable data scraped from Facebook users as potentially \"endless.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

{"originalurl":"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-executive-rob-goldman-apologizes-to-company-and-robert-mueller/","title":"Facebook Executive Rob Goldman Apologizes After Russia Tweets | WIRED","text":["As Fred Vogelstein and I wrote for the March cover of WIRED, Facebook has had a very rough two years, including in Washington. They’ve been pilloried by the right and the left and they’ve been berated by Congress. They’ve been accused of being blind to the Russian operations, and then uncooperative with the House and the Senate investigations trying to untangle them. Facebook executives believed, however, that the Mueller indictment would help the company. Close readers would see how carefully Facebook had worked with the special prosecutor and how much they had learned about Russia’s plots. Friday seemed liked it might be a good day.","But then, roughly eight hours after the indictment appeared online, Rob Goldman, a VP for ads for Facebook, decided he had a few points to add to the debate. He was just freelancing, and had not cleared his thoughts with either Facebook’s communications team or its senior management.","Facebook has been praised, notably by Digiday, for letting its executives sound off on Twitter, and Goldman had previously partaken of those privileges several times: commenting on Russian propaganda operations, retweeting a note about the weaknesses of liberals who cave under criticism, and helping people worried about traffic to Burning Man. Goldman is far from the most prominent Facebook executive on Twitter, though. He had only 1600 followers, at the time, and his tweets didn’t draw much action on Friday evening.","He had made, however, two big errors—one of which was obvious and one of which was a bit subtle. The obvious error was asserting that one could understand the scope of the Russian propaganda campaign just through the ads. Russia’s ads were viewed roughly 11 million times, while posts by Russia-controlled accounts had been viewed 150 million times. Leaving aside pure numbers, anyone who had read the indictment knew that ads were a minute part of the operation. Facebook likes to point out that the Russians only spent a hundred thousand dollars on all their ads, a rather small number in comparison to the $1.25 million that the indictment reveals Russia’s Internet Research Agency was spending monthly on its election influence campaign.","By the time Facebook executives went to sleep that evening, they had heard about the tweets, but they weren’t particularly worried. One of Facebook’s more senior executives, a VP named Andrew Bosworth, even gave the thread a little boost, retweeting it and noting “Important thread here.”","The tweetstorm started to spread in the early hours of Saturday. It caught the attention of the president of Pro Publica, one of the organizations that has beenmostcriticalof Facebook’s advertising practice. The former deputy communications director of the Clinton campaign noted it too.","And then, the message caught the attention of America’s Tweeter in Chief. And so on Saturday, right about when Facebook’s executives would have been sitting down for lunch, @realdonaldtrump decided that he wanted to introduce his 48 million followers to Rob Goldman.","That’s when, according to executives at the company, Facebook realized it was holding a shit sandwich. It’s also when the company realized Goldman’s more subtle error: He had made it look like his company was repudiating the work of Robert Mueller.","Facebook has long had a vexed relationship with Donald Trump. It’s based in Silicon Valley, and most of the executives and employees are liberal Democrats. Mark Zuckerberg believes, to his core, that the point of his platform is to make the world more open and connected. Donald Trump’s campaign was built on tribalism—dividing America against the world, and dividing American groups against each other.","At the same time, Facebook aspires to serve the entire country, and the entire world. You can’t make America more connected if you ignore the GOP. And Facebook’s Washington office isn’t stupid: They know which party controls power in the capital, and the company has very little interest in alienating the people who might regulate it.","Facebook has grappled with these tensions repeatedly over the past two years. In no small part because of fears that it would be seen as partisan, it missed signs of the spread of fake news on its platform during the summer of 2016. The desire not to appear partisan may have made it harder for the company to spot the Russian operations in the first place, and it also may have contributed to the company’s phlegmatic attitude while dealing later with congressional investigators. The House and Senate intelligence committees are perceived by many in Silicon Valley as leaky and partisan—and perhaps best kept at a slight distance.","With Mueller’s indictment, according to multiple people at the company, everyone felt that Facebook had done something right. The 35 mentions clearly showed that Facebook had fully cooperated with authorities. Many of the details in the indictment, particularly from pages 25 to 30, which include details of messages sent between private Facebook accounts, were given to Mueller by Facebook. That could have been a good story. But then Rob Goldman decided to weigh in, using a rival platform. He now has 10,500 Twitter followers, but a few fewer friends at work.","On Sunday night, Joel Kaplan, the VP of Global Public Policy at Facebook, put out a statement saying “Nothing we found contradicts the Special Counsel’s indictments. Any suggestion otherwise is wrong.” Roughly translated, that meant, “We asked Rob Goldman to throw his phone in a river.”","At its core, Goldman’s mistake was a familiar one for Silicon Valley: An executive really smart at one thing seemed to think he was really smart at another thing. Goldman surely understands all the ads that Russia’s IRA purchased on the platform. He may have even seen the full dossier of information that Facebook presumably created for Mueller, detailing the private messages and chats cited in the indictment. But no one at Facebook has access to the entirety of information that the Mueller indictment references: including the transfers using PayPal, or the internal emails sent by employees at the IRA. Facebook has long suspected that the NSA somehow compromised the IRA—the first time the company thought about Russian propaganda groups buying ads on the platform came because of a reference in a Time magazine story from an unnamed senior intelligence official—and it seems possible that such work could have informed the Mueller report.","Most importantly, there are still three hypotheses about the intertwined goals held by the purveyors of Russian propaganda. The first one, to which Goldman pointed, is that the intention was merely to sow division. They just wanted Americans to fight. Or, as Goldman put it, “The main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us.”","At its core, Goldman’s mistake was a familiar one for Silicon Valley: An executive really smart at one thing seemed to think he was really smart at another thing.","The second, believed by others inside of Facebook to have been most influential, is that the goal was really to weaken Hillary. That’s why the Russians supported Bernie Sanders and then Trump. Like most of the world, Putin expected Hillary to win. And he wanted her to be in a rough spot when she did: fighting off made-up memes about her fraud, her affection for Sharia law, and even her murders.","The third is that the attacks were very specifically aimed at electing Trump. As the indictment shows, the Russians focused their efforts at states that could help swing the electoral college. They also attacked Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, an unnecessary action if the goal was just to undermine Hillary.","According to the closest observers of the operation, and the closest readers of the indictment, Russia was probably pursuing all three goals at different times. The campaign seems to have begun as an effort to sow division, moved into a play to weaken Hillary, and then, as the election neared, turned into a sprint to help Trump. Goldman’s ultimate sin was to pick just one of those narratives, and indeed the one that minimized Facebook’s role in the election of Trump. But in doing so, he ignored Facebook’s larger interests, and he also violated one of the most important principles for people studying the Mueller investigation: No one knows exactly where it’s going, or what he’s got.","On Monday, I spoke with a Facebook executive familiar with the company’s cooperation with Mueller and asked which of the three hypotheses was closest to the truth, based on all the data Facebook has. “I don’t think anyone at Facebook can say definitely one way or another,” they answered. “We are a tech company. Why would we have the answer? I wouldn’t trust us if we said we did.”","Later that day, Rob Goldman seemed to come to the same understanding, and posted internally at Facebook a message that read as follows: “I wanted to apologize for having tweeted my own view about Russian interference without having it reviewed by anyone internally. The tweets were my own personal view and not Facebook’s. I conveyed my view poorly. The Special Counsel has far more information about what happened [than] I do—so seeming to contradict his statements was a serious mistake on my part.","To those of you who have reached out this weekend to offer your support, thank you. It means more than you know. And to all of you who have worked so hard over the last six months to demonstrate that we understand our responsibility to prevent abuse on Facebook—and are working hard to do better in the future—my deepest apologies.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-02-20"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

He said widespread claims about Cambridge Analytica’s involvement in Brexit had been made by an “overzealous PR consultant... Somewhat ironically this was an example of fake news\" he told a panel of politicians gathered in the Thatcher committee room inside the House of Commons.","The suggestion of a crucial relationship between Brexit and Cambridge Analytica, which has counted Steve Bannon and reclusive hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer among its investors, came directly from Cambridge Analytica and the Brexit campaign group Leave.EU themselves.","Nix admitted that the company had indeed announced it had already begun working for Leave.EU, publicly described the work it was doing for the campaign, and even appeared at the group’s launch event. Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore, who ran Leave.EU, have regularly offered plaudits for the great work done on their behalf to secure Brexit—including in the book Bad Boys of Brexit, which described when they had hired Cambridge Analytica and what it did to help.","Nix said Tuesday that all of those announcements had been mistaken. “We dated each other, we had a couple of dinners, but we didn’t get married,” he said.","Banks, who was watching the livestream of the committee hearing, claimed on Twitter that the business relationship had not gone further because Cambridge Analytica had offered to raise millions of dollars from backers in the U.S. to help pay for its Brexit services.","“CA wanted a fee of £1m to start work & then said they would raise £6m in the states. We declined the offer because it was illegal,” wrote Banks.","An undisclosed donation from foreign sources would not be permitted under British electoral law. The panel put Banks’ intervention to Nix, who denied it.","Another of those watching the exchanges online was Julian Assange, who remains in self-imposed exile inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.","He first tweeted a link to the testimony livestream and then—around half an hour later—quoted Nix saying: “We have never spoken to anyone at WikiLeaks” and included another link to the parliamentary site.","Late last year, The Daily Beast reported that Nix had approached Assange by email to offer to help release emails that might damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Assange confirmed to The Daily Beast that this exchange took place: “We can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks.”","After denying that anyone at his firm had spoken to Assange, he told the panel Tuesday that Cambridge Analytica had never worked directly with WikiLeaks.","Later, he admitted that he had reached out via a public-speaking agency to try and arrange a meeting with Assange after seeing stories in the media speculating that there may be further explosive emails to come. “We read about these claims, we had no idea whether it was true or not so we reached out… asking whether he would like to meet to discuss this,” Nix said.","Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, sold his Cambridge Analytica stake—which was valued at between $1 million and $5 million—in April 2017. He only informed the government that he had done so in November, earning him a late-filing fine.","Nix told the panel that Bannon had been invited to join the board in order to help Cambridge Analytica “penetrate” the American political arena.","He said the company had been hired by the Trump campaign after using its controversial “psychographic” voter-analysis techniques—which purported to be able to understand and target voters’ personal fears—to help Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primary. Despite admitting that the firm had been able to transfer the data it had gathered from the Cruz campaign over to the Trump team, Nix said it did not have time to implement those methods during the general-election campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-27"}

The key was microtargeting, which had bad odor in recent years thanks to the marketing industry. Microtargeting sounded intrusive, even a little creepy, but it had the potential to return politics to the most local level of all: the individual voter.","Obama field organizers, armed with the fruits of Big Data, could bring a presidential campaign to the front porch as never before. OFA’s aim was to use algorithms to enhance the human (and thus more persuasive) part of politics: face-to-face, friend-to-friend, or at least Facebook friend-to-Facebook friend.","The new analysts did something unheard of by profiling and targeting unlikely voters. That transformed registration from a passive activity — sitting at a folding table in a supermarket parking lot — into something active and much more efficient.","The idea was that everything the geeks did should be a ‘force multiplier’.","By 2011 the technology of the 2008 campaign was long obsolete. So Obama campaign manager Jim Messina set out for the West Coast, where Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, and executives from Apple, Facebook, Zynga, Microsoft, DreamWorks, and Salesforce all told him he should not just view the campaign as a start-up but hire much of his digital crew from start-ups that were outside of politics. The idea was that everything the geeks did should be a “force multiplier” for Field, Communications, Finance, and other departments, not an end in itself.","The digital team assembled in Chicago was in fact three teams — Digital, Tech, and Analytics — with interrelated and often competitive functions. All were headed by soon-to-be-legendary characters within the campaign. Teddy Goff said he wanted the young recruits in Digital to be so good they could be hired afterward by Nike or Coca-Cola and “not be seen as hippy dippys.” Michael Slaby and Harper Reed hired geeky geniuses from top tech companies ranging from Google to craigslist. Analytics ended up with a motley crew of mostly under-thirty data scientists and financial analysts, plus a biophysicist, a former child prodigy, and three professional poker players.","From the start, there was trouble in digital paradise — a culture clash. They often took their mandate for ‘disruption’ too far.","From the start,there was trouble in digital paradise — a culture clash between the engineers from tech companies and the more politically seasoned product managers and data analysts.","Harper Reed’s code writers, though lacking in campaign experience, were often paid $100,000 a year, twice as much as some of their colleagues in other sections of the campaign. Reed said Tech could afford the higher salaries because it held down head count by hiring fewer people than rival departments. The pay gap was exacerbated by the Tech team’s habit of routinely leaving the office at the ungodly hour of 6:30 p.m., five, six, even seven hours before Digital, Analytics, and other sections went home. This schedule was explained by the fact that they were older (meaning a few were in their mid-thirties) and, unlike most Chicago staffers, often had families.","A little humility would have gone a long way toward helping Tech blend in, but it wasn’t forthcoming. “Instead of ‘Listen and learn,’ they [Tech people] came in with a ‘Burn the place down’ attitude — real arrogant,” said one senior campaign official. “It was, ‘Fuck the vendors — we’ll build everything in-house.’ ” But the vendors, firms like NGP VAN that specialized in voter contact, knew politics, and Reed’s department did not. Tech team members used their fluency in tech jargon to their advantage, but they were often illiterate in basic political language.","And they often took their mandate for “disruption” too far. But all of this would have been minor if the products Tech developed were working.","Jonathan Alter","About","A Chicago native and former senior editor at Newsweek, Jonathan Alter is an analyst and contributing correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC. His new book, The Center Holds, is being released today; his previous books, The Promise: President Obama, Year One and The Defining Moment: FDR’s Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope, were bestsellers. The 2012 campaign marks the ninth presidential election Alter has covered.","Facebook vs. The Narwhal Whale","Tech’s great white whale, dubbed “Narwhal” (after a toothed whale), was to integrate the more than 13 million Obama supporters now on the Email List with many other databases.","Instead of modeling and extrapolating, the dream was to match 25 million Facebook “likes” of Obama with county voter registration rolls, census data, 2008 voter contact information, contributor lists, and fresh information from door-to-door canvassers for a unified data platform on millions of voters in battleground states.","In Tech’s defense, the complexity of the Narwhal project was daunting. The hairiest challenge, the goal of Narwhal, was identifying which dieting donor might want to learn more about Michelle Obama’s anti-obesity initiative, or which Obama supporter had once signed a petition for women’s rights and might now be willing to send her whole mailbox something about Mitt Romney’s attack on Planned Parenthood.","This was much harder than it sounded. Some of the people designing Narwhal thought it wouldn’t be fully functional until 2016, by which time Barack Obama, if he won, would be getting ready to leave the White House.","Instead of waiting for Tech to build Narwhal, Analytics compensated by relying more heavily on software from a company called Vertica that helped produce enough new data sets to keep the Cave dwellers happy. And Chris Wegrzyn and Gabriel Burt of Analytics developed a tool dubbed “Stork” that allowed key vendors to transfer their data into campaign databases.","Fortunately for Obama, the campaign was loaded with geeks who knew what Facebook could do before Facebook did.","OFA ended up with pieces of Narwhal instead of the whole whale. The best piece of all was Facebook, which was growing so fast that it might be able to accomplish some of what everyone had hoped for from Narwhal.","Fortunately for Obama, the campaign was loaded with geeks who knew what Facebook could do before Facebook did. Rayid Ghani, OFA’s chief data scientist, led a team that began to customize a Facebook app into something called “targeted sharing.” The idea was that if an Obama supporter had, say, one thousand Facebook friends, the campaign could determine that nine hundred of them were already for Obama, focus on one hundred who were persuadable, and ideally zero in on six or so who lived in battleground states and were in regular enough contact to be considered real friends, not just Facebook friends. When those potential Obama voters were identified, their friend (the active Obama supporter) would be notified. He or she could then send them Obama’s position on issues and urge them to register and eventually to vote.","Because the message came from a real friend, it would be much more credible and influential than if it came from a stranger representing the campaign. That was the theory, anyway. All of this was much easier to envision than to execute. Common names meant thousands of cases of mistaken identity. Uncommon names were often misspelled and thus orphaned. Some voters used home addresses, others work addresses.","Tech had some terrific people but was so focused on trying — and often failing — to build cool new apps that it didn’t give the teams the workaday tools they wanted.","Digital’s biggest tech innovation was “Quick Donate,” a mobile app that raised an extra $75 million by letting supporters give money with one click instead of filling out a form. Donors who used Quick Donate gave four times as often and three times as much as those who didn’t. The mobile app led to what the campaign called “drunk donating,” where Obama supporters agitated by polls showing Romney gains impulsively kicked in before they thought better of it.","Quick Donate was supposed to be a Tech project, but it was engineered by the less experienced code writers inside Digital. This was another example of why tensions between Tech and the other departments hadn’t eased much. Tech had some terrific people but was so focused on trying — and often failing — to build cool new apps that it didn’t give Digital, Field, Finance, and Comm the workaday tools they wanted.","In June Tech finally came through with Dashboard, which was praised by many field organizers for helping put all of their local efforts at their fingertips. For many Obama volunteers, Dashboard became almost a new social network. It helped tens of thousands tap into the long-delayed Call Tool, which allowed volunteers to join Nurses for Obama, Veterans for Obama, Seniors for Obama, and other subgroups.","Narwhal failed — “a huge disaster,” as one senior staffer put it. A unified data platform, instant access to highly detailed information (beyond support scores) on millions of American voters, would have to wait. It was not yet possible to, say, link a veteran supporting Obama in Ohio to a persuadable veteran from his same army unit in Virginia. Harper Reed’s insistence that Narwhal was a success depended on defining it more narrowly as a “data store” for all of the campaign’s applications.","In truth, Narwhal was always more of a concept than a product. By 2016, maybe even by the 2014 midterms, Democratic geeks might be closer to catching the great toothed whale.","In truth, Narwhal was always more of a concept than a product.","Facebook-targeted sharing, by contrast, was a monster success, especially with the youth vote. In an era in which half of eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds were unreachable by phone, Facebook was essential for a candidate like Obama.","By the end of the campaign 600,000 Obama supporters had each used Facebook to contact around half a dozen specific friends identified by Chicago: 3.5 million potential Obama voters in battleground states. Nearly one-third of them, one million people, took some action in response, such as registering. This was a staggering response rate and the debut of a digital persuasion and get-out-the-vote tool that would inevitably be adopted by every campaign at every level.","Friend-to-friend was the highest form of voter contact, though it was hardly perfect: A Romney staffer, Matt Lira, was encouraged through targeted sharing to contact his Facebook friend, House Minority Leader Eric Cantor, and urge him to vote for Obama."],"isopubdate":"2013-06-04"}

In December 2016, they filed eight lawsuits against several hundred people to buy 13 plots on eight acres partitioned during the 1850s.","Ownership of some of the plots was unclear, crossing multiple generations and many heirs. According to Zuckerberg's letter, some have had no inhabitants for decades. Others come with complex legal land agreements dating back more than 160 years.","The plots are mostly one acre or smaller and all lie within the 700-acre estate.","Zuckerberg's legal maneuver, called \"quiet title and partition,\" was meant to clarify ownership rights to the land and force it to be sold to the highest bidder through a public auction, allowing Zuckerberg to purchase it.","Some Hawaiians had harshly criticized the maneuver after the suits became public. The outcry grew louder after Zuckerberg took to Facebook to explain his intent, with some charging him with contributing to a trend with roots in colonialism.

Image credit: Gemini Observatory/NSF/AURA/Keck/Jen Miller/Joy Pollard.","Astronomers using data from the Gemini and W. M. Keck Observatories in Hawai‘i have encountered a galaxy that appears to have almost no dark matter. Since the Universe is dominated by dark matter, and it is the foundation upon which galaxies are built, “…this is a game changer,” according to Principal Investigator Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University.","Galaxies and dark matter go hand in hand; you typically don’t find one without the other. So when researchers uncovered a galaxy, known as NGC1052-DF2, that is almost completely devoid of the stuff, they were shocked.","“Finding a galaxy without dark matter is unexpected because this invisible, mysterious substance is the most dominant aspect of any galaxy,” said lead author Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University. “For decades, we thought that galaxies start their lives as blobs of dark matter. After that everything else happens: gas falls into the dark matter halos, the gas turns into stars, they slowly build up, then you end up with galaxies like the Milky Way. NGC1052-DF2 challenges the standard ideas of how we think galaxies form.”","The research, published in the March 29th issue of the journal Nature, amassed data from the Gemini North and W. M. Keck Observatories, both on Maunakea, Hawai‘i, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other telescopes around the world.","NASA/ESA Hubble Telescope","Given its large size and faint appearance, astronomers classify NGC1052-DF2 as an ultra-diffuse galaxy, a relatively new type of galaxy that was first discovered in 2015. Ultra-diffuse galaxies are surprisingly common. However, no other galaxy of this type yet-discovered is so lacking in dark matter.","“NGC1052-DF2 is an oddity, even among this unusual class of galaxy,” said Shany Danieli, a Yale University graduate student on the team.","To peer even deeper into this unique galaxy, the team used the Gemini Multi Object Spectrograph (GMOS) to capture detailed images of NGC1052-DF2, assess its structure, and confirm that the galaxy had no signs of interactions with other galaxies.","“Without the Gemini images dissecting the galaxy’s morphology we would have lacked context for the rest of the data,” said Danieli. “Also, Gemini’s confirmation that NGC1052-DF2 is not currently interacting with another galaxy will help us answer questions about the conditions surrounding its birth.”","Van Dokkum and his team first spotted NGC1052-DF2 with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, a custom-built telescope in New Mexico that they designed to find these ghostly galaxies.","U Toronta Dragon Fly Telescope Array housed in New Mexico","NGC1052-DF2 stood out in stark contrast when comparisons were made between images from the Dragonfly Telephoto Array and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).","The Dragonfly images show a faint “blob-like” object, while SDSS data reveal a collection of relatively bright point-like sources.","In addition to the Gemini observations, to further assess this inconsistency the team dissected the light from several of the bright sources within NGC1052-DF2 using Keck’s Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) and Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS), identifying 10 globular clusters. These clusters are large compact groups of stars that orbit the galactic core.","Keck/DEIMOS on Keck 2","Keck LRIS","The spectral data obtained on the Keck telescopes revealed that the globular clusters were moving much slower than expected. The slower the objects in a system move, the less mass there is in that system. The team’s calculations show that all of the mass in the galaxy could be attributed to the mass of the stars, which means there is almost no dark matter in NGC1052-DF2.","“If there is any dark matter at all, it’s very little,” van Dokkum explained. “The stars in the galaxy can account for all of the mass, and there doesn’t seem to be any room for dark matter.”","The team’s results demonstrate that dark matter is separable from galaxies. “This discovery shows that dark matter is real – it has its own separate existence apart from other components of galaxies,” said van Dokkum.","NGC1052-DF2’s globular clusters and atypical structure has perplexed astronomers aiming to determine the conditions this galaxy formed under.","“It’s like you take a galaxy and you only have the stellar halo and globular clusters, and it somehow forgot to make everything else,” van Dokkum said. “There is no theory that predicted these types of galaxies. The galaxy is a complete mystery, as everything about it is strange. How you actually go about forming one of these things is completely unknown.”","However, researchers do have some ideas. NGC1052-DF2 resides about 65 million light years away in a collection of galaxies that is dominated by the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1052. Galaxy formation is turbulent and violent, and van Dokkum suggests that the growth of the fledgling massive galaxy billions of years ago perhaps played a role in NGC1052-DF2’s dark-matter deficiency.","Another idea is that a cataclysmic event within the oddball galaxy, such as the birth of myriad massive stars, swept out all the gas and dark matter, halting star formation.","These possibilities are speculative, however, and don’t explain all of the characteristics of the observed galaxy, the researchers add.","The team continues the hunt for more dark-matter-deficient galaxies. They are analyzing Hubble images of 23 other diffuse galaxies. Three of them appear to share similarities with NGC1052-DF2, which van Dokkum plans to follow up on in the coming months at Keck Observatory.","“Every galaxy we knew about before has dark matter, and they all fall in familiar categories like spiral or elliptical galaxies,” van Dokkum said. “But what would you get if there were no dark matter at all? Maybe this is what you would get.”","The W. M. Keck Observatory operates the largest, most scientifically productive telescopes on Earth.

The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.","Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","What kind of information was collected, and how was it acquired?","The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.","Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.","The technique had been developed at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.","Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.","Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge.","So was Facebook hacked?","Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.","But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.","Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","What is Facebook doing in response?","The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.","Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.”","What are others saying?","Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.","■ In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook’s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.","■ A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook’s ties to Cambridge Analytica.","■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post.

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Facebook has already testified about how its platform was used by Russian propagandists ahead of the 2016 election, but the company never put Zuckerberg himself in the spotlight with government leaders. The pressure may also foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network.","The company on Friday said that a professor used Facebook’s log-in tools to get people to sign up for what he claimed was a personality-analysis app he had designed for academic purposes. To take the quiz, 270,000 people gave the app permission to access data via Facebook on themselves and their friends, exposing a network of 50 million people, according to the New York Times. That kind of access was allowed per Facebook’s rules at the time. Afterward, the professor violated Facebook’s terms when he passed along that data to Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook found out about the breach in 2015, shut down the professor’s access and asked Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted the user data. Yet the social network on Friday suspended Cambridge from its system, explaining that it had learned the information wasn’t erased. Cambridge, originally funded by conservative political donor Robert Mercer, on Saturday denied that it still had access to the user data, and said it was working with Facebook on a solution.","A researcher who worked with the professor on the app is now currently an employee at Facebook, which is reviewing whether he knew about the data leak.","The denials and refutations did little to ease the criticism. Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Sunday that Zuckerberg or another senior executive should appear in front of his committee because previous witnesses have avoided difficult questions, creating “a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.’’","The next few weeks represent a critical time for Facebook to reassure users and regulators about its content standards and platform security, to prevent rules that could impact its main advertising business, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.","“Changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote in a note to investors.","Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to explain that the mishandling of user data was out of its hands and doesn’t constitute a “breach” – a definition that would require the company to alert users about whether their information was taken, per U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules.","Menlo Park, California-based Facebook no longer allows app developers to ask for access to data on users’ friends. But the improper handling of the data raises systemic questions about how much companies can be trusted to protect personal information, said Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology.","“While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways,” O’Connor said in a statement. “Communications technologies have become an essential part of our daily lives, but if we are unable to have control of our data, these technologies control us.

Obama was serving his first term as president. Google+ hadn’t arrived, let alone vanished again. Steve Jobs was still alive, as was Kim Jong Il. Facebook’s IPO hadn’t yet taken place, and its service was still fun to use—although it was littered with requests and demands from social games, like FarmVille and Pet Society.","I’d had enough of it—the click-farming games, for one, but also Facebook itself. Already in 2010, it felt like a malicious attention market where people treated friends as latent resources to be optimized. Compulsion rather than choice devoured people’s time. Apps like FarmVille sold relief for the artificial inconveniences they themselves had imposed.","In response, I made a satirical social game called Cow Clicker. Players clicked a cute cow, which mooed and scored a “click.” Six hours later, they could do so again. They could also invite friends’ cows to their pasture, buy virtual cows with real money, compete for status, click to send a real cow to the developing world from Oxfam, outsource clicks to their toddlers with a mobile app, and much more. It became strangely popular, until eventually, I shut the whole thing down in a bovine rapture—the “cowpocalypse.” It’s kind of a complicated story.","But one worth revisiting today, in the context of the scandal over Facebook’s sanctioning of user-data exfiltration via its application platform. It’s not just that abusing the Facebook platform for deliberately nefarious ends was easy to do (it was). But worse, in those days, it was hard to avoid extracting private data, for years even, without even trying. I did it with a silly cow game.","* * *","Cow Clicker is not an impressive work of software. After all, it was a game whose sole activity was clicking on cows. I wrote the principal code in three days, much of it hunched on a friend’s couch in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I had no idea anyone would play it, although over 180,000 people did, eventually. I made a little money from the whole affair, but I never optimized it for revenue generation. I certainly never pondered using the app as a lure for a data-extraction con. I was just a strange man making a strange game on a lark.","And yet, if you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior. I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood, before my caprice raptured them into the digital void.","The authorization dialog for the game Candy Crush. (King / Facebook)","To understand why withdrawing data was the default behavior in Facebook apps, you have to know something about how apps get made and published on Facebook. In 2007, the company turned its social-network service into an application platform. The idea was that Facebook could grow its number of users and the time they spent engaged by allowing people and organizations to build services overtop of it. And those people and organizations would benefit by plugging into a large network of users, whose network of friends could easily be made a part of the service, both for social interaction and viral spread.","When you access an app on Facebook’s website, be it a personality-quiz, a game, a horoscope, or a sports community, the service presents you with an authorization dialog, where the specific data an app says it needs is displayed for the user’s consideration. That could be anything from your name, friend list, and email address, to your photos, likes, direct messages and more.","The information shared with an app by default has changed over time, and even a savvy user might never have known what comprised it. When I launched Cow Clicker in 2010, it was easier to acquire both “basic” information (name, gender, networks, and profile picture) and “extended” user information (location, relationship status, likes, posts, and more). In 2014, Facebook began an app review process for information beyond that which a user shared publicly, but for years before that, the decision was left to the user alone. This is consistent with Facebook’s longstanding, official policy on privacy, which revolves around user control rather than procedural verification.","App authorizations are not exceptionally clear. For one thing, the user must accept the app’s request to share data with it as soon as they open it for the first time, even before knowing what the app does or why. For another, the authorization is presented by Facebook, not by the third party, making it seem official, safe, and even endorsed.","Cow Clicker on Facebook, 2010. The game appears to live natively inside the Facebook interface, but it runs—and stores its data—on a separate server. (Cow Clicker / Ian Bogost / The Atlantic)","The part of the Facebook website where apps appear, under the blue top navigation (as seen above), introduces further confusion. To the average web user, especially a decade ago, it looked like the game or app was just a part of Facebook itself. The page is seamless, with no boundary between the site’s navigational chrome and the third-party app. If you look at the browser address bar while using a Facebook app on the website, the URL begins with “apps.facebook.com,” further cementing the impression that the user was safely ensconced in the comforting, blue cradle of Facebook’s care.","That’s not what really takes place. When a user loads an app, Facebook’s servers pass those requests to a remote computer, where the individual or company that made the app hosts their services. The app sends its responses to Facebook, which formats and presents them to the user, as if they were inside of Facebook itself.","The authorization process happens once, the first time the app is accessed for a specific user. After that, every time the user loads the app, Facebook sends it a payload of basic user data to facilitate the app’s operation (additional data can be requested separately when needed). For years, these transmissions were even conducted unencrypted, until Facebook required apps to communicate with its service over a secure connection.","Beyond its own terms of service for applications, which many developers probably didn’t read or feel compelled to heed, Facebook “secured” user data shared with third-parties by requiring every app to publish a privacy policy. Because data sharing was seen as a form of user-control, not corporate policy, Facebook doesn’t appear to review platform-developer privacy policies. As far as I can tell, all the platform did was to insure that accessing the URL for an app’s privacy policy didn’t result in a page-not-found error. Facebook was checking that privacy policies existed as reachable web pages, not that they existed as privacy policies, let alone policies that provided any specific protections. And besides, users probably never read the policies, which were linked unassumingly from the application-permissions interface. They might easily, and reasonably, have assumed that Facebook was simply reiterating its own privacy policy when presenting new access to an app. They would have been wrong.","In essence, Facebook was presenting apps as quasi-endorsed extensions of its core service to users who couldn’t have been expected to know better. That might explain why so many people feel violated by Facebook this week—they might never have realized that they were even using foreign, non-Facebook applications in the first place, let alone ones that were siphoning off and selling their data. The website always just looked like Facebook.","In the case of Cow Clicker, which only ever aimed to let people click on pictures of cows, I was able to access two potentially sensitive pieces of data without even trying.","The first is a player’s Facebook ID. This is a numeric, unique identifier attached to every Facebook account. Once I have your Facebook ID, I can look up your profile programmatically, or I can just load it in the public website by appending it to “facebook.com”—Mark Zuckerberg’s is 4.","These days, Facebook generates a unique, app-specific ID for each user, in order to prevent an app from connecting someone directly to Facebook profiles. But back in Cow Clicker’s heyday of 2010, Facebook didn’t do this, and every app got your actual ID. Those data could be correlated against other information—data collected from Facebook, fashioned by the app, or acquired elsewhere. Because I collected and stored my users’ true Facebook IDs to be able to count their clicks and build their pastures and the like, I still have them, and, in theory, I could use them nefariously. A 2014 terms-of-service update prohibits some of that activity, but not everyone cares about violating the Facebook terms of service.","The second type of information is a piece of profile data Cow Clicker received without asking for it. Back in 2010, Facebook still allowed users to join “networks”—affiliations like schools, workplaces, and organizations. In some cases, those affiliations required authorization, for example having an email address at a domain that corresponds with a university. Over time, verification became less important to Facebook, and now users can affiliate with schools or workplaces arbitrarily. The less friction, the more data.","In 2010, on my friend’s couch in Brooklyn, I noticed that Facebook was shipping user affiliation data over the wire to me, so I decided to store it. Facebook allowed apps to store data for which user permission was granted, but urged developers not to request or store more than it needed to operate. Putting affiliation data in the Cow Clicker database allowed me to provide leaderboard rankings by network, allowing my players to compete for clicks with their work colleagues or classmates.","That’s neither a terribly interesting feature nor a particularly wicked one. But because I stored the numerical identifiers for user affiliations, I still have them. Until 2016, I could use a database-query tool called FQL, Facebook Query Language, to retrieve the details of those networks, and correlate them back to my users. Had I wanted to, I could have recombined that information with other data and used it for retargeting.","Cow Clicker’s example is so modest, it might not even seem like a problem. What does it matter if a simple diversion has your Facebook ID, education, and work affiliations? Especially since its solo creator (that’s me) was too dumb or too lazy to exploit that data toward pernicious ends. But even if I hadn’t thought about it at the time, I could have done so years later, long after the cows vanished, and once Cow Clicker players forgot that they’d ever installed my app.","This is also why Zuckerberg’s response to the present controversy feels so toothless. Facebook has vowed to audit companies that have collected, shared, or sold large volumes of data in violation of its policy, but the company cannot close the Pandora’s box it opened a decade ago, when it first allowed external apps to collect Facebook user data. That information is now in the hands of thousands, maybe millions of people.","To be honest, I’m not even sure I know what the Facebook platform’s terms of service dictated that I do with user data acquired from Facebook. Technically, users could revoke certain app permissions later, and apps were supposed to remove any impacted data that they had stored. I doubt most apps did that, and I suspect users never knew—and still don’t know—that revoking access to an app they used eight years ago doesn’t do anything to reverse transmissions that took place years ago.","As Jason Koebler put it at Motherboard, it’s too late. “If your data has already been taken, Facebook has no mechanism and no power to make people delete it. If your data was taken, it has very likely been sold, laundered, and put back into Facebook.” Indeed, all the publicity around Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica crisis might be sending lots of old app developers, like me, back to old code and dusty databases, wondering what they’ve even got stored and what it might yet be worth.","Facebook’s laissez-faire openness surely contributed to the data-extraction free-for-all that’s playing itself out now via the example of Cambridge Analytica. But so did its move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development. The Facebook platform was truly a nightmare to use and to maintain. It was built like no other software system then extant, and it changed constantly—regular updates rolled out weekly. Old code broke, seemingly for no good reason. Some Facebook app developers were dishonest from the start, and others couldn’t help themselves once they saw the enormous volume of data they could slurp from millions or tens of millions of Facebook users. But many more were just struggling to eke out a part of their living in an ecosystem where people might discover them.","Millions of apps had been created by 2012, when I hung up my cowboy hat. Not only apps apparently designed with duplicity in mind, like Aleksandr Kogan’s personality-quiz, which extracted data that was then sold to Cambridge Analytica. But hundreds of thousands of creators of dumb toys, quizzes, games, and communities that might never have intended to dupe or violate users surely did so anyway, because Facebook rammed their data down our throats. On the whole, none of us asked for your data. But we have it anyway, and forever.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

The firm connected with Trump's political adviser Steve Bannon, whom Wylie also met, the reports said.","Wylie, a 28-year-old from British Columbia, is the data scientist who spoke out about controversy. He's also the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica.","“I do feel responsible for it and it's something that I regret,” Wylie said in a video interview posted on The Observer's web page.","“It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country, without their consent or awareness.”","The reports provided many details about whistleblower who in 2007 or 2008 landed his first political gig with the federal Liberals.","At age 17, he worked in the office of Canada's opposition leader, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion, said one of the reports. When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama's campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn't heard of Wylie - or they barely remembered him.","“I vaguely recall him,” wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. “I think that he was a summer intern.”","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was “pretty junior” and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn't know Wylie well, they remembered him as a “big advocate of microtargetting.”","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama's campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ. The firm has come under scrutiny in Britain for its possible role in helping the Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum.","Asked about Wylie, Canada's Liberal Party said in a statement Sunday that protecting the information of Canadians it engages with is a “foremost priority.”","The party said it has a clear, stringent policy that protects individuals' private information. It also said its agreements with campaign partners also include strict requirements.","The party insists it doesn't sell information under any circumstances.","A spokeswoman for Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said Sunday that social-media platforms have a responsibility to help ensure citizens and the democratic processes are protected from “threats like foreign interference, data breaches, hate speech, and misinformation.”","“While some social-media platforms have begun to take initial steps to address these issues, it's clear that much more needs to be done,” Jordan Owens wrote in an email.","Owens said the government would work with social-media firms to ensure they respect and help preserve the integrity of Canada's democracy.","Facebook said in a weekend blog post that claims the harvesting of user information was a data breach are “completely false.”","The statement said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his Facebook app.","“People knowingly gave their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” said the post by Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice-president and deputy general counsel."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Nonetheless, it underscores a key concern of both Facebook and its investors: how to keep people from deleting their accounts over what many see as a betrayal of customers' trust.","Related Stories","The new Privacy Shortcuts menu, being rolled out in the coming weeks, will let people regulate the amount of personal information the social media giant keeps on them, like political preferences and interests, and delete things they've already shared. It will also let people manage the information the company uses to show ads.","Facebook has come under increasing pressure from Europe and the U.S. to address revelations that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with Donald Trump's presidential campaign, harvested data from about 50 million Facebook users as it built an election-consulting company that boasted it could sway voters in contests all over the world.","It has plunged Facebook into one of its worst crises of confidence in years. The stock has fallen 18 percent since the news was first revealed by the New York Times and The Observer of London earlier this month, wiping out almost $100 billion of market value. Facebook is no longer among the top five most valuable companies in the world and it delayed unveiling a new home speaker product to reevaluate how it uses data, according to people familiar with the matter.

{"originalurl":"http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/cambridge-analytica-chris-wylie-eunoia-trump-campaign","title":"The Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower Wanted His New Company To Work With Trump Campaign’s Manager","text":["Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica cofounder who recently blew the whistle on the political consulting firm’s improper procurement of the personal data of millions of Facebook users, had the same data set when he was establishing a business of his own in 2014, according to information obtained by BuzzFeed News. The following year, that company, Eunoia Technologies, subsequently pitched Republican political operative Corey Lewandowski on microtargeting tools that could be deployed on behalf of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Emails from 2014 provided to BuzzFeed News show that Eunoia possessed a database of more than 50 million Facebook profiles at the time. That same information — and Facebook’s wider data collection policies in general — are now being scrutinized following reports by the New York Times and the Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired it from a company called Global Science Research (GSR), which originally collected it for academic purposes.","GSR, Cambridge Analytica, and Wylie said they have since deleted the data. Cambridge Analytica, which Donald Trump’s presidential campaign employed throughout 2016 to build ad-targeting profiles on potential voters, claimed in a statement Friday that none of the Facebook information in question was used for the election. And while there is no current indication Eunoia used the database or pitched it to Lewandowski, the fact that Wylie's little-known startup — which was a wholly distinct entity from Cambridge Analytica — possessed it at all is the latest in a string of revelations in Facebook's data crisis and further evidence that the company is unable to track how the personal profile information it collects is employed and distributed by third parties.","Other documents from Eunoia, which marketed ad microtargeting services to corporate and political clients, reveal that in the spring of 2015 Wylie’s startup pitched elections-related work to Trump’s eventual campaign manager, Lewandowski. One source, who declined to be named for fear of endangering personal and business relationships confirmed the authenticity of these documents; another person, who had direct knowledge of Eunoia’s meeting with Lewandowski, confirmed the Wylie-led startup’s interest in working for the fledgling Trump campaign.","Since blowing the whistle on Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, Wylie has said very little about Eunoia and his aspirations for it. He also has not spoken at all about his startup’s meeting with Lewandowski, who would go on to lead the Trump campaign. In response to BuzzFeed News’ questions about Eunoia last week, Wylie’s lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that her client “has not worked for Republican clients since leaving [Cambridge Analytica]” and that his company had “no data or assets.”","“Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets.”","The documents obtained by BuzzFeed and subsequent interviews with sources do not always cast Wylie in a flattering light, but they also do not call into question his claims about the improper transfer of Facebook user data to political consulting entities. After responding to an initial request for comment, Wylie's attorney went dark and did not answer the questions BuzzFeed News put to her Tuesday.","In a four-hour hearing of the UK Commons select committee on digital culture, media, and sport on Tuesday, Wylie was asked by committee chair Damian Collins if he had benefited from the GSR data set on other projects that he’d worked on outside of Cambridge Analytica.","“I didn’t do any contracts or do any, you know, work with that data,” Wylie replied. “I haven’t worked with any clients … That data got deleted, I believe, in 2015 on my end.”","“SCL Without Alexander Nix”","Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Wylie discussed plans to “build the NSA’s wet dream” in late 2013 while still working at Cambridge Analytica. “Our goal is first to make it an extremely profitable company,” he wrote in late 2013. “Then we will cleanse our souls with other projects, like using the data for good rather than evil. But evil pays more.\"","According to two people who knew Wylie at this time, the SCL microtargeting specialist had approached a number of colleagues about leaving their jobs to join him in a new company. According to one person, Wylie hoped to model his firm after Palantir Technologies, the CIA-backed, Silicon Valley data-mining company.","“He was very much trying to build this company and his vision was, ‘I want to build SCL without [Cambridge Analytica CEO] Alexander Nix,’” said one person who talked to Wylie about his new venture. Last week, Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix pending an investigation after he was recorded by the UK’s Channel 4 touting his firm’s ability to influence foreign elections and discussing techniques to entrap and blackmail political candidates. Cambridge Analytica did not return a request for comment.","By the beginning of 2014, Wylie had put together a presentation for a company called Arg.us. According to its pitch deck, which was seen and published in part by BuzzFeed News, the company said it could ingest users' social media activity to build “psychographic” profiles for marketers who could then target ads to specific users and possibly influence behavior. By the winter of that year, Wylie was having conversations about his idea with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including one who spoke to BuzzFeed News and received a note that said the products that Wylie had promised had been used for previous political clients.","Wylie’s lawyer previously said that Arg.us presentation was “never a serious pitch,” and it’s not clear how it was used. That said, similarities in documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News suggest it was a precursor to Eunoia.","After leaving Cambridge Analytica and SCL in late June of 2014, Wylie pivoted his focus to Eunoia — Greek for “beautiful thinking” — formulating a company that could perform so-called psychographic modeling and targeting for its clients. By August, he was working at Eunoia with Tobias Kloepper, a one-time SCL data scientist who would obtain Facebook data for the young startup. Emails viewed by BuzzFeed News indicate that Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist and founder of GSR, shared a database of more than 50 million Facebook users with Kloepper.","Kogan and Kloepper did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unclear if Wylie ever used that data, with the whistleblower noting in front of a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that he eventually deleted it because “I wasn’t going to do anything with it.”","Correspondence between Wylie and an acquaintance from September 2014 show that, while Wylie was particularly interested in courting fashion industry clients, he claimed to also have meetings with Monsanto, the American Petroleum Institute, and Ford. A Eunoia fashion-focused presentation from the time obtained by BuzzFeed News said the company had a “database that contains the information of hundreds of millions of individual consumers with emails, Facebook/Twitter IDs and mailing addresses,” while a separate company brochure specifically discusses targeting voters for potential political clients. Neither document mentions the specific GSR data set of 50 million Facebook users, and it’s unclear if Eunoia ever put that data to use.","“The heart of our work stems from a rigorous scientific understanding of human behavior, which in turn allows us to engineer more responsive audiences and engage consumers more precisely,” read the brochure. “To do this, we have developed a series of algorithms that can predict the personality traits of individual voters by analyzing their voterfile [sic], social, online and consumer data.”","Neither the presentation nor the brochure mention the provenance of that \"social, online and consumer data.\"","Provided to BuzzFeed News","A presentation slide for fashion clients from Eunoia Technologies.","According to one person, GSR gave its data to Eunoia after Kogan had negotiated an agreement where the startup would receive the information without charge as part of a data-sharing agreement between the two parties. Wylie never provided Kogan with data of his own, this person said, and GSR moved to cancel its agreements with Eunoia in early 2015. Eunoia appears to never have officially launched; a separate source told BuzzFeed News that it was unable to secure funding.","Data On The Loose","The contested data set, which GSR harvested using a 2014 Facebook personality quiz where users permitted the app to obtain personal information about themselves and their friends, has kick-started investigations from governments around the world. In the US, multiple members of Congress have asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill about the social network’s data policies and how the information of more than 50 million users could have ended up in the hands of a company doing elections consulting work.","As BuzzFeed News has learned, the spread of the Facebook data was not confined to Cambridge Analytica. Wylie may have had access to the data set for more than a year after founding Eunoia, with Facebook only acting to address the violation of its rules in late 2015, after the release of a story in the Guardian. GSR was told to delete its data in December 2015, according to a source, while Wylie said in testimony in front a parliamentary committee Tuesday that he believed he deleted the GSR data “some time in 2015” after being contacted by Kogan.","Earlier this month, after learning that several outlets were working on stories about the Trump campaign–hired data analysis company, the social networking giant moved to suspend the Facebook accounts of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, and Wylie. Facebook declined to comment for this story.","\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post last Wednesday. He added that the company would investigate “all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014.” The company took out full-page ads in several newspapers last Sunday apologizing for the mistake.","Asked last week if Eunoia had used any data sets on Facebook users, Wylie’s lawyer, Allen, was adamant. “Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets,” she wrote.","Provided to BuzzFeed News","Eunoia business cards","Eunoia And Trump’s Campaign Manager","In an interview with NBC’s Today show last week, Wylie drew a line between Cambridge Analytica and Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “What I do know is that Cambridge Analytica was meeting with Corey Lewandowski in 2015 before Trump had even announced and offering the services that I’m talking about right now,” he said.","What Wylie didn’t say is that Eunoia Technologies also met with Lewandowski around the same time. According to one source, Lewandowski met with representatives of the company, including Tadas Jucikas, a former SCL employee, and Mark Gettleson, Eunoia’s communications and marketing strategist, around Easter Sunday 2015 in the lobby of a New York Central Park hotel. Wylie did not attend the meeting, said the person, but he was well aware of it and its purpose to discuss voter microtargeting for a possible presidential candidate.","Drew Angerer / Getty Images","Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski arrives at Trump Tower in December 2016 in New York City.","While Trump’s campaign went on to work with Cambridge Analytica later in 2016, the person said that Lewandowski met with Eunoia, in part, because the Alexander Nix operation was already working for Ted Cruz’s presidential election team at the time. According to that source, that meeting included “high-level discussions” about microtargeting techniques and did not include any talk about Facebook data.","Jucikas declined to comment. Gettleson did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including phone calls, emails, and a visit to his London home. Lewandowski, who became Trump’s official campaign manager when the billionaire announced his candidacy in June 2015, did not respond to a request for comment.","Emails obtained by BuzzFeed News further corroborate the pitch to the Trump campaign. In April 2015, following the meeting with Lewandowski, Gettleson, a political operative with UK’s liberal democratic party, sent an email with the subject line “Trump” to a graphic designer who had been designing business cards and brochures for the company. The email included an attachment labeled “Trump-Handout,” which contained a list of various political microtargeting products and services offered by the company. The graphic designer made a few adjustments to the document and placed its contents on official Eunoia stationery before sending it back to Gettleson in a PDF called “eunioa_stationary_introletter.” It’s unclear if these documents were then sent to Lewandowski or if Eunoia had any further meetings with Trump’s eventual campaign manager.","A cache of documents sent to BuzzFeed News by a source, which included business contracts and pitch decks, reveal other individuals who, to varying degrees, were associated with the fledgling startup. Many of those people did not want to talk about their involvement with the company or did not return BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment. Ray Larson, a former strategist for Canada’s liberal party, did not respond to emails and a phone message; Brent Clickard, a former colleague of Wylie’s at SCL declined to comment. A source close to Clickard said that while he spoke with Wylie about working at Eunoia, the pair never formalized an agreement.","Alfredas Chmieliauskas, a London-based employee of Palantir, said he had “no idea” why his name was on Eunoia’s business documents, adding that while Wylie knew “a former school friend of mine ... we never had a working relationship of any sort.” On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Chmieliauskas, while at Palantir, began corresponding with Wylie in 2013 and later gave him the idea to develop the quiz app, eventually employed by Kogan, to harvest Facebook user data. Wylie also visited with Palantir, with a company spokesperson later confirming that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica considered working together at one point.","Correspondence from Wylie that was given to BuzzFeed News show Wylie bragging to an acquaintance in late 2013 about the prospect of someone from Palantir wanting to join his idea for a startup.","It is not clear if these people, who denied having official work relationships with Eunoia or did not reply altogether, knew that the company had access to a data set with more than 50 million Facebook users or that its associates were meeting with potential presidential campaigns.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record.\"","According to a source, Eunoia also sought to hire Mark Block, the former chief of staff to 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain who had a brief spell of notoriety for smoking a cigarette in a campaign ad. Block’s name and that of his associate, Linda Hansen, were printed on a proof sheet of draft Eunoia business cards given to BuzzFeed News by a second source.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record,” Block said when asked about his relationship with Eunoia and Wylie. Block, who reportedly introduced Steve Bannon to SCL and worked for the company’s elections division as its head of US sales, according to an archived version of SCL’s website, declined to say anything more.","\"There were discussions about politics and some other ex [Cambridge Analytica] staff wanted to continue working in Republican politics,\" Wylie's lawyer said in an email to earlier questions last week. \"However they parted ways with Mr Wylie to set up their own company that does work for Republican clients. ...

J Cromack, chief commercial officer at Consentric, advises organisations how to navigate the current crisis of confidence,","It’s concerning to see companies still treating people’s personal data as a tradeable commodity – something they can use however they like and sell on for a handsome profit. But all that is about to end.","Many consumers have until now turned a blind eye to routine data collection – largely accepting it as part of the deal for having convenient and often free online services. But Cambridge Analytica’s activities and Facebook’s responsibility and subsequent response[1] have brought matters to a tipping point[2]. Online service providers are going to have to work hard to win back trust.","Data custodianship is a privilege","Meanwhile there are just weeks to go until the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes enforceable, bringing data-privacy controls and organisational obligations up-to-date with the digital era. It still comes as a surprise to many companies to learn that the data they have collected is not their property. But now they will have to learn fast that they are merely custodians of that information – with a duty to use it circumspectly[3].","GDPR should be used by companies as an excuse to kick-start something new: being honest and transparent with people about data intentions; and having a holistic strategy and approach to customer data that transcends individual systems – and which is easily auditable.","Where organisations are seen to use people’s data respectfully, with permission, in ways that provide tangible benefits to an individual – such as more direct access to what interests them and personalised promotions – consumers are much more likely to opt-in.","What is changing","Under GDPR, every organisation that captures customer data – from internet giants to banks and retailers, to local authorities, health services and charities – has an obligation to be transparent about the personal data it is collecting. It must seek permission for each specific use case, take appropriate steps to safeguard that data and ensure it is not shared beyond the parameters the customer has knowingly agreed to.","This is nothing new; these principles were enshrined in the existing Data Protection Act[4]. But until now there has been too much emphasis on consumers reading the small print and taking proactive steps to protect themselves. Under GDPR, and certainly in the aftermath of the CA/Facebook breach of public trust, accountability will shift back to the organisations collecting, storing and using people’s data. They already face an uphill struggle; the latest figures from the Information Commissioner’s Office suggest that across the UK as a whole only a fifth of people have trust and confidence in companies and organisations storing their personal information[5].","Reframing GDPR compliance as a priority for consumer trust","All this means, once and for all, that use and safeguarding of people’s personal data has ceased to be something that directors can palm off to compliance/governance and IT departments. It is central to organisations’ relationship with their customers, to how they are perceived in the market, to whether they will succeed or fail. At best, the way that companies and service providers manage and communicate about their handling of customer data will become a brand differentiator; as a minimum it will be a condition of engagement.","In this light, GDPR compliance takes on a different meaning. Suddenly it is less about how permissions are worded at each customer touch-point or the individual security requirements applied to each IT system and cloud application. Instead it is about being open and honest and true to the principles of data protection.","In time, this should also be something that customers themselves can have some control over (by being able to more easily review and edit their data permissions, for example). A new survey by Boston Consulting Group found that people were much more likely to willingly share their data if they felt confident that harmful use would be prevented[6].","Avoiding ever decreasing circles","Above all, what the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook story demonstrates most is that it is not the regulatory authorities that companies need to fear, it is the customers who will vote with their clicks and swipes about where they feel comfortable leaving their digital footprint.","If customers fear they are living out Dave Egger’s book The Circle – and are driven off the grid where they can’t be tracked – no one wins. Organisations need to be seen to be using data with respect, not in ways that create suspicion and mistrust, causing customers to untick all the boxes, refuse cookies and shroud themselves in anonymity."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The women were far and away the single demographic group most likely to hand over cash, for a chance to dine in Hollywood with Clooney — and Obama.","So as they did with all the other data collected, stored and analyzed in the two-year drive for re-election, Obama’s top campaign aides decided to put this insight to use. They sought out an East Coast celebrity who had similar appeal among the same demographic, aiming to replicate the millions of dollars produced by the Clooney contest. “We were blessed with an overflowing menu of options, but we chose Sarah Jessica Parker,” explains a senior campaign adviser. And so the next Dinner with Barack contest was born: a chance to eat at Parker’s West Village brownstone.","For the general public, there was no way to know that the idea for the Parker contest had come from a data-mining discovery about some supporters: affection for contests, small dinners and celebrity. But from the beginning, campaign manager Jim Messina had promised a totally different, metric-driven kind of campaign in which politics was the goal but political instincts might not be the means. “We are going to measure every single thing in this campaign,” he said after taking the job. He hired an analytics department five times as large as that of the 2008 operation, with an official “chief scientist” for the Chicago headquarters named Rayid Ghani, who in a previous life crunched huge data sets to, among other things, maximize the efficiency of supermarket sales promotions.","Exactly what that team of dozens of data crunchers was doing, however, was a closely held secret. “They are our nuclear codes,” campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt would say when asked about the efforts. Around the office, data-mining experiments were given mysterious code names such as Narwhal and Dreamcatcher. The team even worked at a remove from the rest of the campaign staff, setting up shop in a windowless room at the north end of the vast headquarters office. The “scientists” created regular briefings on their work for the President and top aides in the White House’s Roosevelt Room, but public details were in short supply as the campaign guarded what it believed to be its biggest institutional advantage over Mitt Romney’s campaign: its data.","On Nov. 4, a group of senior campaign advisers agreed to describe their cutting-edge efforts with TIME on the condition that they not be named and that the information not be published until after the winner was declared. What they revealed as they pulled back the curtain was a massive data effort that helped Obama raise $1 billion, remade the process of targeting TV ads and created detailed models of swing-state voters that could be used to increase the effectiveness of everything from phone calls and door knocks to direct mailings and social media.","How to Raise $1 Billion\nFor all the praise Obama’s team won in 2008 for its high-tech wizardry, its success masked a huge weakness: too many databases. Back then, volunteers making phone calls through the Obama website were working off lists that differed from the lists used by callers in the campaign office. Get-out-the-vote lists were never reconciled with fundraising lists. It was like the FBI and the CIA before 9/11: the two camps never shared data. “We analyzed very early that the problem in Democratic politics was you had databases all over the place,” said one of the officials. “None of them talked to each other.” So over the first 18 months, the campaign started over, creating a single massive system that could merge the information collected from pollsters, fundraisers, field workers and consumer databases as well as social-media and mobile contacts with the main Democratic voter files in the swing states.","The new megafile didn’t just tell the campaign how to find voters and get their attention; it also allowed the number crunchers to run tests predicting which types of people would be persuaded by certain kinds of appeals. Call lists in field offices, for instance, didn’t just list names and numbers; they also ranked names in order of their persuadability, with the campaign’s most important priorities first. About 75% of the determining factors were basics like age, sex, race, neighborhood and voting record. Consumer data about voters helped round out the picture. “We could [predict] people who were going to give online. We could model people who were going to give through mail. We could model volunteers,” said one of the senior advisers about the predictive profiles built by the data. “In the end, modeling became something way bigger for us in ’12 than in ’08 because it made our time more efficient.”","Early on, for example, the campaign discovered that people who had unsubscribed from the 2008 campaign e-mail lists were top targets, among the easiest to pull back into the fold with some personal attention. The strategists fashioned tests for specific demographic groups, trying out message scripts that they could then apply. They tested how much better a call from a local volunteer would do than a call from a volunteer from a non–swing state like California. As Messina had promised, assumptions were rarely left in place without numbers to back them up."],"isopubdate":""}

Readers with long memories will recall him as the guy who ran the “White House Plumbers” during the presidency of Richard Nixon. Liddy directed the Watergate burglary in June 1972, detection of which started the long chain of events that eventually led to Nixon’s resignation two years later. For his pains, Liddy spent more than four years in jail, but went on to build a second career as a talk-show host and D-list celebrity. Reflecting on this, one wonders what job opportunities – other than those of pantomime villain and Savile Row mannequin – will now be available to Mr Nix.","The investigations into the company by Carole Cadwalladr, in the Observer, reveal that in every respect save one important one, CA looks like a standard-issue psychological warfare outfit of the kind retained by political parties – and sometimes national security services – since time immemorial. It did, however, have one unique selling proposition, namely its ability to offer “psychographic” services: voter-targeting strategies allegedly derived by analysing the personal data of more than 50 million US users of Facebook.","The story of how those data made the journey from Facebook’s servers to Cambridge Analytica’s is now widely known. But it is also widely misunderstood. (Many people were puzzled, for example, by Facebook’s vehement insistence that the exfiltration of a huge trove of users’ data was not a “breach”.) The shorthand version of what happened – that “a slug of Facebook data on 50 million Americans was sucked down by a UK academic named Aleksandr Kogan, and wrongly sold to Cambridge Analytica” – misses an important point, which is that in acquiring the data in the first place Kogan was acting with Facebook’s full knowledge and approval.","In 2013, he wrote an app called “Thisisyourdigitallife” which offered users an online personality test, describing itself as “a research app used by psychologists”. Approximately 270,000 people downloaded it and in doing so gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it. This drew more than 50 million unsuspecting Facebook users into Kogan’s net.","Profile","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica","Nix worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman.","Controversies","Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison","Photograph: The Washington Post","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The key point is that all of this was allowed by the terms and conditions under which he was operating. Thousands of other Facebook apps were also operating under similar T&Cs – and had been since 2007, when the company turned its social networking service into an application platform.","So Kogan was only a bit player in the data-hoovering game: apps such as the insanely popular Candy Crush, for example, were also able to collect players’ public profiles, friends lists and email addresses. And Facebook seemed blissfully indifferent to this open door because it was central to its commercial strategy: the more apps there were on its platform the more powerful the network effects would be and the more personal data there would be to monetise.","That’s why the bigger story behind the current controversy is the fact that what Cambridge Analytica claimed to have accomplished would not have been possible without Facebook. Which means that, in the end, Facebook poses the problem that democracies will have to solve.","In that context, the firm’s response to the crisis has been instructive. The first stage was denial: there was no “data breach”; then there were legal threats and the heavy artillery of expensive law firms; after that we were treated to ludicrous attempts to portray a giant global corporation as an innocent victim of wicked people who did terrible things behind its back.","And then, finally – after an extended bout of corporate panic at its Californian HQ as the share price tanked – there was a return to euphemistic form as the boy wonder CEO came out from under the duvet wearing his signature grey T-shirt. He was in his sorrowful-but-resolute mode: “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” he wrote. “But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that. In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way. But there’s more we need to do … ”","If that sounds familiar, then that’s because it is. TechCrunch listed 11 separate controversies that resulted from Facebook being caught taking liberties with users’ data or trust. In most of these cases, the Zuckerberg response has been the same: sorrowful contrition followed by requests for forgiveness, topped off with resolutions to do better in future. The lad is beginning to sound like an alcoholic who, after his latest bout of drink-related excess, says sorry and expresses his determination to reform.","The trouble is that, as the veteran tech investor Om Malik pointed out this week, Facebook can’t reform without changing its very nature. “Facebook’s DNA,” he writes, “is that of a social platform addicted to growth and engagement. At its very core, every policy, every decision, every strategy is based on growth (at any cost) and engagement (at any cost). More growth and more engagement means more data – which means the company can make more advertising dollars, which gives it a nosebleed valuation on the stock market, which in turn allows it to remain competitive and stay ahead of its rivals.”","No amount of corporate spin can disguise that central truth. Facebook’s core business is exploiting the personal data of its users. That is its essence. So expecting it to wean itself off that exploitation is like trying to persuade ExxonMobil that it should get out of the oil and gas business.","That’s why the central question about the Cambridge Analytica controversy is whether it’s a scandal or a crisis. Scandals create a lot of noise and heat, but nothing much changes as a result. Crises are what lead to fundamental change. Facebook’s response – and its corporate DNA – suggest that it’s just a scandal. So stay tuned for the next data breach."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

Today the company announced that it will build four additional data centers at its cloud campus in Papillion, Nebraska, for a total of six buildings and more than 2.6 million square feet of space to house servers and storage.","The expansion in Nebraska continues a trend in which Facebook is super-sizing the scale of Internet infrastructure, building bigger data centers, and larger cloud campuses. We first reported on last February, and the company’s construction program has accelerating relentlessly ever since.","Since the beginning of 2017, Facebook has announced five new cloud campuses. The social network now has 12 data center campuses around the globe, including nine in the U.S. and three in international markets. Facebook has nearly 15 million square feet of data center space completed or under construction, with several million more feet in the planning stages.","Each of these cloud campuses features enough land to build at least three data centers, and sometimes as many as six. Each data center is approximately 1,000 feet long, and includes multiple data halls, each of which houses tens of thousands of servers that process and store the status updates, photos and videos that are shared by Facebook users.","OCP Summit 2018 on Tap","As it creates its huge global network, Facebook is helping change the way data centers are built, and the equipment that fills them. Facebook shares its data center and IT design innovations publicly through the Open Compute Project (OCP), which it helped found in 2011 to accelerate the open hardware movement. The group has helped the principles of open source software movement be more widely adoptedin IT hardware, particularly among the largest “hyperscale” computing providers.","The OCP community will gather again this week in San Jose for the Open Compute Summit, where we can expect to see new innovations in data center hardware from Facebook and its partners. In 2017, Facebook shared updated designs for its Big Basin AI server and high-density Bryce Canyon storage unit.","Facebook has been scaling up its infrastructure to handle massive growth in user photo uploads, including custom cold storage facilities and the use of BluRay disks to save energy on long-term storage. Video storage can be an even larger and more expensive storage challenge, as HD video files are substantially larger than photos. This has infrastructure implications. VR and 360-degree video applications require a LOT of data, and delivering these experiences across the Internet presents a major challenge. Virtual reality content could be 5 to 20 times the size of today’s full HD video.","Getting Greener as it Grows","That’s why Facebook is building bigger cloud campuses. As it expands its Nebraska campus, Facebook is also sourcing additional renewable energy, which has become a key component of its data center projects.","Last year Facebook worked with the Omaha Public Power District to create a new renewable energy tariff that allowed it to procure power from Enel Green Power’s Rattlesnake Creek Wind Project. As it adds data centers, it is expanding its power purchases.","“We will now increase our purchase from 200 MW to 320 MW to support our growth,” said Jim Piazza, Director of Data Center Operations, East. “We are excited to share that we have partnered with Adobe to help them enter the U.S. renewable energy market with Enel; 10 MW of Rattlesnake Creek will be allocated to Adobe.”","Free Resource from Data Center Frontier White Paper Library","A new ebook from CoreSite introduces readers to a solution many enterprises are adopting – direct interconnect to cloud providers within a colocation facility. Download the new report to learn more about the potential cost and performance advantages this option for streamlining hybrid IT connectivity can create.","Data center hubs offer economies of scale, enabling companies to rapidly add server capacity and electric power as more workloads shift from in-house IT rooms into these massive server farms. Huge regional campuses allow cloud builders to address their toughest challenge: capacity planning. With demand for cloud services growing rapidly, it’s difficult to accurately predict how much data center space will be needed, and how soon.","Here’s a look at Facebook’s rapidly growing data center campuses around the world:","Prineville, Oregon: Facebook began work on its first site in Prineville in 2010, and has now completed three huge data centers, with two more in the works). The expansion project will give Facebook 2.15 million square feet of data center space in Prineville by 2021. The Oregon campus is where Facebook debuted its cold storage data center, a web-scale implementation of tiered storage that shifts older media in a lower-cost environment. Prineville also houses Facebook’s Mobile Device Lab, which it uses to test-drive revisions to its applications across up to 2,000 different types of smartphones.","Rutherford County, N.C.: The company’s 160-acre cloud campus in Forest City, North Carolina houses two major data centers, with a third in the construction phase, as well as three smaller cold data storage facilities. Forest City is located in an isothermal belt along the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge mountains, which provides a constant temperature.","Altoona, Iowa: The Altoona data center will soon reach 2.5 million square feet of data center space. The campus features three data centers between 468,000 SF and 496,000 SF. In 2016 the company added a 100,000 SF cold storage facility, and has recently began work on a fourth data center . Facebook has contracted for about 140 megawatts of power in a long-term power purchase agreement with a nearby Wellsburg, Iowa wind farm.","Lulea, Sweden: This data center campus marked the first expansion of Facebook’s infrastructure beyond the United States. For this project, Facebook was able to reduce the number of backup generators by 70 percent, as the extraordinary reliability of the regional power grid serving the town of Lulea allows the company to use fewer generators than in its U.S. facilities. The site is backed by locally generated hydro-electric energy and taps the chilly Nordic air to cool the tens of thousands of servers.","Clonee, Ireland: In this western suburb of Dublin, Facebook is nearing completion on its first two buildings spanning 621,000 square feet, and recently announced plans for a third data center. Brookfield Renewable Ireland will supply the Clonee data center with renewable energy, primarily from wind power.","Fort Worth, Texas: This project will be the largest Facebook campus yet, consisting of five buildings with up to 2.5 million square feet of data center space. The original three-building site plan was expanded late last year, when Facebook said it would add two more data centers on a 39-acre property the company had acquired. The site has a power purchase agreement which will fund 200MW of new wind power for the Texas grid.","Las Lunas, New Mexico: Facebook’s Sept. 2016 announcement of this project has been followed by a series of expansion announcements. As the company prepares to open its first phase, the overall campus plan has expanded to include six buildings and nearly 3 million square feet of data center space. The project features a new design wrinkle: it will be cooled using indirect evaporative cooling systems that emphasize efficiency, while protecting servers from the frequent dust storms that occur in New Mexico. The data center will be powered entirely by solar and wind energy Facebook plans to procure from PNM Resources.","Odense, Denmark: Last month Facebook announced its newest international site in Denmark. “Our Odense facility will be one of the most advanced, energy-efficient data centers in the world,” the company said. “It will feature the latest in our Open Compute Project hardware designs that result in world-class levels of energy efficiency. It will be cooled using outdoor air and indirect evaporative cooling systems that emphasize water and energy efficiency—and like our five previous data centers, our newest facility here in Odense will be powered by 100% clean and renewable energy.”","Papillion, Nebraska: In April 2017, Facebook unveiled plans to build a new data center campus in Papillion, a suburb of Omaha. In March 2018 the company announced plans to build an additional four data centers at the Nebraska site, expanding the total project to six data centers and 2.6 million square feet of space.","New Albany, Ohio: Facebook is said to be investing $750 million in a 900,000 square foot data center in New Albany, an Ohio town that also hosts a cloud computing data center for Amazon Web Services.","Henrico County, Virginia: Facebook will spend $750 million to build a 970,000 square foot data center in the White Oak Technology Park in Sandston, as it continues to accelerate its massive investment in Internet infrastructure. Facebook will also invest “hundreds of millions” of millions of additional dollars in the construction of multiple solar facilities in Virginia, which will provide the Henrico County Data Center with 100 percent renewable energy.","Newton County, Georgia: In February 2017, Facebook unveiled plans to build a new data center campus in Stanton Springs, Georgia. Facebook will invest about $750 million in the facility in Newton County, about 40 miles east of downtown Atlanta, where it will build two data centers spanning 970,000 square feet. The buildings will be fully operational in 2020. The data center will be supported by renewable energy from the Walton Electric Membership Corporation (EMC), which will install hundreds of acres of solar panels on Georgia’s electric grid as part of a power supply agreement with Facebook.","Stay informed: Get our news updates!","About Rich Miller","I write about the places where the Internet lives, telling the story of data centers and the people who build them.

That's all that really matters. Selling out your information and your freind's information is their business model, there is no scenario where it changes. The only solution is to leave and spread awareness","Surprised it took you this long, but good for you. Now take it a step further and go for the full \"deletion.\" I did it 2 years ago and don't miss it one bit. You also figure out who your real friends are. Everyone on there had my number if they wanted to talk to me.","My issue is I'll be with people who love their social media, so of course they take their group selfies and I try hard not to be in the picture. You can see it on their phone, the boxes that go around everyone's face recognizing who you are before the picture is even taken ready to be put into the data mine.","Been trying to spread awareness for years. So far, the only concrete results are that I lost contact with all my friends from college, my employees resent that I don't know what's going on in their lives, and my mom is sad because I threatened to stop sending her pics of her grandson if she won't stop sharing them with her friends on FB.","I user to say that as with anything that is massively entertaining, useful, and profitable, only one thing will make it stop: children dying. That's the only time government, especially Republicans, act on any kind of regulation.","Now I can't even say that anymore, children are dying in school mass shootings and the Republican-controlled federal government is not only doing nothing, but addressing imaginary problems that have nothing to do with the real issue.","It took a long time, but I was able to convert the family and in-laws to Signal. Now, everyone uses that instead of FB/WhatsApp/FaceTime. Put a lot of effort into it, and continue to put your foot down, explaining and sharing your disgust of people who share their privates on platforms that they know only intend on hurting them.","Please educate me: how is Signal a replacement for Facebook (unless you mean just Facebook Messenger) ? Does it have public Groups with data files and such ? Can you post pictures ? Is there an equivalent of NewsFeed, where you see lots of posts from all your friends ?","You can have group chats, and you can post pictures, share videos, and do video chat, etc. That stated, there is no newsfeed. Signal is more akin to WhatsApp than it is to Facebook. I referenced Facebook specifically because WhatsApp is owned and operated by Facebook, even though it technically 'runs' on the Signal protocol. Anyhow, smaller, closer, more genuine social circles are probably more endeared than larger, potentially superfluous ones.","Maybe try hosting a Diaspora pod. I have no idea on the security/privacy of the platform but as you host it, you at least control parts of it. I think it’s FOSS as well. Maybe a good intermediate step to wean them off FB if they are addicted.","Violence is inherent in the human race. We're competitive animals, at heart. We have anger, stupidity, conflict. No human society has ever succeeded in stopping all violence.","What we CAN do in modern society is take away the tools that enable violence to turn very lethal very quickly. Somehow all other major countries do just FINE without having to arm their citizens to the teeth. All countries have criminals, drunks, racists, druggies, mentally ill, wacky teenagers, domestic disputes. But other comparable countries have homicide rates 1/2 to 1/5 that of USA. I think the difference is guns. We should ban or hugely reduce the number of guns.","Yes, sometimes a \"good guy with a gun\" works. But overall, the way to fix the problem is to have far fewer guns, not far more.","And stack the occasional \"good guy with a gun\" incident against the flood of routine murders, accidents, mistakes, suicides, crimes with guns. Guns are a huge net negative.","The biggest killer in history is governments through all their large-scale wars. Shouldn't we be taking guns away from the military and police and giving it to local militias/citizens?","If those governments hadn't had guns, there would have been far fewer deaths.","The ratio of 1/2 or 1/5 gun deaths compared to the US is irrelevant given the benefits to society listed above.","Somehow other major countries get all the same benefits USA does (better, in fact: lower homicide rate, better health, etc) with far fewer guns. We're the stupid kid on the block.","Arming teachers will reduce school shootings.","Doubtful. You'll have a big increase in accidents, mistakes, probably suicides, probably stolen guns. And school shooters are motivated by anger; they're not making a careful calculation about deterrence. There was an armed sheriff's deputy working at the Parkland high school, but the shooter attacked the school anyway.","\"It's the easiest way to stay in touch casually with my family and friends, who are spread 1/3 of the way around the world, have tight and varied schedules, and when only some unpredictable subset of them may be interested in any one thing I post. Almost all of my family and friends are on Facebook.\"","Do you really know the extent of their tracking? \"Just don't post really private stuff\" seems to indicate otherwise","Do you know they are scraping your contact list, monitoring your location, and possibly recording your mic if you install their mobile app? Do you know they are tracking what websites you visit outside of facebook? Do you know they are gathering most of this data from your friends even if you don't give it to them yourself?","Yes, I was aware of all that. I put very little in my phone Contacts list. Don't have the FB app installed on my phone. Run blockers to prevent tracking on other web sites. Yes, I know they harvest from my friends and family.","I wish they didn't do all that tracking, it would be nicer to have lower \"costs\". But still for me the benefits outweigh the current costs.","In iOS, if you go to Settings -> Privacy, it gives listings and rights of any applications regarding location, contacts, calendars, reminders, photos, Bluetooth, microphones, speech recognition, cameras, health information, HomeKit, media, and \"motion & fitness\". In order to get initial permission, there's a popup for each service when the application first tries to use it. These may be changed at any time.","I stopped using FB years ago when I became more privacy-conscious after the Snowden leaks. It wasn't just about my privacy though. I also don't like the idea of my personal info and everything I've said on FB being sold to advertisers. I was sick of being a product.","I'm not in contact with a lot of my family and friends since I stopped using FB. If they really want to talk to me then they can add me on Wire. That's what I use to talk to my friend, my sister, and my cousin. Wire is secure and privacy-focused. It’s a great program and is open source and uses end-to-end encryption. I can relax knowing that what I say is between me and the person I’m talking to.","It’s a great alternative to Skype and other messenger programs. I don’t know for sure, but I suspect that Windows stores your Skype messages and builds profiles on you to sell to advertisers. I know it sounds like I’m advertising for Wire, but I’m not affiliated with them in any way. I just really love Wire and want more people to know about it.","The privacy issues with Windows 10 is one of the reasons I switched to Linux. I only use Windows to play games that aren't available on Linux. Deleting my FB was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Granted, there's family and friends that I can't keep in contact with anymore, but that's something I'm willing to sacrifice. I hate everything FB stands for. I'll admit that I miss it sometimes, but I'm happier now without it.","Facebook deactivated my account and is extorting me for ID. I'm just not going back. It's sad because I have pictures of dead love ones and original esays and poetry I don't have copies of. I'm just never using anything related to Facebook ever again.","The problem is that fb keeps your gov issued photo ID forever. I researched it when they did the same shit to me. And you don’t know who you’re sending it to because they refuse to reciprocate their info. Ironically, I remember saying to the person that fb wasn’t the Pentagon and I wasn’t giving them my info. Little did I know at the time....","woooooow so you mean to say your heads up your ass so deep that you equate a social media account that's filled with friends dating back to 80s and family member with the exact same last name on the level of a financial institution that holds your money?","you are the damn problem. Suckers like you fall for anything. This is why the America sucks. People like you who find a way to except trivial web sites having your drivers license number which is data based right along with social security number.","Yeah dude, rip me a new one on that example. I understand that it's shitty to provide a federal ID, but what the fuck else could any online company use to realistically identify a person? We have an identity problem in the information age, and using a drivers liscense to identify yourself is the best damn thing we have currently. Maybe if we all went the way of Estonia and had digital verification we wouldn't have to send pictures, but you are missing the point.","Would you rather someone other than yourself unlock your (I'm guessing deactivated) Facebook account? Or would you rather the company at least attempt to make sure that the right person is trying to access an account","And what of the thousands of advertisers than collect and sell information on a daily basis from phones, TV, and the internet? If you are going to direct anger towards Facebook, which I agree with, at least point out that hundreds of other companies use similar business models by collecting and selling users information, habits, and interests.","I thought if you want to get rid of anything, you start with the biggest one first. Sure the others do it, but not at such a scale and those 'hundreds' of other companies aren't visited daily with people sharing everything. Lets stat at the start and not shoot small fish without getting rid of the biggest one first.","I'm saying scapegoat Facebook right now to push for broad legislation against this type of behavior. In the same way gun control is being pushed as a whole issue through scapegoating of a school shooting.","I think we agree that we want privacy when it comes to mass data collection.","So what information are they getting from the friends of the people who used the research app? Do they just see the list of friends and what is publicly available on the friend's profile? Or can they see the friend's info that's only accessible to friends because the app is consider that user?

Perhaps I was one of the few having that problem, and it wasn’t censorship. At least, that’s what I wanted to believe. The opposite idea was worrisome.","It wasn’t until the following Thursday that I mentioned my trouble of tweeting it out in a conversation with Stacy Washington, who was also having trouble tweeting certain things.","Three sources confirming their inability to disseminate certain bits of information.","The nature of Schlichter’s article could be considered a call to violence…by anyone who didn’t read it with a comprehension level past grade 3. What Schlichter wrote about, in no uncertain terms, is that in the midst of leftist groups feeling completely free to resort to violence and attempt to limit our free speech, any attempt to come to blows would end badly for everyone involved, but specifically so for blue America, currently living in a carefully temperature controlled bubble.","The left went so far as to call Schlichter crazy for this article. They wrote it off as nonsense, or the ramblings of a macho-conservative type trying to flex his muscles. Odd that for all their minimization of Schlichter and his article, they felt the need to restrict its distribution.","But perhaps Twitter didn’t want any ideas of violence on either side roaming around their platform any more than it already had. Okay, but then on Wednesday, Twitter did some more censorship, this time with something that had nothing to do with violence at all.","Crowder and co. were punished for their making light of a social justice sacred cow. Apparently, poking fun at gender-fluidity crossed a very stark line for the social justice driven tech companies, and so he was punished for it.","Interestingly, while Crowder was being silenced for daring to make fun of a protected group on the left, and Schlichter’s article was being restricted for his warning AGAINST becoming violent, Twitter has little problem allowing depictions of violence against Republicans.","Believe me, this image has been reported many times to Twitter. It remains completely available for viewing.","Twitter, Google, Facebook, et al, are private companies. They may restrict whomever they want at their leisure. However, the kinds of information they are censoring, vs the things they let flourish tell a much darker story than simple censorship.","Violence is okay, so long as it’s violence against the right people.","Comedic ribbing at the expense of certain groups will not be tolerated."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-15"}

A source who has spoken with the US president told the news site, “He’s wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.”","That said, Trump’s obsession with Amazon is nothing new. Trump has grumbled about Amazon’s tax treatment and CEO Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post (which he is fond of calling the “Amazon Washington Post” and “Fake News Washington Post”) since at least 2015.

The company, which was already facing scrutiny for selling ads to foreign groups seeking to disrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential election and inadvertently facilitating the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories, is getting hammered for allowing the profile data of 50 million Americans to be used by political operatives without users’ consent.","The group that used the data, Cambridge Analytica, did so to create and spread highly targeted advertisements seeking to elect Donald Trump and discredit Hillary Clinton in the lead up to the presidential election. But the organization received that information through questionable means, according to the New York Times.","The entire mess might have you wondering how you can control who sees your data on Facebook, or even how to delete your profile entirely. If that’s the case, I’ve got you covered.","Here’s how to control your data on Facebook, and, if you’re particularly fed up, how to delete your account entirely.","The data Facebook uses","Facebook lays out exactly what data it collects to craft a profile about you that can be used to target you with specific ads on its Data Use Policy site. And, as you might expect, it collects everything. Any post, like, comment, picture, video, friend you’ve added, news article or inside joke you’ve put on Facebook can be used as a means to serve you advertisements.","Facebook uses your personal information to match you up with various advertisements on the social network.","Facebook can also use data like your date of birth, location and other information to provide you with ads you might find relevant, and improve the site itself.","Think of it as the built-in cost of using a massive service like Facebook for free.","It’s not just the information you share on Facebook that gets scooped up, though. All of those sites and services you log into using your Facebook account have access to some of your data, and how they handle that info is up to them.","Then there’s the content friends post about you. Yes, all of those pictures, memes and stories your friends tag you in get collected by Facebook, too. And unfortunately, you don’t have control of that information since you didn’t post it.","It’s important to note that Facebook isn’t the only company that collects and uses your data like this. Google (GOOG,GOOGL) and Twitter (TWTR) also use information about you to determine which advertisements to show you and help advertisers better target their campaigns.","Controlling your data","Facebook considers information you share publicly to be fair game for use with targeted advertisements. And while you can change the visibility of some of your data such as posts and photos, information like your name, profile picture and cover photo, networks, gender, username and user ID (how apps identify you) are always considered public.","If you want to see fewer ads regarding a specific topic on Facebook, you can visit the Facebook Ad Preferences site. From here, you can control what kind of information Facebook thinks it knows about you. You won’t actually be able to delete that data, but you’ll be able to control the kinds of ads you see.","For example, Facebook recognizes that I’ve interacted with pages about action role-playing games, Hulu, the Wall Street Journal and others. If I no longer want to see ads about those topics, I can simply click the “X” icon in the top right corner of each interest.","You can delete categories that Facebook thinks you have interest in to stop seeing ads on specific topics.","You can also remove yourself from categories that Facebook matches you up with that help advertisers serve you certain ads. Facebook, for instance, lists me as being an engaged shopper, commuter, console gamer and early adopter. I can, however, remove myself from those categories to stop seeing ads based on that content.","Similarly, you can choose to prevent Facebook from showing you online interest-based ads or ads on apps and websites by opting out of these settings.","Then there are apps including games and services like Spotify that can access your basic Facebook profile information. If you never want to use those services again, you can disable them from your Facebook account by turning off Facebook Platform applications. Once you do that, these outside apps will no longer have access to your profile data.","If you revoke access Spotify’s access to your Facebook profile, you’ll need to create a new Spotify login.","For apps like Spotify, which allows you to log in with your Facebook account, you’ll need to cancel your Facebook-based profile and start a new one with a standard login.","Deleting Facebook","Of course, if you’re completely at the end of your rope when it comes to Facebook, you can simply choose to erase your presence from the service by deleting your account. Before you do so, though, it’s worth noting that getting rid of your Facebook account also means you’ll be cutting yourself off from a large chunk of your online social circle.","You won’t be able to spy on that one guy who dumped you in high school or call out Brad when he tells you he was too sick to hang out last night, but still managed to post pictures of himself at the bar with Sharon.","If you’re willing to give that up, along with the ability to send and receive invitations to various parties, which is why I primarily use the service, then you can take the leap and say goodbye to your account.","Before you do that, though, you should know that deleting your account means saying goodbye to all of those photos and videos you’ve uploaded to the service over the years. To save those, you can download your Facebook archive by navigating to the Settings menu from the Facebook desktop site.","Next, click “General” and select “Download a copy of your Facebook data” at the bottom of the page. This will ensure you have access to everything you’ve posted on the site since you originally joined.","Now you can delete your account. To do so you’ll need to follow this link, as Facebook seems to purposely make it difficult to end your relationship with the site.","Click “Delete my Account,” and you’ll see a pop-up window asking you if you’re sure you want to delete your profile. You’ll then need to enter your password and fill out a Captcha to confirm your decision.","Facebook seems to purposely make it hard to delete your account.","It could take up to 90 days for Facebook to fully delete all of the information you’ve uploaded to its servers. During that time, no one will be able to interact with your account.","Unfortunately, some things won’t be deleted during this process including posts you’ve been tagged in or messages you’ve previously sent to friends.","And that’s that.

But we can make a pretty good guess at what data Cambridge Analytica obtained by looking at the endpoints of Facebook's Graph API v1.0 (application programming interface) which launched April 21, 2010, and wasn't fully closed down until April 30, 2015.","Using Facebook's Graph API v1.0, developers had unfettered access to almost all of your public-facing profile data, including:","The heart of the scandal focuses on one of the API's permissions groups called \"Extended Profile Properties.\" These endpoints provided access to data about your friends that your friends may not have explicitly granted permission for Facebook to expose, specifically:","In another permissions group, the API exposed an endpoint called read_mailbox which, just as it sounds, allowed developers access to users' private messages.","Wow, that's a lot of data. What can you do with it?","With tens of millions of rich data profiles, you can apply the tools of data scientific research to turn the data into action. This usually follows a disciplined methodology that starts with transforming the data into usable cohorts and clusters, learning about the propensities of the different cohorts and clusters, and then predicting how they might react to messaging by using simulations (Will a $10 discount work better than a coupon for a 10 percent discount? Is this cohort likely to vote for X?). Optimization is another common use for data (Let's optimize our media buy to drive 5 percent higher conversions by doing X. Let's get more people to vote for X). None of this is new. None of this is news. This is how internet advertising works.","Wait. What?","As crazy as this may sound, all of the sensationalist craziness, the ~$50 billion of Facebook value wiped out by the scandal, and all the talk of espionage and intrigue are basically about the realization that your data is used to serve you highly relevant, hyper-targeted messages. Again: Not new. Not news.","If Cambridge Analytica didn't obtain this data set from Facebook, it could have simply purchased a bunch of data and used best practices mar-tech tools to accomplish its marketing goals. Not surprisingly, a fair number of digital marketers I've spoken to about this believe that Cambridge Analytica would have achieved better results by leveraging the platforms directly.","Why do I care about this?","The silver lining to the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal is the fact that you are becoming aware of what data you create, what is collected, and how it is used. This is a very good thing.","When Facebook urges you to configure your privacy settings, they are using the wrong words. The company should be advising you that you are actually configuring your \"Public Persona Settings\" or your \"Online Presence Settings\" or simply your \"Public Settings.\" Whom you share your stuff with and who gets to see it are practically meaningless in the context of this issue.","What you should be configuring is your \"Personal Data Sharing Permission Settings\" or \"API Endpoint Permissions.\" These settings would restrict the data that could be extracted while we are passively going about our business online.","Way too complicated!","No. It really isn't. As a society, we have to raise our level of data maturity. Clearly Facebook has grown faster than it has matured. Societally, we are all neophytes when it comes to data literacy and data governance.","If you want control of your data, it would be a great idea to understand what that means. \"They know everything about me,\" says someone scared out of their wits by sensationalist headlines. No. They don't. They have data that can be turned into action to enrich organizations smart enough to use it. Are you hurt by this? Could you be?","Right now, you get to use Facebook, Google, Gmail, Waze, and other \"free\" apps for the cost of your data. If you don't want to pay with your data, you are welcome to make other choices. But you should understand how your data is being used before making a blanket statement that your data should be 100 percent private and 100 percent protected. Data is a form of currency, and it is a valid way to pay for goods and services. Data can be (and is) transformed into cash by tech companies. But that does not diminish the value of the services they provide.","Just because you did not take the time to learn how you were paying for a tech service and you thought it was \"free\" doesn't mean it is actually free and, most importantly, that you would be willing to pay cash money for it.","So let's use this scandal as an opportunity to learn as much as we can about data so when we start the regulatory process, we do it in a responsible way.","Author's note: This is not a sponsored post.

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn't authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook's unusual public explanation of the move wasn't clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company. For the \"avoidance of doubt,\" the spokesman said, none of Kogan's data was used in Cambridge Analytica's 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign.","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Nix said Assange said no. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes. Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

But the timeline doesn't add up. The spanking took place in July 2006 and the Forbes magazine with Trump on the cover came out in September 2006, with a dateline of October 2006.","The only new magazine that Trump would have called his own at that time was the premiere issue of TRUMP magazine. It had just been produced under a licensing agreement with Trump in the way of other properties to which he lent his name and spoke of as if they were his, in this instance all the more so because he was a major shareholder in the publishing company.","He was, of course, on the cover.","“He was showing you his own picture on the cover of a magazine,” Cooper remarked to Daniels. “Right, right,” Daniels said.","“And so I was like, “Does this-- does this normally work for you?’ And he looked very taken-- taken back, like, he didn’t really understand what I was saying. Like, I was, ‘Does, just, you know, talking about yourself normally work?’ And I was like, ‘Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it.’”","Daniels laughed at the memory. She continued, “And I’ll never forget the look on his face. He was like-- I don’t think anyone's ever spoken to him like that, especially, you know, a young woman who looked like me. And I said, you know, ‘Give me that,’ and I just remember him going, ‘You wouldn’t.’ ‘Hand it over.’ And-- so he did, and I was like, ‘turn around, drop ’em.’ So he turned around and pulled his pants down a little-- you know had underwear on and stuff and I just gave him a couple swats.”","Along with Trump’s photo, the magazine’s cover was emblazoned with the words ON TOP OF THE WORLD. Another cover line read:","“BUBBLE? WHAT BUBBLE? Real Estate Tips From Trump U.”","What made it the perfect paddle to be used on such a supreme con man was that TRUMP magazine led investors to lose their savings in three distinct ways.","One way was by investing in the company that published it.","Premier Publishing Group celebrated going public in 2006 with a big party at Trump Tower attended by The Donald, his daughter Ivana and his son, Eric. The ebullient elder Trump was slated to get a six-figure annual license few as well as 16 percent of the stock. The New York Post knew nothing of the elder Trump’s tryst with Daniels and was just being clever when it when it asked what name he would adopt if he went into porn.","“Big,” Trump said, then offering a second choice: “The Trump Tower.”","The hype, along with an insistent sales force making cold calls a la “The Wolf of Wall Street” convinced investors as far away as Holland to put in sums as big as six figures. Most of them appear to have lost whatever they invested.","A second way to lose money through Trump magazine was to follow the tips from Trump University touted by the cover line and detailed by the accompanying article. The magazine relayed reassurances from Trump that that there was no real estate bubble. And, even if there were, and even if it burst, he would welcome it because he could go in and make a lot of money.","“At the launch party for the mag that Stormy would later spank him with, Donald was asked what his porn name would be. ‘Big,’ he said, or ‘The Trump Tower.’”","A bubble bigger than anybody imagined did in fact burst two years later, nearly wiping out Trump himself, not to mention investors who followed his advice. The global economy almost collapsed.","The third way to lose money through Trump magazine was to be persuaded by the article not just to follow bum tips from Trump University, but also to enroll as a student and begin paying excessive fees for instruction of little value.","Trump University’s victims would subsequently sue and receive a $25 million settlement in restitution for the tuition and other fees they were hustled into paying. Nothing at all has gone to investors who lost by either investing in the magazine itself or by following the advice offered by its pages.","One person who almost did make money as a result of TRUMP magazine was a publishing executive named Mitchell Schultz. He suggested that an animated cartoon series called Trump Takeover would be a good way to promote the magazine and might even become a hit on its own. The episodes he proposed included one in which the hero SuperTrump becomes the President of the United States.","“And saves America,” the episode summary reports.","Tramp liked the idea and entered into a licensing agreement with Schultz, who received 300,000 shares in Premiere Publishing. The stock briefly topped a dollar and it seemed Schultz might actually profit from his efforts. The one hitch was he proved unable to sell it.","“I was running around trying,” he told The Daily Beast. “I said, ‘I’ll give you half price.’ I couldn’t do it. Nobody would bite.”","He wistfully added, “Everybody lost money.”","In recent days, Schultz became aware that Stephen Colbert and Showtime were coming out with an animated series called “Our Cartoon President.”","Schultz still had a licensing agreement with Trump for a cartoon series and he has been consulting with an entertainment lawyer to see if he has ground for legal action against Colbert.","Unlike with Stormy Daniels, Trump actually signed the agreement with Schultz.","“He did,” Schultz told The Daily Beast. “We have a written agreement.”","Schultz reported that since his publishing days he embarked on a new career in a fledgling industry that has a future, however distant."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The changes also enable users to prevent the social network from sharing that information with advertisers and other third parties.","\"Last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies and help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,\" Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan and Deputy General Counsel Ashlie Beringer wrote in a statement.","\"We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed,\" they said.","The changes make it easier for users to see what information they've shared, delete certain personal information and control ads that they see.","It is not clear whether this will mollify angry users, some of whom have called for a #DeleteFacebook boycott. Facebook released these changes after coming under intense public and regulatory pressure for unauthorized disclosures of private information to a third-party firm called Cambridge Analytica that allegedly used it to profile voters for the Trump campaign in 2016.","Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina, noted that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had promised simpler privacy controls in 2010. \"The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C.E.O.,\" she told The New York Times.","The scandal was only the latest for Facebook, which was already under fire for allowing its ad network to be exploited to promulgate fake news during the 2016 election. Its stock price has fallen sharply since the Cambridge Analytica news broke on March 17.

Clad in the Silicon Valley uniform of open-collar shirt and blazer, Spectre boasted that his company -- Philometrics -- would revolutionize the way online surveys were done, making it easier for companies to design questionnaires that people would actually respond to on Facebook, Twitter or other sites. Crucially, he said, the surveys could predict the responses for large groups from a small number of respondents and micro-target ads better.","\"The reality is working with big data, social media is incredibly difficult,\" said Spectre, who more commonly goes by Aleksandr Kogan, which he uses in his role as a Cambridge University researcher. \"You want to work with people who have a lot of experience. You want to connect with people who have been working with these massive data sets.\"","Kogan would know. On Friday, he was suspended by Facebook Inc. for his earlier work mining data on what the New York Times reported was as many as 50 million Facebook users and sharing it with Cambridge Analytica, a political-advertising firm that helped Donald Trump win the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook suspended Kogan over allegations that he lied when he said the data would be used for research purposes only. The social network suspended Cambridge Analytica as well.","The boyish-appearing Kogan has been thrown into the center of a scandal that has called into question not only the methods the Trump campaign used to psychoanalyze and target potential voters and win the presidency, but also the practices of Silicon Valley companies in allowing third parties to access and exploit private information.","Facebook has since disabled the feature that let Kogan amass personal data on millions of users when less than 1 percent of those people even downloaded his app. But the episode offers a glimpse into how promiscuous some internet giants actually are with information that many users assume is always kept secret.","Government officials in the U.S. and Europe are calling for Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to appear in front of lawmakers, and the demands for answers may foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network.","Kogan didn't respond to multiple attempts to reach him for comment. His ill-fated detour from the academic track into the darker corners of social media marketing began in 2014 when U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica turned to Kogan for help. The firm was interested in a data project Kogan had worked on at Cambridge University that was based on research into personality traits and social media.","Kogan, who had moved to the U.S. from Russia as a child and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 2008 with a degree in psychology before moving to Hong Kong for his doctorate, ultimately joined Cambridge University in 2012, where he remains a research associate in the psychology department, a position he has retained since relocating back to the San Francisco Bay area.","While at Cambridge University, Kogan formed a company in the U.K. called Global Science Research, which created an app called 'thisisyourdigitallife' that offered Facebook users personality predictions, in exchange for accessing their personal data on the social network and more limited information about their friends -- including their \"likes\" -- if their privacy settings allowed it. Only about 270,000 people downloaded the app, but the researchers were able to mine the profiles of tens of millions of people through tools Facebook had at the time that gave third parties access to a wide swath of information.","Kogan's company then took the results of those personality surveys and matched them to the users' actual likes on Facebook -- and the likes of their friends -- to build a model predicting personalities based on digital behavior. The company eventually gave Cambridge Analytica a list of millions of people in the U.S., with their names, locations, genders, ages and predicted test scores.","In his 2017 video promoting Philometrics, Kogan touted his team's unique expertise in cracking this code, of predicting the tastes of a large group of people from the responses of a smaller one, which he described as one of the central challenges of doing online research or targeted marketing. \"Social media data is incredible in its opportunities, but it's also incredibly challenging,\" Kogan said in the video.","Until 2014, Facebook's rules let third parties access this back-door channel to friends' data. That year, the company tightened its privacy settings to \"ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list.\" Facebook has worked to counter the description of what happened as a \"breach,\" but the reality is that the underlying act of data scraping by third parties was not only permitted but encouraged by the social network -- raising questions about how many others abused their access to Facebook user information.","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said the Facebook data wasn't used as part of the services it provided to Trump's presidential campaign, adding that it fully complies with Facebook's terms of service and is working with the company to resolve the matter.","A person familiar with Kogan's company's work last year told Bloomberg News that the methodology and data that it gave to Cambridge Analytica was almost useless in predicting individual personalities, because of a high error rate, and that Cambridge Analytica's claim of being able to provide behavioral micro-targeting of ads down to the individual level is more marketing bluster than Big Brother.","The more difficult issue for Facebook is that it had been aware of the controversy over Kogan and Cambridge Analytica's use of the information since 2015, when Facebook demanded he and Cambridge Analytica delete the data. The social network is now dealing with the fallout of being unable to police how collectors of private Facebook data during that time used the information, and whether they followed Facebook's rules about sharing or selling it. Facebook is also investigating whether one of its employees, Joseph Chancellor, who formed Global Science Research with Kogan while Chancellor was a doctoral student at Cambridge University, knew about the data leak. Chancellor is now a social-psychology researcher at Facebook. He didn't respond to a message via LinkedIn seeking comment.","Cambridge University said in a statement that it had no evidence to suggest that Kogan had used university resources or facilities for the Global Science Research work, but that it has contacted Facebook requesting \"all relevant evidence in their possession.\"","The University said that Kogan had sought permission from the head of the psychology department to work with St. Petersburg University on the condition that any grants he received would be \"in a private capacity, separate to his work at University of Cambridge.\"","A person familiar with Kogan's work says he had a grant that allowed him to do minimal teaching in 2017 and 2018, without specifying the source or nature of the award.","In 2015, Kogan and his new wife decided to change their last name to something that reflected their belief in both religion and science, and they settled on Spectre, six months before the James Bond film of the same name came out, and long before Russian election meddling dominated the news. A person close to Kogan said the name change had nothing to do with the controversy surrounding his work. \"What person would change their name to a Bond villain,\" the person said, \"to avoid bad press?\"","(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

(AFP Photo/Loic Venance)","LONDON (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company’s subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","“For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. “I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen’s rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I’ll settle for 2018.”","The US has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing former president Barack Obama’s 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google’s dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized “the right to be forgotten,” allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there’s no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany’s use of personal information to target Jews hasn’t been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today’s world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","“The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,” said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU’s new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking “I Agree.” The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there’s the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn’t legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it’s too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to “bracket off” European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While US-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn’t go down well in Europe.","“Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,” she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. “We’ve built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,” it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone’s data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the US, where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","“Cambridge Analytica’s story sounds like a spy novel,” he said. “It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix.

This is something that I’ve brought up directly with my meetings with Facebook over the past couple of years.”","Earlier today, the all-party House of Commons ethics committee voted unanimously in favour of inviting Wylie, Facebook officials and the federal privacy commissioner to appear in front of them to discuss the privacy implications for Canada related to the Facebook revelations about Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

It’s probably not even in the top 10. But given the outsized role that tech companies now play, it’s time to focus on the ethical responsibilities of the technologists who help shape our lives.","In a recent talk, technologist Maciej Ceglowski argued that “[t]his year especially there’s an uncomfortable feeling in the tech industry that we did something wrong, that in following our credo of ‘move fast and break things,’ some of what we knocked down were the load-bearing walls of our democracy.”","So we already knew that tools for “maximizing engagement” can shape the political sphere. In 2014, Wadhwa concluded, “Whether it wants this responsibility or not, Facebook has now become an integral part of the democratic process globally.”","We also know that technology can be harmful to our democracy. Privacy invasions and algorithmic manipulation, for example, can limit the ability to research and formulate opinions, and then in turn affect how people express views—even via voting. When companies implement practices that are good for targeted advertising but bad for individuals’ democratic engagement (like, for example, the practices involved in the use of “dark posts” on Facebook, tied to the creation of psychological profiles for hundreds of millions of Facebook users in the U.S.), the benefits-versus-harms balance tilts pretty sharply.","Who minds that balance?","You often hear the adage that law can’t keep up with technology. What about ethics? Ethics, too, is deliberative, and new norms take some time to develop; but an initial ethical analysis of a new development or practice can happen fairly quickly. Many technologists, however, are not encouraged to conduct that analysis, even superficially. They are not even taught to spot an ethical issue—and some (though certainly not all) seem surprised when backlash ensues against some of their creations. (See, for example, the critical coverage of the now-defunct Google Buzz, or more recent reaction to, say, “Hello Barbie.”)","A growing chorus has argued that we need a code of ethics for technologists. That’s a start, but we need more than that. If technology can mold us, and technologists are the ones who shape that technology, we should demand some level of ethics training for technologists. And that training should not be limited to the university context; an ethics training component should also be included in the curriculum of any developer “bootcamp,” and maybe in the onboarding process when tech companies hire new employees.","Such training would not inoculate technologists against making unethical decisions—nothing can do that, and in some situations we may well reach no consensus on what the ethical action is. Such training, however, would prepare them to make more thoughtful decisions when confronted, say, with ethical dilemmas that involve conflicts between competing goods. It would help them make choices that better reflect their own values.","Sometimes, we need consumers and regulators to push back against Big Tech. But in his talk titled “Build a Better Monster: Morality, Machine Learning, and Mass Surveillance,” Maciej Ceglowski argues that “[t]he one effective lever we have against tech companies is employee pressure. Software engineers are difficult to hire, expensive to train, and take a long time to replace.” If he is right, then tech employees might have even more power than people realized—or at least an additional kind of power they can wield. All the more reason why we should demand that technologists get at least some ethics training and recognize their role in defending democracy.","I work in an applied ethics center, and we do believe that technology can help democracy (we offer a free ethical-decision-making app, for example; we even offer a MOOC—a free online course—on ethical campaigning!). For it to do that, though, we need people who are ready to tackle the ethical questions—both within and outside of tech companies.","This article is part of a collaboration with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.\"","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,\" he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

{"originalurl":"http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Information_Science","title":"Information Science - New World Encyclopedia","text":["Information Science","The Ancient Library of Alexandria, an early form of information storage and retrieval.","Information science (also information studies) is an interdisciplinary science primarily concerned with the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information. Information science studies the application and usage of knowledge in organizations, and the interaction between people, organizations and information systems. It is often (mistakenly) considered a branch of computer science. It is actually a broad, interdisciplinary field, incorporating not only aspects of computer science, but also library science, cognitive, and social sciences.","Information science focuses on understanding problems from the perspective of the stakeholders involved and then applying information (and other) technology as needed. In other words, it tackles systemic problems first rather than individual pieces of technology within that system. In this respect, information science can be seen as a response to technological determinism, the belief that technology \"develops by its own laws, that it realizes its own potential, limited only by the material resources available, and must therefore be regarded as an autonomous system controlling and ultimately permeating all other subsystems of society.\"[1] Within information science, attention has been given in recent years to human–computer interaction, groupware, the semantic web, value sensitive design, iterative design processes and to the ways people generate, use and find information.","Information science should not be confused with information theory, the study of a particular mathematical concept of information, or with library science, a field related to libraries which uses some of the principles of information science.","Information science and informatics","Some authors treat informatics as a synonym for information science. Because of the rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary nature of informatics, a precise meaning of the term \"informatics\" is presently difficult to pin down. Regional differences and international terminology complicate the problem. Some people note that much of what is called \"Informatics\" today was once called \"Information Science\" at least in fields such as Medical Informatics. However when library scientists began also to use the phrase \"Information Science\" to refer to their work, the term informatics emerged in the United States as a response by computer scientists to distinguish their work from that of library science, and in Britain as a term for a science of information that studies natural, as well as artificial or engineered, information-processing systems.","History","Early beginnings","Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, a philosopher who made significant contributions to what is now called \"information science.\"","Information science, in studying the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information has origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis has been carried out by scholars at least as early as the time of the Abyssinian Empire with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives.[2] Institutionally, information science emerged in the nineteenth century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the history of science, beginning with publication of the first issues of ‘‘Philosophical Transactions,’’ generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society (London).","The institutionalization of science occurred throughout the eighteenth century. In 1731, Benjamin Franklin established the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first “public” library, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of scientific experiment, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments.[3] Academie de Chirurgia (Paris) published ‘‘Memoires pour les Chirurgiens,’’ generally considered to be the first medical journal, in 1736. The American Philosophical Society, patterned on the Royal Society (London), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded, Alois Senefelder developed the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in Germany in 1796.","Nineteenth century","Joseph Marie Jacquard.","By the nineteenth century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation. In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in France. It was the first use of \"memory storage of patterns\" system.[4] As chemistry journals emerge throughout the 1820s and 1830s,[5]Charles Babbage developed his \"difference engine,\" the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his \"analytical engine” by 1834. By 1843, Richard Hoe developed the rotary press, and in 1844 Samuel Morse sent the first public telegraph message. By 1848, William F. Poole began the ‘‘Index to Periodical Literature,’’ the first general periodical literature index in the U.S.","In 1854, George Boole published ‘‘An Investigation into Laws of Thought…,’’ which laid the foundations for Boolean algebra, which is later used in information retrieval.[6] In 1860, a congress was held at Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule to discuss the feasibility of establishing a systematic and rational nomenclature for chemistry. The congress does not reach any conclusive results, but several key participants return home with Stanislao Cannizzaro's outline (1858), which ultimately convinced them of the validity of his scheme for calculating atomic weights.[7]","By 1865 the Smithsonian Institution began a catalog of current scientific papers, which became the ‘‘International Catalogue of Scientific Papers’’ in 1902.[8] The following year the Royal Society began publication of its ‘‘Catalogue of Papers’’ in London. In 1866, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S.W. Soule produced the first practical typewriter. By 1872, Lord Kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides, and by 1875 Frank Baldwin was granted the first U.S. patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions.[9]Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison invented the phonograph and telephone in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and the American Library Association is founded in Philadelphia. By 1879, ‘‘Index Medicus’’ is first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, with John Shaw Billings as librarian, and later the library issues ‘‘Index Catalogue,’’ which achieves an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.[10]","European documentation","As many other disciplines emerged in the late part of the nineteenth century, as well as several more scientific indexes to organize scholarly literature, so did European Documentation, which marked the earliest theoretical foundations of modern information science. Most information science historians cite Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine as the fathers of information science with the founding of the International Institute of Bibliography (IIB) in 1895.[11] However, “information science” as a term is not popularly used in academia until after World War II.[12]","Documentalists emphasized the utilitarian integration of technology and technique toward specific social goals. According to Ronald Day, “As an organized system of techniques and technologies, documentation was understood as a player in the historical development of global organization in modernity—indeed, a major player inasmuch as that organization was dependent on the organization and transmission of information.”[12] Otlet and Lafontaine (who won the Nobel Prize in 1913) not only envisioned later technical innovations but also projected a global vision for information and information technologies that speaks directly to postwar visions of a global “information society.” Otlet and Lafontaine established numerous organizations dedicated to standardization, bibliography, international associations, and consequently, international cooperation. These organizations were fundamental for ensuring international production in commerce, information, communication and modern economic development, and they later found their global form in such institutions as the League of Nations and the United Nations. Otlet designed the Universal Decimal Classification, based on Melville Dewey’s decimal classification system.[12]","Although he lived decades before computers and networks emerged, what he discussed prefigured what ultimately became the World Wide Web. His vision of a great network of knowledge was centered on documents and included the notions of hyperlinks, search engines, remote access, and social networks. (Obviously these notions were described by different names.)","Otlet not only imagined that all the world's knowledge should be interlinked and made available remotely to anyone (what he called an International Network for Universal Documentation), he also proceeded to build a structured document collection that involved standardized paper sheets and cards filed in custom-designed cabinets according to an ever-expanding ontology, an indexing staff which culled information worldwide from as diverse sources as possible, and a commercial information retrieval service which answered written requests by copying relevant information from index cards. Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.[12] By 1937, documentation had formally been institutionalized, as evidenced by the founding of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), later called the American Society for Information Science and Technology.","Transition to modern information science","With the 1950s came an increasing awareness of the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and micro computers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with library programs. Furthermore, they began to incorporate disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, as well as other professional programs, such as law and medicine in their curriculum. By the 1980s, large databases, such as Grateful Med at the National Library of Medicine, and user-oriented services such as Dialog and Compuserve, were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous Special Interest Groups to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, Special Interest Groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.","Topics in information science","Data modeling","Data modeling is the process of creating a data model by applying a data model theory to create a data model instance. A data model theory is a formal data model description. See database model for a list of current data model theories.","When data modeling, one is structuring and organizing data. These data structures are then typically implemented in a database management system. In addition to defining and organizing the data, data modeling will impose (implicitly or explicitly) constraints or limitations on the data placed within the structure.","Managing large quantities of structured and unstructured data is a primary function of information systems. Data models describe structured data for storage in data management systems such as relational databases. They typically do not describe unstructured data, such as word processing documents, email messages, pictures, digital audio, and video.","Groupware","Groupware is software designed to help people involved in a common task achieve their goals. Collaborative software is the basis for computer supported cooperative work.","Such software systems as email, calendaring, text chat, wiki belong in this category. It has been suggested that Metcalfe's law—the more people who use something, the more valuable it becomes—applies to such software.","The more general term social software applies to systems used outside the workplace, for example, online dating services and social networks like Friendster. The study of computer-supported collaboration includes the study of this software and social phenomena associated with it.","Human-computer interaction","Human-computer interaction (HCI), alternatively man-machine interaction (MMI) or computer–human interaction (CHI), is the study of interaction between people (users) and computers. It is an interdisciplinary subject, relating computer science with many other fields of study and research. Interaction between users and computers occurs at the user interface (or simply interface), which includes both software and hardware, for example, general purpose computer peripherals and large-scale mechanical systems such as aircraft and power plants.","Information architecture","Information architecture is the practice of structuring information (knowledge or data) for a purpose. These are often structured according to their context in user interactions or larger databases. The term is most commonly applied to Web development, but also applies to disciplines outside of a strict Web context, such as programming and technical writing. Information architecture is considered an element of user experience design.","The term information architecture describes a specialized skill set which relates to the management of information and employment of informational tools. It has a significant degree of association with the library sciences. Many library schools now teach information architecture.","An alternate definition of information architecture exists within the context of information system design, in which information architecture refers to data modeling and the analysis and design of the information in the system, concentrating on entities and their interdependencies. Data modeling depends on abstraction; the relationships between the pieces of data is of more interest than the particulars of individual records, though cataloging possible values is a common technique. The usability of human-facing systems, and standards compliance of internal ones, are paramount.","Information ethics","Information ethics is the field that investigates the ethical issues arising from the development and application of information technologies. It provides a critical framework for considering moral issues concerning informational privacy, moral agency (for example, whether artificial agents may be moral), new environmental issues (especially how agents should one behave in the infosphere), problems arising from the life-cycle (creation, collection, recording, distribution, processing, and so on) of information (especially ownership and copyright, digital divide). Information Ethics is therefore strictly related to the fields of computer ethics (Floridi, 1999) and the philosophy of information.","Dilemmas regarding the life of information are becoming increasingly important in a society that is defined as \"the information society.\" Information transmission and literacy are essential concerns in establishing an ethical foundation that promotes fair, equitable, and responsible practices. Information ethics broadly examines issues related to, among other things, ownership, access, privacy, security, and community.","Professional codes offer a basis for making ethical decisions and applying ethical solutions to situations involving information provision and use which reflect an organization’s commitment to responsible information service. Evolving information formats and needs require continual reconsideration of ethical principles and how these codes are applied. Considerations regarding information ethics influence personal decisions, professional practice, and public policy.","Information retrieval","Information retrieval (IR), often studied in conjunction with information storage, is the science of searching for information in documents, searching for documents themselves, searching for metadata which describe documents, or searching within databases, whether relational stand-alone databases or hypertextually-networked databases such as the World Wide Web. There is a common confusion, however, between data retrieval, document retrieval, information retrieval, and text retrieval, and each of these has its own bodies of literature, theory, praxis and technologies. IR is, like most nascent fields, interdisciplinary, based on computer science, mathematics, library science, information science, cognitive psychology, linguistics, statistics, physics.","Automated IR systems are used to reduce information overload. Many universities and public libraries use IR systems to provide access to books, journals, and other documents. IR systems are often related to object and query. Queries are formal statements of information needs that are put to an IR system by the user. An object is an entity which keeps or stores information in a database. User queries are matched to objects stored in the database. A document is, therefore, a data object. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates.","Information society","Information society is a society in which the creation, distribution, diffusion, use, and manipulation of information is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. The knowledge economy is its economic counterpart whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding.","Specific to this kind of society is the central position information technology has for production, economy, and society at large. Information society is seen as the successor to industrial society. Closely related concepts are the post-industrial society (Daniel Bell), post-fordism, post-modern society, knowledge society, Telematic Society, Information Revolution, and network society (Manuel Castells).","Information systems","Information systems is the discipline concerned with the development, use, application and influence of information technologies. An information system is a technologically implemented medium for recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions, as well as for drawing conclusions from such expressions.","The technology used for implementing information systems by no means has to be computer technology. A notebook in which one lists certain items of interest is, according to that definition, an information system. Likewise, there are computer applications that do not comply with this definition of information systems. Embedded systems are an example. A computer application that is integrated into clothing or even the human body does not generally deal with linguistic expressions. One could, however, try to generalize Langefors' definition so as to cover more recent developments.","Intellectual property","Intellectual property (IP) is a disputed umbrella term for various legal entitlements which attach to certain names, written and recorded media, and inventions. The holders of these legal entitlements are generally entitled to exercise various exclusive rights in relation to the subject matter of the IP. The term intellectual property links the idea that this subject matter is the product of the mind or the intellect together with the political and economical notion of property. The close linking of these two ideas is a matter of some controversy. It is criticized as \"a fad\" by Mark Lemley of Stanford Law School and by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation as an \"overgeneralization\" and \"at best a catch-all to lump together disparate laws.\"[13]","Intellectual property laws and enforcement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There are inter-governmental efforts to harmonize them through international treaties such as the 1994 World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), while other treaties may facilitate registration in more than one jurisdiction at a time. Enforcement of copyright, disagreements over medical and software patents, and the dispute regarding the nature of \"intellectual property\" as a cohesive notion[13] have so far prevented the emergence of a cohesive international system.","Knowledge management","Knowledge management comprises a range of practices used by organizations to identify, create, represent, and distribute knowledge for reuse, awareness, and learning across the organizations.","Knowledge Management programs are typically tied to organizational objectives and are intended to lead to the achievement of specific outcomes, such as shared intelligence, improved performance, competitive advantage, or higher levels of innovation.","Knowledge transfer (one aspect of Knowledge Management) has always existed in one form or another. Examples include on-the-job peer discussions, formal apprenticeship, corporate libraries, professional training, and mentoring programs. However, since the late twentieth century, additional technology has been applied to this task.","Knowledge engineering","Knowledge engineering (KE), often studied in conjunction with knowledge management, refers to the building, maintaining and development of knowledge-based systems. It has a great deal in common with software engineering, and is related to many computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, data mining, expert systems, decision support systems and geographic information systems. Knowledge engineering is also related to mathematical logic, as well as strongly involved in cognitive science and socio-cognitive engineering where the knowledge is produced by socio-cognitive aggregates (mainly humans) and is structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and logic works.","Semantic web","Semantic Web is an evolving extension of the World Wide Web in which web content can be expressed not only in natural language, but also in a form that can be understood, interpreted and used by software agents, thus permitting them to find, share and integrate information more easily.[14] It derives from W3C director Tim Berners-Lee's vision of the Web as a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge exchange.","At its core, the Semantic Web comprises a philosophy,[15] a set of design principles,[16] collaborative working groups, and a variety of enabling technologies. Some elements of the Semantic Web are expressed as prospective future possibilities that have yet to be implemented or realized.[17] Other elements of the Semantic Web are expressed in formal specifications. Some of these include Resource Description Framework (RDF), a variety of data interchange formats (for example, RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, and notations such as RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). All of which are intended to formally describe concepts, terms, and relationships within a given problem domain.","Usability engineering","Usability engineering is a subset of human factors that is specific to computer science and is concerned with the question of how to design software that is easy to use. It is closely related to the field of human-computer interaction and industrial design. The term \"usability engineering\" (UE) (in contrast to other names of the discipline, like interaction design or user experience design) tends to describe a pragmatic approach to user interface design which emphasizes empirical methods and operational definitions of user requirements for tools. Extending as far as International Standards Organization-approved definitions usability is considered a context-dependent agreement of the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which specific users should be able to perform tasks. Advocates of this approach engage in task analysis, then prototype interface designs and conduct usability tests. On the basis of such tests, the technology is (ideally) re-designed or (occasionally) the operational targets for user performance are revised.","User-centered design","User-centered design is a design philosophy and a process in which the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of an interface or document are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. User-centered design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem solving process that not only requires designers to analyze and foresee how users are likely to use an interface, but to test the validity of their assumptions with regards to user behaviour in real world tests with actual users. Such testing is necessary as it is often very difficult for the designers of an interface to understand intuitively what a first-time user of their design experiences, and what each user's learning curve may look like.","The chief difference from other interface design philosophies is that user-centered design tries to optimize the user interface around how people can, want, or need to work, rather than forcing the users to change how they work to accommodate the system or function.","XML","XML is a W3C-recommended general-purpose markup language that supports a wide variety of applications. XML languages or \"dialects\" may be designed by anyone and may be processed by conforming software. XML is also designed to be reasonably human-legible, and to this end, terseness was not considered essential in its structure. XML is a simplified subset of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). Its primary purpose is to facilitate the sharing of data across different information systems, particularly systems connected via the Internet[18] Formally defined languages based on XML (such as RSS, MathML, GraphML, XHTML, Scalable Vector Graphics, MusicXML, and thousands of other examples) allow diverse software to reliably understand information formatted and passed in these languages.","Research","Many universities have entire schools or departments devoted to the study of information science, while numerous information science scholars can be found in disciplines such as communication, law, sociology, computer science, and library science to name a few. (See List of I-Schools and List of library and information science programs.)","Research methods","The contents of books and mass media are analyzed to study how people communicate and the messages people talk or write about.","Case study","A specific set of circumstances or a group (the \"case\") is analyzed according to a specific goal of study. Generally, case studies are used to characterize a trend or development; they have weak generalizability.","Historical method","This involves a continuous and systematic search for the information and knowledge about past events related to the life of a person, a group, society, or the world.","Interviews","The researcher obtains data by interviewing people. If the interview is non-structured, the researcher leaves it to the interviewee (also referred to as the respondent or the informant) to guide the conversation.","Life history","This is the study of the personal life of a person. Through a series of interviews, the researcher can probe into the decisive moments in their life or the various influences on their life.","Longitudinal study","This is an extensive examination of a specific group over a long period of time.","Observation","Using data form the senses, one records information about social phenomenon or behavior. Qualitative research relies heavily on observation, although it is in a highly disciplined form.","Participant observation","As the name implies, the researcher goes to the field (usually a community), lives with the people for some time, and participates in their activities in order to know and feel their culture.","Notes","↑ John Willis Clark, The Care Of Books: An Essay On The Development Of Libraries And Their Fittings, From The Earliest Times To The End Of The Eighteenth Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1901).","↑ Margaret Barton Korty, “Benjamin Franklin and Eighteenth Century American Libraries,” ‘‘Transactions of the American Philosophical Society’’ 55.9 (1965).","↑ F.

Credit: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg","Facebook is shutting down a rich source of third-party consumer data flowing to advertisers as a way to steel up the integrity of the platform following the Cambridge Analytica leak.","On Wednesday, Facebook said it would remove ad targeting options that relied on consumer data from third-parties such as Acxiom, Oracle Data Cloud, Experian, Epsilon, and others. These data providers have some of the deepest insights into consumer behavior across the world—information on what people buy, where they shop, what kind of cars they drive, health profiles, incomes, family makeup—and they are integral to the entire digital ad ecosystem.","\"We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,\" a Facebook spokeswoman said in an e-mail statement. \"This product enables third-party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook.\"","Partner Categories are part of the targeting options within the Facebook ad platform that can help define the audience for an advertiser, and they show how many people could be reached within specific target groups.","The data come from these third-parties, which is why Facebook is shutting them down. Earlier this month, it was discovered that Cambridge Analytica, also a third-party data provider, abused Facebook user data, and may have stored and shared the data against Facebook's policies.","Cambridge Analytica is being investigated in the U.S. and U.K. for allegedly using underhanded tactics to impact the Brexit vote and the 2016 presidential elections. It's also been accused of using its illicit Facebook data to exert untoward influence over voters.","Facebook is waiting on an audit by U.K. authorities to say for sure whether Cambridge Analytica kept its user data despite being told to erase the profiles years ago. Facebook has also been reviewing its internal policies and promised to audit any other third party developers who may have had similar access to data.","The plan to phase out the third-party data providers will not impact Custom Audiences, according to Facebook. Custom Audiences are targeting lists based on data owned by the advertiser.","Some of the third-party data providers also help with measuring ad campaigns, analyzing data like sales impact and brand sentiment. Facebook says they will still be engaged in that work.","Advertisers like consumer goods brands are particularly reliant on this type of third-party data, because they don't have direct lines to collect consumer data when most of the purchases of their products happen at stores they don't own. The third parties can give them valuable consumer insights.","\"For some clients, this is a big part of how they advertise on Facebook,\" says a digital agency executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"But in a way it's fair. If Facebook is being held to account for third-party data collection being turned into targeting on the platform, they either have to audit the collection practices or just say no more. You can't do it on the platform anymore.\"","Meanwhile, rivals like Google, Snapchat and Twitter all have similar third-party targeting tools. Carolyn Everson, Facebook's VP of global ad sales, said last week that the company would try to turn its data deficiency into an advantage by reshaping the conversation around privacy and consumer information online.","\"I think we have an opportunity to lead in the conversation around how consumer data is protected,\" Everson told AdAge in a phone interview last week.","The data troubles and consumer backlash has exposed Facebook in a way that strikes at the heart of its business. Its main source of value is the data machine it built that promises to understand its 2 billion users and target ads in an unprecedented way.","Now advertisers say Facebook is trying to reposition the business, relying less on mining personal information for hyper-targeted ads. It is emphasizing the vast reach of the platform more than just the deep data insights.","\"There is a silver lining for Facebook shutting down access to data,\" says another digital advertiser, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"They are using that as a reason to promote the reach and frequency side of the business like television.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Here is a transcript of that conversation:","Nicholas Thompson: You learned about the Cambridge Analytica breach in late 2015, and you got them to sign a legal document saying the Facebook data they had misappropriated had been deleted. But in the two years since, there were all kinds of stories in the press that could have made one doubt and mistrust them. Why didn’t you dig deeper to see if they had misused Facebook data?","Mark Zuckerberg: So in 2015, when we heard from journalists at The Guardian that Aleksandr Kogan seemed to have shared data with Cambridge Analytica and a few other parties, the immediate actions that we took were to ban Kogan’s app and to demand a legal certification from Kogan and all the other folks who he shared it with. We got those certifications, and Cambridge Analytica had actually told us that they actually hadn’t received raw Facebook data at all. It was some kind of derivative data, but they had deleted it and weren’t [making] any use of it.","In retrospect, though, I think that what you’re pointing out here is one of the biggest mistakes that we made. And that’s why the first action that we now need to go take is to not just rely on certifications that we’ve gotten from developers, but [we] actually need to go and do a full investigation of every single app that was operating before we had the more restrictive platform policies—that had access to a lot of data—and for any app that has any suspicious activity, we’re going to go in and do a full forensic audit. And any developer who won’t sign up for that we’re going to kick off the platform. So, yes, I think the short answer to this is that's the step that I think we should have done for Cambridge Analytica, and we’re now going to go do it for every developer who is on the platform who had access to a large amount of data before we locked things down in 2014.","NT: OK, great. I did write a piece this week saying I thought that was the main mistake Facebook made.","MZ: The good news here is that the big actions that we needed to take to prevent this from happening today we took three or four years ago. But had we taken them five or six years ago, we wouldn’t be here right now. So I do think early on on the platform we had this very idealistic vision around how data portability would allow all these different new experiences, and I think the feedback that we’ve gotten from our community and from the world is that privacy and having the data locked down is more important to people than maybe making it easier to bring more data and have different kinds of experiences. And I think if we’d internalized that sooner and had made these changes that we made in 2014 in, say, 2012 or 2010 then I also think we could have avoided a lot of harm.","NT: And that’s a super interesting philosophical change, because what interests me the most about this story is that there are hard tradeoffs in everything. The critique of Facebook two weeks ago was that you need to be more open with your data, and now it’s that certain data needs to be closed off. You can encrypt data more, but if you encrypt data more it makes it less useful. So tell me the other philosophical changes that have been going through your mind during the past 72 hours as you’ve been digging into this.","MZ: Well that’s the big one, but I think that that’s been decided pretty clearly at this point. I think the feedback that we’ve gotten from people—not only in this episode but for years—is that people value having less access to their data above having the ability to more easily bring social experiences with their friends’ data to other places. And I don’t know, I mean, part of that might be philosophical, it may just be in practice what developers are able to build over the platform, and the practical value exchange, that’s certainly been a big one. And I agree. I think at the heart of a lot of these issues we face are tradeoffs between real values that people care about. You know, when you think about issues like fake news or hate speech, right, it’s a tradeoff between free speech and free expression and safety and having an informed community. These are all the challenging situations that I think we are working to try to navigate as best we can.","NT: So is it safe to assume that, as you went through the process over the past few days, you’ve been talking about the tradeoffs, looking at a wide range of solutions, and you picked four or five of them that are really good, that are solid, that few people are going to dispute? But that there’s a whole other suite of changes that are more complicated that we may hear about from you in the next few weeks?","MZ: There are definitely other things that we’re thinking about that are longer term. But there’s also a lot of nuance on this, right? So there are probably 15 changes that we’re making to the platform to further restrict data, and I didn’t list them all, because a lot of them are kind of nuanced and hard to explain—so I kind of tried to paint in broad strokes what the issues are, which were first, going forward, making sure developers can’t get access to this kind of data. The good news there is that the most important changes there had been made in 2014. But there are still several other things that, upon examination, it made sense to do now. And then the other is just that we want to make sure that there aren’t other Cambridge Analyticas out there. And if they were able to skate by giving us, say, fraudulent legal certification, I just think our responsibility to our community is greater than to just rely on that from a bunch of different actors who might have signals, as you say, of doing suspicious things. So I think our responsibility is to now go and look at every single app and to, any time there’s anything suspicious, get into more detail and do a full audit of them. Those, I think, are the biggest pieces.","NT: Got it. We’re learning a lot every day about Cambridge Analytica, and we’re learning what they did. How confident are you that Facebook data didn’t get into the hands of Russian operatives—into the Internet Research Agency, or even into other groups that we may not have found yet?","MZ: I can’t really say that. I hope that we will know that more certainly after we do an audit. You know, for what it’s worth on this, the report in 2015 was that Kogan had shared data with Cambridge Analytica and others. When we demanded the certification from Cambridge Analytica, what they came back with was saying: Actually, we never actually received raw Facebook data. We got maybe some personality scores or some derivative data from Kogan, but actually that wasn’t useful in any of the models, so we’d already deleted it and weren't using it in anything. So yes, we’ll basically confirm that we’ll fully expunge it all and be done with this.","So I’m not actually sure where this is going to go. I certainly think the New York Times and Guardian and Channel 4 reports that we received last week suggested that Cambridge Analytica still had access to the data. I mean, those sounded credible enough that we needed to take major action based on it. But, you know, I don’t want to jump to conclusions about what is going to be turned up once we complete this audit. And the other thing I’d say is that we have temporarily paused the audit to cede to the UK regulator, the ICO [Information Commissioner's Office], so that they can do a government investigation—I think it might be a criminal investigation, but it’s a government investigation at a minimum. So we’ll let them go first. But we certainly want to make sure that we understand how all this data was used and fully confirm that no Facebook community data is out there.","NT: But presumably there’s a second level of analysis you could do, which would be to look at the known stuff from the Internet Research Agency, to look at data signatures from files you know Kogan had, and to see through your own data, not through the audited data, whether there’s a potential that that information was passed to the IRA. Is that investigation something that’s ongoing?","MZ: You know, we’ve certainly looked into the IRA’s ad spending and use in a lot of detail. The data that Kogan’s app got, it wasn’t watermarked in any way. And if he passed along data to Cambridge Analytica that was some kind of derivative data based on personality scores or something, we wouldn’t have known that, or ever seen that data. So it would be hard to do that analysis. But we’re certainly looking into what the IRA did on an ongoing basis. The more important thing, though, that I think we’re doing there is just trying to make the sure government has all the access to the content that they need. So they've given us certain warrants, we’re cooperating as much as we can with those investigations, and my view, at least, is that the US government and special counsel are going to have a much broader view of all the different signals in the system than we’re going to—including, for example, money transfers and things like that that we just won’t have access to be able to understand. So I think that that’s probably the best bet of coming up with a link like that. And nothing that we’ve done internally so far has found a link—doesn’t mean that there isn’t one—but we haven’t identified any.","NT: Speaking of Congress, there are a lot of questions about whether you will go and testify voluntarily, or whether you’ll be asked in a more formal sense than a tweet. Are you planning to go?","MZ: So, here’s how we think about this. Facebook regularly testifies before Congress on a number of topics, most of which are not as high profile as the Russia investigation one recently. And our philosophy on this is: Our job is to get the government and Congress as much information as we can about anything that we know so they have a full picture, across companies, across the intelligence community, they can put that together and do what they need to do. So, if it is ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that. But the reason why we haven’t done that so far is because there are people at the company whose full jobs are to deal with legal compliance or some of these different things, and they’re just fundamentally more in the details on those things. So as long as it’s a substantive testimony where what folks are trying to get is as much content as possible, I’m not sure when I’ll be the right person. But I would be happy to if I were.","NT: OK. When you think about regulatory models, there’s a whole spectrum. There are kind of simple, limited things, like the Honest Ads Act, which would be more openness on ads. There’s the much more intense German model, or what France has certainly talked about. Or there's the ultimate extreme, like Sri Lanka, which just shut social media down. So when you think about the different models for regulation, how do you think about what would be good for Facebook, for its users, and for civic society?","MZ: Well, I mean, I think you’re framing this the right away, because the question isn’t “Should there be regulation or shouldn’t there be?” It’s “How do you do it?” And some of the ones, I think, are more straightforward. So take the Honest Ads Act. Most of the stuff in there, from what I’ve seen, is good. We support it. We’re building full ad transparency tools; even though it doesn’t necessarily seem like that specific bill is going to pass, we’re going to go implement most of it anyway. And that’s just because I think it will end up being good for our community and good for the internet if internet services live up to a lot of the same standards, and even go further than TV and traditional media have had to in advertising—that just seems logical.","There are some really nuanced questions, though, about how to regulate which I think are extremely interesting intellectually. So the biggest one that I’ve been thinking about is this question of: To what extent should companies have a responsibility to use AI tools to kind of self-regulate content? Here, let me kind of take a step back on this. When we got started in 2004 in a dorm room, there were two big differences about how we governed content on the service. Basically, back then people shared stuff and then they flagged it and we tried to look at it. But no one was saying, \"Hey, you should be able to proactively know every time someone posts something bad,\" because the AI tech was much less evolved, and we were a couple of people in a dorm room. So I think people understood that we didn’t have a full operation that can go deal with this. But now you fast-forward almost 15 years and AI is not solved, but it is improving to the point where we can proactively identify a lot of content—not all of it, you know; some really nuanced hate speech and bullying, it’s still going to be years before we can get at—but, you know, nudity, a lot of terrorist content, we can proactively determine a lot of the time. And at the same time we’re a successful enough company that we can employ 15,000 people to work on security and all of the different forms of community [operations]. So I think there’s this really interesting question of: Now that companies increasingly over the next five to 10 years, as AI tools get better and better, will be able to proactively determine what might be offensive content or violate some rules, what therefore is the responsibility and legal responsibility of companies to do that? That, I think, is probably one of the most interesting intellectual and social debates around how you regulate this. I don’t know that it’s going to look like the US model with Honest Ads or any of the specific models that you brought up, but I think that getting that right is going to be one of the key things for the internet and AI going forward.","NT: So how does government even get close to getting that right, given that it takes years to make laws and then they’re in place for more years, and AI will be completely different in two years from what it is now? Do they just set you guidelines? Do they require a certain amount of transparency? What can be done, or what can the government do, to help guide you in this process?","MZ: I actually think it’s both of the things that you just said. So I think what tends to work well are transparency, which I think is an area where we need to do a lot better and are working on that and are going to have a number of big announcements this year, over the course of the year, about transparency around content. And I think guidelines are much better than dictating specific processes.","So my understanding with food safety is there’s a certain amount of dust that can get into the chicken as it’s going through the processing, and it’s not a large amount—it needs to be a very small amount—and I think there’s some understanding that you’re not going to be able to fully solve every single issue if you’re trying to feed hundreds of millions of people—or, in our case, build a community of 2 billion people—but that it should be a very high standard, and people should expect that we’re going to do a good job getting the hate speech out. And that, I think, is probably the right way to do it—to give companies the right flexibility in how to execute that. I think when you start getting into micromanagement, of “Oh, you need to have this specific queue or this,” which I think what you were saying is the German model—you have to handle hate speech in this way—in some ways that’s actually backfired. Because now we are handling hate speech in Germany in a specific way, for Germany, and our processes for the rest of the world have far surpassed our ability to handle, to do that. But we’re still doing it in Germany the way that it’s mandated that we do it there. So I think guidelines are probably going to be a lot better. But this, I think, is going to be an interesting conversation to have over the coming years, maybe, more than today. But it’s going to be an interesting question.","NT: Last question. You’ve had a lot of big changes: The meaningful interactions was a huge change; the changes in the ways that you’ve found and stopped the spread of misinformation; the changes today, in the way you work with developers. Big changes, right. Lots of stuff happening. When you think back at how you set up Facebook, are there things, choices, directional choices, you wish you had done a little differently that would have prevented us from being in this situation?","MZ: I don’t know; that’s tough. To some degree, if the community—if we hadn’t served a lot of people, then I think that some of this stuff would be less relevant. But that’s not a change I would want to go back and reverse. You know, I think the world is changing quickly. And I think social norms are changing quickly, and people’s definitions around what is hate speech, what is false news—which is a concept people weren’t as focused on before a couple of years ago—people’s trust and fear of governments and different institutions is rapidly evolving, and I think when you’re trying to build services for a community of 2 billion people all over the world, with different social norms, I think it’s pretty unlikely that you can navigate that in a way where you’re not going to face some thorny tradeoffs between values, and need to shift and adjust your systems, and do a better job on a lot of stuff. So I don’t begrudge that. I think that we have a serious responsibility. I want to make sure that we take it as seriously as it should be taken. I’m grateful for the feedback that we get from journalists who criticize us and teach us important things about what we need to do, because we need to get this right. It’s important. There’s no way that sitting in a dorm in 2004 you’re going to solve everything upfront. It’s an inherently iterative process, so I don’t tend to look at these things as: Oh, I wish we had not made that mistake. I mean, of course I wish we didn’t make the mistakes, but it wouldn’t be possible to avoid the mistakes. It’s just about, how do you learn from that and improve things and try to serve the community going forward?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history.","The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"","\"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\"","Christopher Wylie, who helped found the data firm Cambridge Analytica and worked there until 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"","(Andrew Testa/New York Times)","Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a written statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","\"This was a scam — and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, told The Times earlier Friday.","He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","A video grab from footage broadcast by the UK Parliament's Parliamentary Recording Unit shows Chief Executive, Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, giving evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of members of parliament on the subject of fake news at the Houses of Parliament in February in London.","(AFP/Getty Images)","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators, who are scrutinizing possible data privacy violations and allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\"","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\"","Reading voters' minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Through a spokeswoman, Bannon declined to comment.","Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win.","When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email.","\"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote.","Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew -- a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs -- more than $800,000 -- and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users -- those who participated in the survey -- had consented to having their data harvested.","An international effort","Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \"personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\" Nix \"never had any strategic or operational role\" in a U.S. election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company's U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees' roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica's political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump's re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age -- a \"Math Man,\" he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.","Wednesday's announcement follows revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for \"some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\"","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page.","Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding \"clearer explanations\" about how its privacy controls work.","Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, called the new settings \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns.","Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.","To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called \"access your information,\" a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That's where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.","Cox said that while the changes are \"in line with the principle of GDPR,\" there's also a \"bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\"","Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy, but gave no further details."],"isopubdate":""}

The firms’ employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant.","Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London.","The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States — and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters’ behavior.","Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what — or which client — prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin’s popularity to Russian expansionism.","On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia. In both documents, the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients, with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm’s elections division. In a statement, SCL said an employee had done “commercial work” about 25 years ago “for a private company in Russia.”","Image","President Vladimir V.

While Mr. Nix’s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference, Democrats on the committee want a fuller review. “It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica,” they said in a report this month.","Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm’s commercial division “discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.” The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.","Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.","“We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,” he wrote in response to a question from The Times. “Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.”","But Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company’s voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters.","“I remember being super confused,” said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.","“I kept asking Alexander, ‘Can you explain to me what they want?’” he said, referring to Mr. Nix. “I don’t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.”","“We’re sending them stuff about political targeting — they then come and ask more about political targeting,” Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil “just didn’t seem to be interested” in how the techniques could be used commercially.","Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.","A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie’s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.","Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, has met with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership.","Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Firm Aiding Trump Had a Link to Russia.

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

I yearn for new experiences and deep connections with people. I’m adaptable, but to a fault; I rarely see danger ahead. I’m capable of infidelity without much remorse. I’m also great at ceramics.","So says Meet Yourself As You Really Are, the oldest, longest, and WTF-est personality quiz I’ve taken. Published in 1936, Meet Yourself is a 336-page home-psychoanalysis test that promises to “‘X-ray’ the reader’s fundamental character.” It does so with an interminable line of questions both probing and random. Are your parents dead? Have you ever had the sensation of standing outside your own body? Do Mickey Mouse cartoons freak you out? What do you think of unskimmed milk?","As you tally “yes” and “no” answers, the book directs you to new sections based on your responses. Somewhere in the middle, you’re categorized as one of 15 rivers—the Nile, Seine, Thames, Missouri, and so on—and eventually you’re offered long-winded personality breakdowns. “As you travel across the network of questions and data by your private track, your story unfolds and your character is explained,” the introduction teases. The book has been described as a Freudian Choose Your Own Adventure, which is accurate enough: It’s like Give Yourself Goosebumps, but instead of escaping the Carnival of Horrors at the end, you learn that you have commitment problems.","Clearly, personality quizzes have some sort of perennial appeal. Facebook newsfeeds are filled with BuzzFeed quizzes and other oddball questionnaires that tell you which city you should actually live in, which ousted Arab Spring ruler you are, and which Hogwarts house you belong in. But these new online quizzes have a dark edge that their analog predecessors didn’t. In the wake of the U.S. election, a secretive data firm hired by Donald Trump’s campaign boasted that it has been using quizzes for years to gather personal information about millions of voters. Its goal: the creation of digital profiles that can predict—and possibly exploit—Americans’ values, anxieties, and political leanings.","Whether this firm, Cambridge Analytica, has actually used predictive profiles to influence people isn’t certain; reports suggest it hasn’t, at least not directly. But the company’s methods nonetheless expose the growing scale of personality analysis online—and the dangers that come with it. On the internet, anything you do is like taking a personality quiz: Everywhere you click reveals something about you. And you’re not the only one who sees the results.","On Meet Yourself’s spine, a silver-painted mirror depicts the personality quiz’s allure: See yourself as you really are. What happens when the mirror is two-way?","* * *","No one seems to know when the personality quiz first gained a foothold in popular culture. The journalist Sarah Laskow has traced its origin in America at least as far back as the late 19th century, “when ladies’ magazines started gaining traction and the yellow press would try anything to sell papers.” But the quiz has persisted with remarkable consistency since, with spikes in popularity during a quick magazine boom immediately post-WWII, the Cosmopolitan quizzes of the 1960s and ’70s, and today’s ubiquitous BuzzFeed quizzes.","This stretch neatly overlaps with the history of the popular quiz’s buttoned-up, high-achieving sibling: the personality test. In-depth psychological assessments like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator began popping up in the first half of the 20th century for the purpose of scanning and sorting employees in industrial workplaces. While many of these tests, including the Myers-Briggs, have since been dismissed by the scientific community as unreliable—if not dangerously discriminatory—they, too, have persisted, perhaps in part because they at least provide a framework for otherwise-difficult office conversations. Somewhere around 10,000 companies, 2,500 colleges and universities, and 200 government agencies still use the Myers-Briggs in the U.S. today, including the majority of Fortune 500 companies.","Affiliation with these more legitimate-seeming forms of personality analysis has always given the personality quiz a vague air of authority. Indeed, if there’s any one way to characterize quizzes’ mystique, it’s probably that, through all their many iterations, they have somehow managed to tightrope-walk the line between entertainment and science, or at least something approaching science. “BuzzFeed quizzes are crafted to create the illusion of truth, or potential truth,” writes the journalist Caroline O’Donovan, in explaining the fad. She quotes Summer Anne Burton, one of BuzzFeed’s editors: “You sort of write them like horoscopes, with tidbits people can relate to.”","Meet Yourself discovered this strategy long before today’s click-miners. The book’s co-authors, the British novelist William Gerhardie and the Spanish aristocrat Prince Leopold Loewenstein—whose son, incidentally, went on to be the financial manager of the Rolling Stones—flip freely between promises of profound insights and guarantees of fun.","If the limited information out there about the book’s critical reception is any indication, people have never taken Meet Yourself too seriously. A short review in a March 1937 issue of Ohio’s Piqua Daily Call deems it “a fairly amusing way of filling in an odd hour or so,” and includes this sick 1930s burn: “If you sit down prayerfully with it and answer all of its impertinent questions, you will never again be phased by any little thing like an income tax or civil service examination blank.” Decades later, a columnist for The Independent ran into the book on a trip with her boyfriend to her parents’ house, and cracked up when it announced to the family that the boyfriend was “a conqueror of women.”","As BuzzFeed’s quizzes really started gaining steam a few years ago, a deluge of think-pieces attempted to make sense of why people just can’t get enough of them, even when they clearly have little to do with reality. Reasons included narcissism, existential searching, and boredom. Laskow made the case that people simply like talking about themselves. These probably are all true, to some extent. But they overlook something deeper about the nature of personality itself.","* * *","Simine Vazire believes that a good personality test rarely tells you anything you don’t already know. As director of the Personality and Self-Knowledge Lab at the University of California, Davis, she studies how people come to understand who they are. “We know a lot just by being in our bodies, by being ourselves,” she says. Tests promising to unveil hidden truths about their takers—tests known as projective in psychology—are mostly bogus.","What tests offer instead, Vazire suggests, is reflection. “When you have someone summarize to you what you just told them, it gives you a sense of, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s what I was trying to say.’ I think this is just a version of that,” she says. “Because you’re talking about yourself, and you’re answering a bunch of questions about yourself, a test can summarize this information for you. It can give you a precise or better language for summarizing yourself, even if it’s based on what you told it.”","This reflection isn’t the quasi-mystical type of self-knowledge Meet Yourself claims to be after. It doesn’t show you as you really are, but rather helps you articulate who you know yourself to be.","That distinction might sound trivial, but it actually makes a critical point about how personality functions. In its textbook definition, personality is all about patterns: “individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving,” as the American Psychological Association puts it. Personality, in other words, is not some set thing. It’s the result of a messy web of tendencies and habits, all informed by some incalculable mix of biology, disposition, and learned behavior.","That makes personality slippery. While psychologists debate the granular details of its definition, what it amounts to is that personality is something of a paradox. People tend to have a sense of their own character, but this sense is never complete. We know ourselves, but we don’t.","This is why people love personality quizzes. Beyond vanity and narcissism and harmless fun, taking a personality quiz helps me get out of my own head, to see whether my experience of myself matches up with how others experience me. This is the same reason I sometimes catch myself staring into the mirror even after I’ve double-checked that my fly is zipped and fretted over my oh-so-slightly thinning hair. There’s an element of affirmation, even awe and wonder, to the reflection. That is me in the world.","In this light, personality quizzes actually appear pretty beneficial, or at least innocuous. And maybe they would be, if they left me to my own musings and no one else ever saw the results. But a psychological need for self-reflection gets complicated when the mirror also snatches up information for other people to use.","* * *","In 2008, Michal Kosinski joined a research project that helped revolutionize how data about people is collected. As a graduate student in Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre, a department that studies online psychological assessment, he and his classmate David Stillwell distributed a short personality quiz on Facebook that told people how they rated among psychology’s “big five” personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN, for short). Upon receiving their results, quiz-takers had the option of sharing their Facebook profiles with Kosinski and Stillwell.","It didn’t take long for the two researchers to amass the largest-ever collection of psychometric scores paired with Facebook profiles. “It was surprisingly easy to get people engaged,” says Kosinski, who’s now a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford’s graduate school of business. “[Stillwell] just sent it to his friends on Facebook. Those friends took the questionnaire, then shared it on their profiles, and suddenly you had thousands of people taking it every day.” Over a few years, Kosinski and Stillwell gathered info from millions of Facebook users.","The two researchers used this data to build a new system for predicting people’s personalities. With access to their subjects’ OCEAN traits and Facebook information side by side, Kosinski was able to correlate what people were like with the personal details available about them online—Facebook likes, gender, age, and so on. Soon, he had an algorithm that, based on analyzing Facebook likes alone, could guess how people think, feel, and act—that messy web of tendencies and habits—with startling accuracy. With 70 likes, the model could predict someone’s personality, as measured by a 100-question personality test, better than that person’s friends could. With 300 likes, it could outperform a husband or wife.","This predictive approach pioneered by Kosinski is what stirred up so much controversy in the U.S. election. Kosinski himself had nothing to do with the data firm hired by Trump’s campaign. Motherboard and Das Magazin have reported that his research appears to have been brought over to Cambridge Analytica by a young colleague of his with ties to the firm’s parent company, the London-based Strategic Communication Laboratories Group, or SCL. (Cambridge Analytica denies that the company or its methodologies have any connection to Kosinski.) After the election, the firm first declared that its brand of “psychographic” profiling played a major role in Trump’s victory, then conceded that it never actually used the approach to influence voters.","Whatever the impact so far, predictive methods like Kosinski’s and Cambridge Analytica’s are pushing open the door to a new—and unsettling—stage of personality analysis. It’s no revelation that personal data can be collected online, and there are already plenty of ways this data can be used to influence people: In politics, for instance, Barack Obama targeted individual voters with psychometrics well before Cambridge Analytica was even formed. But Kosinski saw just how much information can be gained. With personality quizzes, he found what might be the most direct route into people’s hearts and minds yet.","Kosinski never requires Facebook users to give up their profiles to take his quizzes. But the worrying implication of his kind of approach is that online personality analysis can easily blur the line between opting in and opting out. When algorithms can be trained to accurately infer your personality based on anything you do, the internet is a personality quiz—or, at least, it can be, so long as each page visit, web search, and “like” can be gathered and correlated.","Online, before you even click on a quiz, you’re already filling something out.","* * *","There are a lot of good reasons to worry about this technology. Imagine an advertising company that knows you’re self-conscious about your weight, so tries to sell you diet pills. Or—in a hypothetical that often comes up in this kind of discussion—imagine a political campaign that knows you’re prone to anxiety, so targets you with ads about the dangers of the Islamic State. “Big data companies already know your age, income, favorite cereal and when you last voted,” notes a New York Times report on Cambridge Analytica. “But the company that can perfect psychological targeting could offer far more potent tools: the ability to manipulate behavior by understanding how someone thinks and what he or she fears.”","While Kosinski thinks people’s rapidly diminishing privacy online is indeed dangerous, he’s quick to point out that there are potential benefits to personality profiling, too. Targeted ad campaigns could get kids to quit smoking, he suggests. Personalized political messages could inform voters, not pull their strings.","Companies like Cambridge Analytica have a commercial stake in exaggerating their techniques’ reach, as well. “What they’re selling is not exactly snake oil, though it can work as a placebo for panicky candidates who are down in the polls with weeks to go before Election Day,” the journalist Leonid Bershidsky has argued. “But just like artificial intelligence or, say, the blockchain, [data science has yet to produce] killer apps that can ensure a political victory or business success.”","I’m not convinced the nerdy podcasts and obscure track-and-field clubs I like on Facebook will hand the reins of my life to some shadowy corporation anytime soon. But I do think the threat is real—real enough, at least, that I wouldn’t give away my profile information for a personality assessment.","Something Kosinski told me gave me an uneasy feeling I haven’t been able to shake, too. There’s research that has been done on people’s trust in algorithms. A subject talks to an expert on a topic, and the expert offers some sort of insight on that topic, backed by one of two possible justifications: either a) the expert has thought about this for a long time, or b) the expert’s computer calculated the solution. The results show that people are more likely to trust the computer. “We’re being trained by algorithms that they’re always right,” Kosinski says.","Surely, such trust isn’t always misplaced. Vazire, the UC Davis psychologist, admits that she’d probably trust an algorithm over an expert—if she knew the algorithm to be accurate. But what if it’s not? What if, say, it’s built upon data collected by researchers who are prone to error and bias? Or what if it’s intentionally incorrect—sneakily incorrect? Conceivably, an algorithm could know so much about you that it could say exactly what would make you think, act, or feel a certain way.","That’s where the impulse to take a personality quiz keeps me up at night. I’m wired to seek out ways to reflect on who I am, but who I am is slippery—and that makes me open to suggestions. If people’s faith in algorithms continues to grow, it might not be long before I trust a computer to tell me about my personality more than I trust friends or family—or more than I trust myself."],"isopubdate":"2017-07-13"}

A two-year long PR crisis has come to a head, and Facebook is facing some serious backlash. So the question is, how can Facebook win back the hearts -- and more importantly the trust -- of millions?","As it stands right now, Facebook staunchly believes itself to be a platform -- but what it really needs to be is a brand. Brands fight for our business, and they do so by fighting for our attention. And as a result, brands have personality. Brands make us love them. And that’s the action Zuckerberg needs to take.","Think about the companies we all love: Apple, Amazon, Tesla. These brands have purpose, they have meaning -- they have created relationships with their consumers. And that relationship is what keeps the public loyal, even in the face of a communications hiccup. (And yes, we are all aware that playing a questionable role in a major election is more than a hiccup … but still.)","Apple is an omnipresent brand, but it is by no means a perfect brand. It's publicly confirmed it slows down batteries of older models. Yet here we are, still carrying our iPhones, looking for chargers. Because at this point, going non-Apple just really isn’t an option.","That’s the beauty of “brand.” It breeds loyalty. It has longevity. It attracts love.","Brands tell a story. They make the consumer feel things. They forge a personal connection. But, Facebook has always focused on the service, not on the emotion. And yes, its product is functional, but that doesn’t mean it has to eschew the connection. No service is more functional than Amazon, but its brand is full of connection. Just look at its Super Bowl commercials. They were fun, heartwarming, engaging -- and they were also a great PR effort for Jeff Bezos. The ads humanize a utilitarian brand, creating affinity and loyalty among consumers.","Steve Jobs was the inspirational, intelligent and beloved CEO who made it seem that, more than anything, he cared about moving society forward. Apple’s goal was making your life better, easier, more efficient, more fun -- and consumers loved that idea.","Once Jobs was gone, Elon Musk wanted to take on this role. And through tireless efforts, he’s successfully filled those grey New Balance sneakers. Zuckerberg, on the other hand, hasn’t tried to enter this space. And now, it’s biting him in the you-know-where.","Tesla and SpaceX have had plenty of production issues. Potential bad press follows Musk around like a bad boyfriend, but we still love him and his companies. And that’s because he’s able to create a narrative of innovation and inspiration that consumers and investors are always willing to stand behind. He mystifies them. He charms them. He makes them fall in love with him. He's got a bit of a P.T. Barnum effect, actually.","And that’s what Zuckerberg is missing.","Facebook is at a pivotal point in its history. Currently, if we’re talking about its relationship status with the public, “it’s complicated.” But, with the right personification and branding, it can get back in the public’s good graces despite the information crisis, and people will keep sending \"friend requests\" and tagging photos. Just like people keep buying iPhones.","So, what needs to change? Right now, Facebook’s brand communications are entirely transactional. Zuckerberg tells us what is happening but not why it’s happening. And as a result, people view the brand from a place of utility. Nobody loves Facebook; they just use Facebook. It’s a product, not a brand. And if the platform is going to survive this PR nightmare, it needs people to feel a legitimate and emotional connection to it. It can’t just count on consumers using Facebook because it’s convenient; they need people to love using Facebook.","Facebook needs to take its consumers on a journey, one that paints an inspirational and powerful vision of the future. It needs to create a narrative that makes Facebook an integral part of a better tomorrow. It needs to feel helpful, but human. It needs a brand story. It needs a bit of Barnum.","And it shouldn’t be hard to do! Facebook -- as a platform, as a brand, as whatever you want it to be -- is already about “making the world a better place by connecting people.” That’s a powerful message that consumers can get behind.","But now, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica crisis, we’re seeing what happens when the world doesn’t get better by connecting people. And since Facebook hasn’t spent time telling us a powerful narrative about the good side of connecting people, we’re primed to believe and to become easily swayed by the bad side.","It’s time for Facebook to realize that it is a brand. And then, for it to begin acting as such. It needs to invest time and effort into making people love them.","It’s time for Facebook to change the narrative and turn its story into something positive.","If Zuckerberg wants to save his company, he needs to strike an emotional chord. He needs to earn his consumers' trust. He needs to create a future-looking brand story, one that makes Facebook feel important and inspirational -- and imperative.","He needs to take us back to 2008, when we were all constantly changing our profile pictures and friending everyone we met. Back to poke wars and 60-photo albums, and afternoons spent writing on people’s walls.","He needs to make us fall in love with Facebook all over again.","More from Entrepreneur","Are paying too much for business insurance?

{"originalurl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16683603","title":"ICE uses Facebook data to find and track immigrants | Hacker News","text":["Title is misleading. ICE is actually two organizations under a single umbrella. There’s Enforcmenet and Removal Operations (which is what people commonly associate with ICE) and there’s Homeland Security Investigations. The article is about HSI. HSI doesn’t “track immigrants” (that’s the ERO), they track criminals. Smugglers, people traffickers, etc.","ERO and HSI are different directorates under the same organization. Confusing two departments of an organization for being two different organizations is like saying a programming team and QA team of a software development company are two different organizations.","The statements above simply don’t imply that “ICE uses Facebook data to track immigrants”. Now as twelveoz pointed it out, a document linked to the article contains information that would imply that, but that information is not included in the body of the article. Whether a department counts as an organization or not is a semantic argument.","Sure, as long as we apply this principle evenly. People who break the speed limit aren’t “speeders,” they’re “illegal drivers.” Forgot to declare some Bitcoin to the IRS? You’re not mildly negligent, you’re an “illegal crypto currency trader”!","Very few people dispute that countries have the right to control their borders. But that doesn’t mean countries have the right to do whatever they want in order to do so, any more than a country’s right to punish murderers means the police can randomly search people’s houses to look for murderers.","It is applied fairly evenly, despite how many people try to frame it. Online piracy is often referred to as \"illegal downloading/filesharing\". People selling fentanyl aren't referred to as \"unauthorized pharmacists\" but \"illegal drug dealers.\" And speeding isn't \"illegal driving.\" When you're speeding, it's not the act of driving itself that's illegal. It's the speed violation, which is often referred to as illegally speeding or illegally exceeding the speed limit. Illegally driving would involve either driving without a license or driving a stolen vehicle. Illegal immigration involves actively violating the law in order to gain access or maintain access to another country. The argument over what term is appropriate is bikeshedding.","Maybe you should take that up with the fellow who started the argument? And I don't understand why you'd state this after arguing a bunch about the appropriate term.","Your examples are good, but do you have any that aren't crimes? Entering the US without authorization is a crime, but staying without authorization is merely a civil infraction. The majority of \"illegal immigrants\" fall into the second category. Driving without a license is a crime, so a more apt analogy would be parking where it's not allowed. It may sound hyperbolic to compare an immigration violation to a parking ticket, but that is what the law says. We don't call people \"illegal parkers\" when they park where it's not allowed. Other analogous violations might be trying to take a prohibited item through airport security (\"illegal passengers\"?) or violating a building code (a builder who deliberately and frequently does this might well be referred to as an \"illegal builder\").","Interesting side note: in addition to confusing the issue enormously when it comes to the seemingly straightforward \"illegal immigrants are criminals by definition\" argument, the fact that it's only a civil infraction to be in the country without authorization means that there is no right to a public defender. People without the means to hire a lawyer or the luck to find one who will represent them for free get the joyous experience of representing themselves.","I was hoping the arguments here would be about legality of ICE getting access to (private) Facebook data and how users are unknowingly handing over their life.","Executing a search warrant on an individual (assuming criminal) is understandable, but how do you defend - 'the company developed a special system for ICE to access a vast “ecosystem” of data to facilitate immigration officials in both discovering targets and then creating and administering cases against them.'","This sounds like violation of 4th amendment rights. Also, how is this any different than surveillance?","Further these tools could be used in targeting a particular group(s) of people.\n1. It appears to be a framework that creates list of people that can be targeted.\n2. Then they request almost any data to Facebook and Facebook hands it over promptly\n3. Then they 'administer cases' based on this data.","At this moment, this entire apparatus is targeting 'illegal immigrants'","'The report reveals that from January 2017 through June 2017, Facebook received 32,716 requests for data from 52,280 users. Facebook notes in its report that it complied with 85 percent of the requests and “approximately 57% of legal process we received from authorities in the U.S. was accompanied by a non-disclosure order legally prohibiting us from notifying the affected users.”'","32k requests for 52k users, sounds like a bulk data request potentially being served to Facebook. This is in line with the FISA fiasco that happened few years ago.","Facebook is unfortunately complicit in creation of any 'lists' (I do realize that Facebook is in itself a list)","Overall, the rhetoric (in this case anti-immigrant) coupled with unfettered access to Facebook data and palantir data analytics are digital weapons that can be/are used to target large swaths of people.","People were afraid of 'knock down the door style mass deportations', apparently all they have to do is ask Facebook for help."],"isopubdate":""}

(Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)","But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.","Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.","He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”","Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”","Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”","Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.","“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”","Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.","Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.","But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.","“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”","He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”","The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.","The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.","“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.","The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.","In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)","“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”","Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were alarmed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.","“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”","Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.","He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.","“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”","Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, including Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.","“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off.

Facebook plans to roll out the change in the coming weeks.","Facebook users will be able to adjust an array of privacy settings on the page for the information that they’ve given the platform, like their interests, and their activity on Facebook, such as liking photos and commenting on friends' statuses.","Users will also be able to more easily see what data can and can’t be shared with apps.","The new page comes as a response to the massive backlash since it revealed that Cambridge Analytica, which has been linked to the Trump campaign and the Brexit vote in the U.K., had taken the data of 50 million Facebook users without their permission.","Lawmakers and members of the public have criticized Facebook for the volume of data it collects on its users and how few controls it has over how third parties use the data.","“Last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies and help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” wroteErin Egan, Facebook vice president and chief privacy officer of policy, and Ashlie Beringer, Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel.","“We’re taking additional steps in the coming weeks to put people more in control of their privacy. Most of these updates have been in the works for some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance,” they wrote.","Facebook said it plans to announce new policy changes in the coming weeks covering what data it collects and how it uses it.","The social media company is currently facing intense scrutiny from lawmakers on the matter. The Senate Judiciary and House Energy and Commerce committees have both formally invited Zuckerberg to publicly testify before legislators. Lawmakers in other committees have also called for Zuckerberg to testify.","Zuckerberg has reportedly decided that he will make the trip to Washington to appear before Congress."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}
{"originalurl":"http://learn-digital-marketing.com/facebook-makes-its-privacy-data-downloading-and-deletion-settings-easier-to-find/","title":"Facebook makes its privacy, data downloading and deletion settings easier to find - Learn Digital Marketing","text":["With Facebook facing a wave of public backlash over how it has handled user data over the years — a backlash that was kicked off two weeks ago with the revelation that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had worked on targeted election campaigns using personal and private Facebook data — the company today announced a new set of changes to help users find and change their privacy settings, as well as download and delete whatever data has been collected through Facebook’s network of social media services.","To be clear, many of these settings and features already existed in Facebook, but now Facebook is making them significantly clearer for the average user to find and use. It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The social media giant is facing more blowback from users, regulators and investors following reports that its user data was misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that worked for the 2016 Trump presidential campaign.","That has spurred a user boycott, as angry former Facebook users started turning to Twitter over the weekend to express their discontent. David Chartier, a freelance writer in Chicago, was one of them:","\"You can and arguably should #DeleteFacebook,\" Chartier wrote, in response to news that Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling firm, allegedly collected and used data from 50 million Facebook users without their permission.","Chartier's tweet — one of many like it — proved one of his most popular, eliciting 300 retweets and several responses. \"People who have been thinking about it, and they're getting inspired to now, or people who had done it recently\" reached out in support, he says.","Calls for a consumer boycott of Facebook is just one of the company's mounting problems, all stemming from a rapid erosion of public trust. It failed to prevent the dissemination of fake news and misleading ads during the presidential election, and now it appears it failed to keep its users' data safe.","Tavis McGinn says he thinks the unauthorized use of data involves more companies than just Cambridge Analytica.","\"You have to assume that there are many, many other companies who are out there using the data in a similar way,\" he says.","McGinn now has his own research firm called Honest Data, but last year worked for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, conducting reputation research and polling for them. He left after only six months, because he did not like the company's culture, and says Facebook and its executives' reputations have gotten markedly worse since he left.","\"A lot of the damage has already been done, and it is very hard to rebuild trust,\" he says.","The executives are coming under fire for their response. Facebook's data security chief, Alex Stamos, is leaving by August, amid reports of discord among executives over to handle its many problems.","Motley Fool analyst Jason Moser says Facebook executives are hurting its stock price and making its brand problems far worse by not responding to the public outcry.","\"Mark Zuckerberg made his resolution for 2018 to fix the Facebook platform,\" he says. \"Right now, that's getting off to ... a horrendous start.\"","Facebook could not be reached for comment.","Moser says the company is likely to face increased regulatory pressure. On Wednesday, Facebook officials are meeting with congressional staffers. According to news reports, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the incident.","Facebook has grown through acquisition of companies such as Instagram and WhatsApp. But Moser says it isn't likely to win regulators' blessings on any future deals. \"Regulators would put that under the microscope, and give it a very thorough examination, because of what we're seeing right now,\" he says.","Meanwhile, Moser says, the #DeleteFacebook movement speaks to an overall disenchantment among users. He says he informally surveys friends and acquaintances about their recent Facebook use. Every one of them reports having cut back. \"But then it also has to make you wonder, are Facebook's best days behind it?\"","David Chartier, the Chicago writer, says he was inspired to quit Facebook after other friends quit. And now, he says, even more friends are following suit.","\"We just took a little bit of time to talk a different way, maybe we message each other, or some of them use Twitter a little more often, maybe we're even calling each other,\" he says."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House”.","Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday.","In past interviews with Reuters, Parscale has said that Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 Trump campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook’s Grewal said the company was taking the unusual step of announcing the suspension “given the public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica and its parent organization.","The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world’s largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, said in a Twitter post.","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting”, or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and it is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica and two individuals going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data that he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The app was downloaded by about 270,000 people.

That number has dropped to 35% in a new survey Harris administered from March 22 through 26, after a former Cambridge Analytica contractor told the Guardian and the New York Times about the data grab of over 50 million Facebook users.","CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his top-level colleagues also have taken a hit, the survey finds: The share of respondents saying Facebook had excellent leadership dropped from 45% to just 22%.","Zuckerberg recently placed full-page ads in major newspapers apologizing for the “breach of trust” that led to the ongoing scandal. Today, after reportedly resisting calls to appear before lawmakers, the chief executive said he would testify before Congress about the incident.","“Today, companies are recovering faster from crisis, when they occur (perceptually) outside the control of the C-suite,” writes John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, in an email to Fast Company. “In the case of Facebook, the data breach caused their overall reputation to drop by 10% in just three months, but even more worrying is the decline in the public’s perception of Facebook’s leadership and trust.”","Survey participants are giving Facebook lower reputation scores since this past winter.

They were created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation declaring that any “advanced civilization” must fully value the arts, the humanities, and cultural activity.","While the combined annual budgets of both endowments — about $300 million — are a tiny fraction of the $1.1 trillion of total annual discretionary spending, grants from these agencies have been deeply valued financial lifelines and highly coveted honors for artists, musicians, writers and scholars for decades.","Nothing will change for the endowments or other agencies immediately. Congress writes the federal budget, not the president, and White House budget plans are largely political documents that telegraph a president’s priorities.","Image","Jane Chu, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts.CreditCharlotte Kesl for The New York Times","Yet never before have Republicans, who have proposed eliminating the endowments in the past, been so well-positioned to close the agencies, given their control of both houses of Congress and the White House, and now the president’s fiscal plan. Reagan administration officials wanted to slash the endowments at one point, for instance, but they faced a Democratic majority in the House (as well as Reagan friends from Hollywood who favored the endowments).","As for 2017, it is unclear whether Republicans who are friendly to the endowments will fight their own party’s president on their behalf. Mr. Trump went ahead with the proposal even though his daughter Ivanka is a longtime supporter of the arts, and Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, has been a staunch advocate for art therapy for years, being a painter herself.","Endowment leaders — who, as federal officials, do not lobby the White House or Congress — expressed disappointment that their own executive branch was seeking their demise.","“We are greatly saddened to learn of this proposal for elimination, as N.E.H. has made significant contributions to the public good,” said William D. Adams, chairman of the humanities endowment, in a statement.","Mr. Adams made a point of noting endowment support for preservationist work in Kentucky, the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and for theater work by veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — a clear overture to Republicans to remember that endowment grants do not only go to liberal elites.","At an impromptu meeting at the arts endowment Wednesday, the chairwoman, Jane Chu, broke the news to the staff and said they would conduct business as usual as the budget-writing process unfolds in Congress, according to three federal officials with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversation. Ms. Chu said she called the meeting because she did not want the staff to learn about the proposals from media reports.","Staff members reacted in a professional manner, with a mixture of sadness and some surprise but no visible anger, one of the officials said. Talking points were given to the staff to handle phone calls from endowment grant recipients concerned about their money and the fate of the agencies.","In recent weeks, officials at both endowments were hopeful that President Trump would not propose draconian cuts, let alone elimination. One of the Trump administration’s liaisons to the arts endowment, Mary Anne Carter, had told officials that she was an advocate for the arts and that she wouldn’t have accepted the position if the endowment was going to be eliminated, according to an endowment official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations with Ms. Carter. (She declined to comment on Wednesday.)","Arts groups have already begun a furious lobbying campaign to press Republicans in Congress to save the endowments. The House will draft a budget in the coming months, and arts groups have already been focusing its lobbying efforts there. The Association of Art Museum Directors issued one of the first statements denouncing the president’s plan and urging Congress to save the endowments.","“I’m sort of dumbstruck,” said Brian Ferriso, the association’s president. “I’m hopeful that Congress will take the time to say, ‘Hey, wait a second. We need these cultural elements to our society.’”","Alexandra Nicholis Coon, the executive director of the Massillon Museum in Ohio, said her staff was relying on money from the humanities endowment for a project to record stories, scan letters, and photograph the uniforms of American soldiers who died in World War I. She criticized Mr. Trump’s opposition to the endowments as “shortsighted.”","“It’s disheartening to know that our president and the administration values community memory and the preservation of the American story so little,” said Ms. Coon, whose museum is in Stark County, where Mr. Trump trounced Hillary Clinton in the November election.","While some Republicans have voiced support for the endowments, the arts endowment in particular has been a target of conservatives for decades.","After political battles over the endowments in the late 1980s and 1990s, both agencies created programs and provided grants to more artists and scholars in politically conservative parts of the country, like a rural arts initiative that benefited states like Alabama and North Dakota. Yet endowment money still flowed strongly to liberal-leaning states and cities: New York City arts groups are the largest recipient of federal arts grants.","Some advocates for the arts endowment, which doles out far less money as a percentage than many other governments around the world, have said that its importance is less about the money and more about the message that it sends about the importance of culture in the United States.","PEN America, an advocacy group made up of literary figures, has been circulating a petition in an effort to save the endowments that has already amassed 200,000 signatures, including prominent names such as Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood.","Or, as Teresa Eyring of the Theatre Communications Group put it, the time has come for “action mode.”","“This is the beginning of a long road,” said Ms. Eyring, executive director of the group, which represents more than 500 nonprofit theaters around the country. “Now advocates and people in the arts community will communicate with their legislators and really try to make clear the value of this relatively modest but very important investment in our country through the arts.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: The Arts and Humanities; Call for Elimination Sets Off a Struggle.

Sonia Legg reports\nVideo provided by Reuters\nNewslook","The data on 50 million Facebook users a researcher reportedly sold to voter intelligence firm Cambridge Analytica was obtained legitimately. Here's how to make sure apps aren't getting more data than you want.(Photo: Loic Venance, AFP/Getty Images)","Facebook allows apps to access much of users' profile information but has tightened up some controls. For instance, it prevents apps from seeing the personal data of people in your friends' list, the giant loophole the British researcher legitimately used to access data that the researcher allegedly then, against Facebook's rules, sold to Cambridge Analytica — a misuse the social network knew about three years ago.","Things after that depend on what the app or site asked and what you allowed. An app can ask for access to anything in your profile — and can declare some of that information “required” — and you have to decide if you trust it with that data and if you trust the developer to delete your information should you later remove the app.","Apps used to be a big deal on Facebook, leading to the huge popularity of Farmville and Words with Friends, meaning that even if you haven't downloaded a Facebook app, you may already have given an app developer leeway to access your details.","Once you add an app to your Facebook profile or use your Facebook account to log into another site, it’s easy to forget the exposure you incurred and with whom you did business. Both things — the “what” of an app or site’s access to your data and the “who” of that outside company — matter.","You can check both in a desktop browser or Facebook’s mobile apps.","In a browser, click or tap the downward-facing triangle at the top right, then select “Settings” then “Apps.”","In Android, tap the three-line button at the top right, select “Account settings,” then “Apps.”","In iOS, that button is at bottom right, after which you tap “Settings,” “Account Settings” then “Apps.”","In either mobile app, tap a “Logged in with Facebook” banner.","You’ll now see a list of apps and sites, grouped by who on Facebook can see you use them — everyone, friends only, a custom setting or only you.","At a minimum, they all get what any stranger logged into Facebook would: “your name, profile picture, cover photo, gender, networks, username, and user ID.”","Things after that depend on what the app or site asked and what you allowed.","For example, in my account it showed that the Amex Offers app had access to my friends list, Likes and current city. I turned off friends-list and Likes sharing but let the city setting stand: American Express already knows where I live. The reading app Flipboard, however, only had access to my public profile.","To evict an app, click or tap the “X” next to its name. If you don’t recognize it, bring up its details and then click or tap “App Privacy Policy.”","Login with Facebook?","When you add an app or use Facebook to sign up at a different site, you should see a Facebook dialog explaining your data exposure, some of which you can decline.","For instance, using Facebook to log into the Guardian— the British newspaper that, with The New York Times, first reported the extent of the Cambridge Analytica data heist — yields a notice that the Guardian will see your public profile and email address.","That Facebook dialog lets you hide your email, although the Guardian’s own site will then ask you to provide it anyway.","(USA TODAY also lets readers sign up via Facebook, subject to sharing public profiles; in addition, this site employs Facebook’s comments system.)","What happened before the election?","This entire system assumes that an app developer will tell the truth, which did not happen in the Cambridge Analytica case.","As Facebook explained in a Friday night post announcing that British company’s suspension, the “thisisyourdigitallife” app created by University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan purported to be an academic research exercise.","But Kogan then gave Cambridge the data coughed up by some 270,000 people in 2013 — including details about their Facebook friends, an option that Facebook ended in 2014 and which allowed that app’s reach to hit that 50 million figure.","After this clear violation of Facebook’s rules — “Don't sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our services” — Cambridge used that information to construct a ad-targeting operation used by President Trump’s 2016 campaign, according to The New York Times report.","Cambridge Analytica has said it fully complied with Facebook's terms of service, while the Trump campaign denied using voter data from Cambridge Analytica. Kogan hasn't responded to USA TODAY requests for comment.","Facebook’s post added that it now reviews apps seeking “detailed user information.” In a statement forwarded by Facebook's corporate communications, vice president for global operations Justin Osofsky said, “We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”","Facebook did not, however, say if it had individually notified users of Kogan’s app about this treachery. The company does not have a policy requiring any such notification of what it does not consider a data breach. After all, you allowed the app in the first place.","In this case, the social network is leaving you on your own.","Rob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.

On Sunday morning, Trump accused special counsel Robert Mueller of hiring \"hardened Democrats\" to probe alleged ties between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Mueller is a Republican who has held appointments under Democratic and GOP presidents.","The president also dismissed the idea of former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired on Friday just two days before his retirement, having incriminating documents on him. Shortly after his firing, several media reports suggested McCabe kept a file of notes on his discussions with Trump, similar to documents former FBI Director James Comey is said to have taken.","Late Sunday, White House lawyer Ty Cobb once again said the president was not considering or discussing firing special counsel Robert Mueller.

But it stored records of whom some people texted, and when, as well as which phone numbers they called, when, and for how long.","It looks as if the party at fault here isn't Facebook directly but instead the Android operating system. Ars Technica points out that older versions of Android allowed apps to gain access to call and message logs when users actually just gave permission to read contacts.","It seems Facebook thought its users had given permission to share call and text logs with it.

It is — but the issues aren't new. Instead, they're problems the company put off dealing with.","Facebook knew that Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed its data in 2015, when a Guardian journalist revealed that the research firm had harvested data on millions of Facebook users. Facebook had already changed its app settings to stop people from handing over their friends' data, but it didn't bar Cambridge Analytica and continued to allow the company to operate on its platform.","And the new Android issue was due to a version of the Android operating system that allowed Facebook to gain message and call logs from 2015 to 2017.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Campaigns now have needle-in-the-haystack capabilities, provided by commercial marketing and media companies, to find and motivate an individual voter. The Trump team, for example, was able to identify someone from rural America who felt “disenfranchised,” had not voted in recent elections (and didn’t show up in polls as a likely voter), and then use a data-and-digital-concocted brew to trigger emotions and behavior.","Behind the digital curtain that informs and entertains is a commercial surveillance system whose function until recently has been primarily to sell us junk food, credit cards and retail products.","Advances in the best way to use all the information routinely captured and analyzed about us, and which has been greatly expanded by our use of mobile phones and apps, have helped companies to create highly detailed personal dossiers that merge our online and offline information, make predictions about how we — or others like us — will respond, and then orchestrate desired behaviors. Google boasts to its advertisers, for example, that it can help them connect with us in a “micromoment” — just at the point when we may make some decision. Facebook, for its part, assures marketers they can use its system to influence the decisions of “real people.”","Take A Look: No Escaping Dragnet Nation","There is little standing in the way of a Trump, Clinton or any other political effort from easily acquiring access to the huge reams of personal information now available through commercial data companies, sold by publishers and online enterprises and used to target us when we log on to social media such as Facebook. The digital marketing and data industry has largely been immune from any regulation under the Obama administration, either on consumer data collection practices or business operations. The US is still one of the only advanced-economy countries without comprehensive privacy legislation, and what little we have is already under threat. For the vast majority of Americans, there is practically no legal way to turn off or stem the flow of their information. The government’s “hands-off” approach to how Facebook, Google and the rest of the digital marketing industry operate has helped unleash powerful and unaccountable forces that helped elect our next president.","SCL’s operations illustrate how data analysis is being used today, from trying to win “hearts and minds” in Afghanistan to selling us Big Macs or a President Donald Trump. According to the company, they “combine commercial and public big-data sets with large-scale quantitative research to predict everything from whether people are likely to vote through to what products and services they are most likely to buy.” Its work with political campaigns takes advantage of the “predictive power of data” and uses “physio-lingual analysis tools to uncover subconscious … reasoning.”","The Trump campaign also used digital targeting to conduct “major voter suppression operations,” according to a report in Bloomberg, focusing on African-Americans, young women and white liberals.","Such capabilities benefited Trump, who only won because, as Cambridge Analytica itself wrote, “The president-elect flipped Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by margins of less than 2 percent. If Hillary Clinton had taken those last three states, she would have won the election. Trump won those three states by a combined margin of approximately 107,000 votes.” The company also explained:","The 2016 presidential election showed that the use of data to identify, persuade and turn out voters has become increasingly sophisticated. Cambridge Analytica’s data science, digital marketing and research teams informed key decisions on campaign travel, communications and resource allocation…. Every week Cambridge Analytica collected responses from 1,500 to 2,000 people in each battleground state. It used this research and data to model scores for all voters across key states: which candidate they preferred, which were “persuadable,” the issues they cared about and how likely they were to actually vote on Election Day. Every voter in each battleground state was also segmented by ethnicity, religion and the issues that concerned them most….","When, in the final weeks of the race, the firm’s data scientists recalculated voter turnout and recalibrated their models to show how Donald Trump could win, the GOP candidate revisited states like Michigan and Wisconsin…. Online ads placed by the firm were viewed a staggering 1.5 billion times by millions of Americans ….","If Hillary Clinton’s campaign was the Titanic, then Donald Trump’s campaign was a speedboat: nimble, flexible and able to adapt fast.”","The Trump campaign also used digital targeting to conduct “major voter suppression operations,” according to a report in Bloomberg, focusing on African-Americans, young women and white liberals — with tools including an onslaught of what are called “dark posts” on Facebook. These targeted messages included “a South Park-style animation of Hilary Clinton delivering her infamous 1996 ‘super predator’ remarks.” Marketers use dark posts to deliver targeted content to only on the Facebook newsfeeds of individuals, not on the ones operated by the companies that generate them. Giles-Parscale, another online marketing firm working for Trump, was part of “Project Alamo,” a digital data initiative spearheaded by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. “Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing,” said Brad Parscale, who is now assembling a nonprofit advocacy group designed to press Trump’s agenda from outside the White House. How Trump, Kushner and their operatives use the considerable data assets controlled by the White House (which was expanded under Obama) and work with their new outside digital operation should raise concerns, at the very least, from civil libertarians and others.","Google and Facebook likely will continue to be friendly ports of call for Trump and the GOP. They provide a host of services to both major political parties’ campaigns and have benefited from the Big Money pouring into them to target voters online. To help campaigns “understand the influence of digital media and online video in the 2016 elections,” Google hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz, along with Julie Hootkin from the Global Strategy Group, to offer insights as “guest editors” on the company’s principal website set up for advertisers. Google also promoted ways political advertisers could take advantage of YouTube, its search engine and all its other tools for marketers. It offered this advice: “Voter decisions used to be made in living rooms, in front of televisions. Today, they’re increasingly made in micromoments, on mobile devices.” The GOP was reported to have awarded Google a major share of its “largest digital ad deal ever,” earmarking $150 million to buy online video ads, according to Ad Age last May.","Facebook also offers targeting opportunities for political campaigns, which are encouraged to buy ads and other products to appeal to its more than 162 million US users, enabling campaigns to target by age, gender, congressional district and interests. Campaigns can also supply their own data to Facebook, which will help them target individuals. Facebook has promoted as an advertising “success” story its fundraising targeting for the conservative group Judicial Watch, which included a mobile ad (pictured right) prominently featuring a headshot of Hillary Clinton alongside the headline, “Hillary’s Email Scandal Exposed.” The case study explains, “Advanced matching for Custom Audiences is a targeting tool that allows advertisers to upload multiple data points at once to create an audience on Facebook. Data points include general information like first and last name, ZIP code, state, country, age and gender, and also email, phone number, mobile advertiser ID and Facebook app user ID.”","So many companies now specialize in or supply data to political campaigns, as well as offer ways to influence voters more precisely. There are even data made available to Republican campaigns by Democratic-oriented companies. For example, data analytics specialist L2, which has been helping Donald Trump since early 2015, offers a predictive modeling product that scores voters on “likelihood of support” on dozens of issues, including their views of Black Lives Matter, church attendance, fracking, gun laws, gay marriage, the Mexican border wall, transgender bathrooms and many more. HaystaqDNA, a political data firm started by operatives of President Obama’s previous campaigns, sold some of its own data to L2 (and which were used, according to a former Trump data official, to “pinpoint a specific type of would-be supporter.”)","While political campaigns will argue the First Amendment gives them the right to buy such data, we shouldn’t allow retailers, data brokers, online marketers and publishers to gather and use our personal information in the first place. Of course, Trump and the GOP-dominated Congress are not likely to pass any new privacy laws or impose regulations on how commercial data can be gathered and analyzed. Already, the GOP is said to be ready to reverse the Federal Communication Commission’s privacy rules that were adopted last October. The Federal Trade Commission is likely to become even weaker on data issues and governing consumer data marketing practices.","Jeff Chester is executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington, DC, nonprofit group that helps hold accountable the digital media industry.

He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.\"","The spokeswoman didn't directly address whether Stamos was planning to leave the company.","The news comes as Facebook deals with a controversy over Cambridge Analytica and its reported misuse of data from 50 million Facebook accounts.","Stamos made waves on Twitter this weekend when he criticized The New York Times and the Guardian for their portrayals of the way data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica used Facebook user data. The tweets said the situation, in which the firm accessed information from millions of Facebook accounts, wasn't a data breach or a leak. Then, he deleted those tweets.","Known for bursts of candidness on Twitter, Stamos has tweeted out his thoughts on a range of issues during his tenure at Facebook. In October, he let fly a string of tweets about the news media's coverage of artificial intelligence technology, which he said painted Silicon Valley unfairly as clueless.","\"Nobody of substance at the big companies thinks of algorithms as neutral,\" he wrote. \"Nobody is not aware of the risks.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Many Facebook users have been surprised to discover that the Facebook app had been rummaging through their phone contacts, obtaining numbers and names as well as call logs (you can stop the apps from doing that by following our instructions here) and others were surprised to see that Facebook knew the adverts they had clicked on, topics they have liked and old events they had frequented.","Continued below...","SPONSORED AD","If you want to learn what information Facebook has on you, you can download your entire Facebook data archive by heading to your main settings (for desktop users, that means clicking the down arrow at the top right of the page) and selecting Settings, and that takes you to your General settings page by default, which includes a link at the bottom stating Download a copy of your Facebook data. Just click that and confirm, and you will get an email telling you when the data is ready to download (you’ll need to re-enter your password for security reasons.)","This is usually a large file, since it includes photos, videos that you’ve shared on Facebook (or across Messenger) as well as photos, files and videos shared with you by others.

Best, Director of the SEC’s Atlanta Regional Office, said in a statement.","Equifax disclosed last year that hackers had obtained sensitive information, including Social Security numbers and dates of birth, for more than 143 million people. The breach began in May and was discovered by the company July 29.","According to the complaint, Equifax began assembling teams, “Project Sierra” and “Project Sparta” to respond to the breach. At the time, Ying, 42, had worked at Equifax since 2013 and was a leading candidate to become its global chief information officer. But he was not initially part of either team responding to the breach.","Then in late August, according to the complaint, Ying began to realize the company had been victim of a major theft. After a call with a high-ranking executive, Ying texted to a colleague: “Sounds bad. We may be the one breached. … Starting to put 2 and 2 together.”","A few days later, Ying searched online to determine how a major cyberbreach had affected the stock price of one of Equifax’s competitors, Experian. Within an hour of discovering how Experian’s stock price had suffered after a much smaller hack, Ying exercised all of his vested Equifax stock options, according to the complaints. He then sold those shares for nearly $1 million.","The next day, according to the indictment, Ying texted a friend: “I think some big media announcement is coming about us. … I think it might be bad.” Nine days later Equifax publicly announced that it had been breached, sending its stock price plummeting. If Ying had waited until news of the breach was made public, he would have suffered losses of $117,000, according to the SEC complaint.","The company dismissed Ying after learning about the trades and is cooperating with federal authorities, Equifax said in a statement. “We take corporate governance and compliance very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of our policies,” said Equifax’s interim Chief Executive Officer, Paulino do Rego Barros Jr.","Trading by other Equifax executives had also come under scrutiny. Chief Financial Officer John W. Gamble; Joseph M. Loughran III, president of U.S. information solutions; and Rodolfo O. Ploder, president of workforce solutions, sold large amounts of their shares of Equifax stock before news of the breach became public, and they made $2 million in profits. A special committee formed by Equifax’s board of directors investigated the matter and cleared those executives of wrongdoing last year. Also, none was mentioned in the complaints filed Wednesday against Ying.","The news is likely to renew complaints that Equifax hasn’t paid a high enough price for the breach. The company bungled its initial response, including a post on its Twitter page that mistakenly directed consumers in search of help to a fake site pretending to be Equifax. Its former chief executive Richard Smith was repeatedly hauled before Congress for lengthy hearings. Earlier this month, Equifax said that 2.4 million more consumers than previously reported were affected by the massive data breach, bringing the total of those affected to as many as 147.9 million consumers or about half the country.","But the government response has been largely muted so far. Despite numerous investigations, the firm has not been fined or charged for its conduct related to the breach. “Years from now, there are going to be families who can’t get home loans, families who have terrible credit scores, and families who are stuck fighting fraudulent charges because of Equifax,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement. “Someone has to answer for this.”","Renae MerleRenae Merle covers white-collar crime and Wall Street for The Washington Post.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.","The use of that information underlies many modern industries, and reaches into the most central parts of people’s lives. The Cambridge Analytica controversy has arisen in large part because it was being used by the Brexit and Trump campaigns – but as well as politics, the collection and use of data stretches deep into the most personal parts of our lives, and even attempts to predict whether people might come to commit a crime.","“I think this scandal is the tip of the iceberg,” said Javier Ruiz Diaz, policy director at Open Rights Group. “It also shows that there is a continuum between what you would call normal marketing and this completely unethical manipulation.”","The difficulty of picking between legitimate uses of data and unethical ones – as well as the broad use of such firms – makes legislating against it very difficult.","Downing Street released a statement calling the breach “very concerning” on Monday, but further disclosures in a Channel 4 News investigation have shown that the company discussed propaganda, disinformation and extortion tactics with prospective clients.","Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow minister for digital, called the combination of big data companies and foreign powers an “unholy alliance” which demanded legislation to stop any “interfering in our democracy”.","The use of data underpins the very idea of free services, which are paid for by collecting data about their users and then allowing advertisers to target them. But that same advertising data is being used to change the results of elections and other political events – something that Facebook and other companies have highlighted when courting political parties.","“We have become accustomed to throwing away our data with scant regard to the insight companies have about our lives,” said Raj Samani, McAfee Fellow and Chief Scientist. “Often we hear and worry about cybercriminals stealing from our devices, but in the same vein we accept ‘free’ services and pay by giving away every insight into our lives and those of our families.”","Cambridge Analytica’s work was described by the company’s chief data officer, Alex Taylor, in a documentary.","“If you’re collecting data on people and you’re profiling them, that gives you more insight that you can use to know how to segment the population, to give them messaging about issues that they care about, and language and imagery that they’re likely to engage with,” said Mr Taylor, in a secretly filmed meeting with Channel 4 News, broadcast on Monday.","“We used that in America and we used that in Africa. That’s what we do as a company.”","But that same description could apply to Facebook itself, as well as a whole host of other data broker companies that do similar work to Cambridge Analytica.","“So if you’re worried about this harvesting of Facebook data, you should also be worried about the ways in which third parties are tracking and profiling you. These companies, that you aren’t even aware of, hold vast amounts of very personal, very intimate information about you.”","It is almost impossible to know how effective the work of Cambridge Analytica was in the Brexit, Trump or other campaigns it has been attached to, since it cannot be measured. But other similar companies point to spectacular successes – many of them reaching to the most high-profile crimes and high-risk situations.","Palantir, for instance, describes itself as a firm that makes products that “transform the way organisations use their data”. But the company, backed by Trump ally Peter Thiel, is reported to have clients including many of the most secretive and powerful parts of the US government: a document leaked in 2015 said it was being used by the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, the Marine Corps and the Air Force.","Though the company says very little about what it does, it is thought to be something like the crime prediction powers fictionalised in Minority Report. Its software can run through vast amounts of data and try to pick out the people who might be involved in crime – it is said to have helped identify the scams run by Bernie Madoff, and has been deployed in Iraq to predict where roadside bombs might be detonated.","Other companies are involved in the collection and sale of more personal, less specific data. The firm Equifax, for instance, came to the fore when it was revealed last year that it had been hacked; many of the people involved were told that some of their most private information might have been disclosed, despite not even knowing that they had been part of the company’s database.","There have been substantial concerns about the lack of transparency around data brokers since at least 1970, when the US passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act. But that law only covers companies that buy and sell data for credit, employment and other similar purposes, and left exempt companies that use that data for marketing or political campaigns.","Since then, there have been relatively few regulations on both data brokers and the social networks who are customers of each other. Much of the data collected by US authorities – such as crime and even some health records – are readily available to data providers.","The EU and the UK, for instance, are both working on new data protection law this year. But such regulations require input from the US, and campaigners said that little is likely to be done without global pressure."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

In addition to saving data on where and when you log in, who your friends are, which friends you’ve removed, every message you’ve ever sent, and the like, a New Zealander named Dylan McKay discovered something else: a history of phone calls and text messages that he did not place through Facebook’s services.","Hmm! Weird! Why does Facebook have this? For some of the data, the answer is pretty simple. In order to connect you with users you already know, Facebook will cross-reference contact information you have with its own database. When the app requests access to your contacts, it uploads them to its own server, checks if the phone numbers and email addresses are already registered to certain users, and then reports back to you. Whether or not you think this is creepy, this is standard social-media practice. Should the contact info be purged after the cross-reference happens? Probably. Will that happen? No.","As for the call and message metadata-logging, that’s a different story. Before we go any further, I will point out that Facebook appears to have the communication metadata, not the actual contents of calls (it’s also the same type of metadata the NSA reportedly collects). In a “fact-check” blog post on Sunday, Facebook explained that it got that data from Android users who installed Messenger or Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of Facebook for users with slower data connections.","When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history. For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or ‘skip’. If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information, which can be downloaded at any time using the Download Your Information tool.","Facebook also says that you can delete the information from your profile entirely if you’d like. Okay.","What’s important to understand is this: For the (stated) purpose of a more satisfactory user experience, Facebook felt comfortable taking data from your phone, and storing it on its servers. You might not have understood exactly what access you were granting, and Facebook decided to use that to its advantage. It’s not Facebook’s problem that you gave it permission.","Now, compare this situation with the Cambridge Analytica one. Central to the matter was that Cambridge Analytica had kept Facebook user data outside of Facebook’s system, rather than reading it live. Think of it this way: You could check Monday’s weather on Friday, and work off of that, or you could check Monday’s weather on Monday. The latter is more up-to-date and reliable, and Facebook’s platform requires developers to pull data in a similar way, rather than retaining the data independently.","A developer built an app to collect user data, obtained permission through the platform’s official channels, and then saved a copy for their own use outside of Facebook. The last part of that was a regulatory violation, not a technological one. Facebook has no clear way of knowing how many apps siphoned data from the platform and were used to build independent databases.","What both of these instances show is that developers, regardless of who they are, will always opt for the most permissive definition of “access.” Facebook felt completely comfortable pulling as much of its users’ metadata as possible, and transferring it to its own servers. But by Facebook’s own admission, Cambridge Analytica doing the same with Facebook user data was a severe violation.","In addition to illustrating Facebook’s data-protection hypocrisy, it also points to a crisis in consumer technology. Does being able to access data also mean that developers are automatically allowed to copy and retain data? And what, if anything, can be done to stop the practice? Not even Facebook has a clear answer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.bikebiz.com/news/beaconisation","title":"Beaconising the world could kill off cycling, warns academic - BikeBiz","text":["Historian Peter Norton believes the bike industry should have a \"watching brief\" on \"connected car\" technologies but shouldn't jump into bed with automotive interests","An American academic has suggested that bike companies and organisations should not discuss “beaconisation” of bikes and cyclists with the “connected car” industry until the ramifications of such technology on mobility are better understood. Peter Norton said a “Darwinian struggle between differing street users” means cyclists and pedestrians will likely be the losers in any rights-grab over who and what should be electronically tagged \"for their own safety.”","Norton was responding to the news that an executive representing European and global bicycle industry organisations has been meeting with automative and telecommunication bodies to discuss technological standards for beacons, sensors, smartphone apps and other technologies that could keep cyclists safe by making them digitally trackable to the connected cars of today and the autonomous cars of the future.","“Technology is supposed to give us new choices, but instead it’s accelerating us along the same path as automobile domination,” said Norton, who is the author of the 2008 book Fighting Traffic which documented how “motordom” invented the term jaywalking in the early 20th Century in order to redefine what streets were for.","And they rapidly became for motor cars only, with pedestrians and cyclists marginalised, summarised Norton, who is the associate professor of history at the University of Virginia's Center for Transportation Studies.","Today's connectivity technology being mooted by car, telecoms and bike industry representatives is ostensibly for safety, but it’s also a re-run of “who gets priority on the streets,” Norton told me in an hour-long podcast interview.","The podcast was in response to this earlier BikeBiz article which documented a speech given by Manuel Marsilio at a connected car symposium on the first day of the Geneva Motor Show earlier this month. Marsilio is the general manager of Brussels-based CONEBI, the European trade organisation for the bike industry and he also represents the World Bicycle Industry Association.","“Bicycles will definitely have to communicate with the other vehicles as well as with infrastructure,” Marsilio told the audience.","He added:","“The bicycle industry deems that the proper deployment of harmonized connected services is key to this objective and agrees that interoperability is a must – it is unacceptable that road users nowadays could die on roads because vehicles cannot communicate with each other due to non interoperable communication technologies.”","He also said that: “Boosting user uptake requires an appropriate regulatory environment.”","This may seem like Marsilio is calling for mandatory use of such equipment – and the technology would only truly work if every cyclist, every pedestrian and every lamp-post had an electronic signature – but he has denied this.","“The Bicycle Association, as a CONEBI member, fully supports CONEBI and its very effective general manager Manuel Marsilio, in its work to engage with new technologies and to take the cycle industry voice to the international bodies which are developing standards and regulations in these areas.”","Garidis stressed: \"To be clear, neither Manuel, CONEBI nor the Bicycle Association have ever suggested, much less called for, mandatory beacons to be carried by cyclists. However, if there are safety or other benefits to be obtained from these emerging connectivity technologies which do not shift the burden of responsibility onto more vulnerable road users, it is important that the cycle industry engages at an early stage.”","Norton doesn’t believe any good will come out of such talks with dominant players. He said that Marsilio's statements so far had been “jaw-dropping,” especially in the light of the privacy concerns raised by the current Facebook debacle.","“To the tech industry the people moving around are an opportunity to collect rich data,” said Norton, and he believes “chipping” cyclists and pedestrians won’t ever be as lucrative as keeping people in autonomous cars, where their data can be harvested more easily and lucratively.","Calling Mansilio’s view of the future “disturbing” Norton agreed that “the status quo is also disturbing” but he advised that the negative feedback Mansilio has been getting on social media due to this story could have been prevented.","“Manuel could have offered a vision that rules out the grimmer possibilities,” Norton said on the podcast. “[He appeared not to have any] sense of caution. Everything was full speed ahead, network everybody. To me that was calculated to induce the anger that has shown up on social media.”","Instead, Mansilio should have realised that his talk to an automotive audience might be picked up by a cycling one, with the latter often having a number of different worldviews to the former.","“If Manual had said ‘we have to consider networked bikes and I recognize there are serious implications here’ then a lot of that social-media hate could have been avoided,” said Norton.","“He should stage a conference and invite philosophers, high-end cyclists, everyday cyclists, academics, some policy people, and sit down and talk about what the networked future should be, so that the benefits can be realised and that what we fear can be avoided.”","Manuel Marsilio","CONEBI/YouTube","Mansilio has been talking with the automotive sector since at least 2016. In that year he was invited to a high-level meeting organised by the transport committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECA). This body created a working group focusing on the prevention of road accidents in 1950 and, in 1988, established what is now the Global Forum for Road Traffic Safety. This forum oversees the United Nations’ legal instruments aimed at harmonising international traffic rules. These legal instruments, such as the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic, the 1968 Convention on Road Signs and Signals, and the 1958 and 1998 agreements on technical vehicle regulations, help create a legal framework that addresses the main causes of crashes such as driver behaviour, road infrastructure and vehicle safety.","Garidis flagged the fact that Marsilio has been responsible for cycling’s inclusion in this influential rule-making body.","“It is largely through Manuel's persistent and long term work that cycling now has a seat at the table,” said Garidis.","Marsilio is a staunch champion of cycling and protected cycleways. He told a UNECE meeting in 2016 that “policies like congestion pricing and fuel taxes could help governments and local authorities to invest more in cycling infrastructure.”","In video greetings sent to the Inland Transport Committee of the UNECE in May last year Marsilio said:","“I welcome the extremely valuable work the [Inland Transport Committee] has been doing to improve vehicle safety and the safety of vulnerable road users like cyclists. A correct legal and policy architecture at international level has a fundamental impact on the daily life of people.\"","He added: \"I’m proud to say that the European bicycle industry … contributes to the decarbonisation of transportation while, thanks to a forward-looking approach, is becoming a major player in the frameworks of mobility and interconnectivity.","“Intelligent transport systems have the potential to revolutionise mobility and UNECE offers a unique platform for shaping those frameworks and ensuring the safe introduction of future technologies.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful U.S. watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident. The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap. As a result, the new probe carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant, which is facing similar investigations in Europe.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on two panels -- the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee – already have invited Zuckerberg to testify at two upcoming hearings. But lawmakers have not indicated if they would seek to subpoena the Facebook executive if he declined to attend or sought to send another company official in his place.","The Senate Judiciary Committee panel, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

Caspar said: “It is and will remain Facebook’s business model to collect data and make it accessible to people with the right profiles in exchange for money.” Caspar attended a high-level meeting between German Justice Minster Katarina Barley and senior Facebook representatives in Berlin on Monday. The data protection officer subsequently lamented that no convincing proposals had been made on behalf of Facebook to redress the situation. Barley has demanded a “comprehensive investigation” into whether German users were affected by the illegal use of information from millions of Facebook profiles during “electoral strategy” work by the company Cambridge Analytica for the U.S. Trump presidential campaign and the British Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum. The justice minister went as far as to describe the social network as a “threat to democracy and the rule of law”. She further emphasized that it was the responsibility and right of the European Union and its member state governments to determine the rules of the game by which tech companies must operate in the bloc. According to media reports, Cambridge Analytica used an application designed by the Russian academic Aleksandr Kogan to illegally access the data of around 50 million Facebook users. The information was used for targeted campaign advertisements, “micro-targeting” to sway voters in favor of casting their ballot for U.S. President Donald Trump or to vote Leave in the British referendum. In a recent appearance before the British parliament, ex-Cambridge programmer Christopher Wylie shocked delegates by stating that he had not doubt that his former employer had manipulated the Brexit referendum and broken the law."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

According to the Financial Times, reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly filmed a series of meetings, including one with the chief executive. The report is due to air this week.","Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be recalling Nix to give further testimony to explain why he had told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook.","“We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments,” he said.","Collins will also call on Zuckerberg to testify. He said the company appeared to have previously sent executives who were able to avoid difficult questions and who “claimed not to know the answers”.","The two men may also face a summons from US lawmakers. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia.","The Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian.","“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records. It denies using any Facebook data in the campaign.","Shortly before the story broke, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer that it was making “false and defamatory” allegations and reserved Facebook’s legal position. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach.","It also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan.","The public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate. He described it as a chilling attack on someone acting in the public interest.","“They acknowledged my offer but then turned around and shot the messenger. I’m trying to make amends for my mistakes and so should Facebook,” he told the Guardian. “Facebook has known about this for at least two years and did almost nothing to fix it. This is not new. And it’s only by coming forward that Facebook is now taking action. People need to know this kind of profiling is happening.”","Collins said his committee wanted more information from Facebook about the circumstances around the breach. “Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","Last month, both Facebook representatives and Nix told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from GSR.","Play Video","0:25","Cambridge Analytica chief denies working with Facebook data - video","But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ‘platform policies’ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” the statement said.","Collins attacked Facebook for appearing to have been “deliberately avoiding answering straight questions” in testimony to the committee.","“It is now clear that data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,” Collins said. “Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","Cambridge Analytica responded to the Observer story on Twitter before Collins had said Nix would be recalled. “We refute(s) these mischaracterizations and false allegations,” it said.","“Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data,” the company said. “When we learned GSR sold us Facebook data that it shouldn’t have done, we deleted it all – system wide audit to verify.”","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act,” a statement attributed to acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection Tom Pahl read. “Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements.”","The Post reported that the investigation is specifically into whether or not Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree that ended an FTC-led investigation into Facebook at the time. The decree stipulated that the company must ensure that it gives consumers “clear and prominent notice” and obtain “consumers’ express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.”","Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of scrutiny over the past 18 months, as reporters and politicians have sought to uncover the role it may have played in President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory, the 2016 Brexit referendum, and other political campaigns around the globe. The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in 2016 to work on its data operations.","After the FTC released its statement on Monday, Facebook released a statement, attributed to deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman, that read “we remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information.

The journalist posed as a fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get candidates elected in Sri Lanka.","In one exchange filmed in January, Nix said Cambridge Analytica could send \"somebody posing as a wealthy developer\" to Sri Lanka to offer incumbent politicians a \"large amount of money\" in a \"deal that's too good to be true,\" such as for land.","\"We'll have the whole thing recorded on cameras, we'll blank out the face of our guy, and then post it on the internet,\" Nix said on camera.","\"These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption,\" he added.","Offering bribes to public officials is an offense under both the UK's Bribery Act and the US's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Cambridge Analytica operates in the UK and is registered in the US.","At the same meeting at London's five-star Berkeley Hotel, Nix said Cambridge Analytica could \"send some girls around to the candidate's house — we have lots of history of things.\"","He added: \"That was just an idea. I'm just saying we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know. You know what I'm saying.\"","In the footage, Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, also described the company's process of discreetly seeding compromising videos on the internet and helping them go viral.","Turnbull. Channel 4 News","At a meeting in December, Turnbull told Channel 4's reporter: \"We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then — and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again … like a remote control.\"","He also said: \"It has to happen without anyone thinking 'that's propaganda,' because the moment you think 'that's propaganda,' the next question is 'who's put that out?'\"","Channel 4 News' investigation also accuses Cambridge Analytica of using \"shadowy front companies\" or subcontractors to achieve its aims.","You can watch excerpts from the secret filming below.","According to Channel 4 News, the executives also boasted that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communications Laboratories Group, had worked in more than 200 elections across the world, including in Nigeria, Kenya, the Czech Republic, India, and Argentina. Cambridge Analytica also worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.","Business Insider contacted Cambridge Analytica more than two hours before the Channel 4 investigation was broadcast, and a spokesman said it was \"hard to reply to something we haven't seen.\" But Business Insider understands that Channel 4 News sent the data firm a 20-page document a week ago detailing the allegations and the contents of the undercover filming.","The data firm told Channel 4 News, \"We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever,\" adding that \"Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.\"","Channel 4 News says it will broadcast further allegations later this week about Cambridge Analytica's work for the Trump campaign.","Update: A Cambridge Analytica representative emailed Business Insider with the company's full statement soon after Channel 4 News' investigation aired on British television.","It included a direct quote from Nix, saying he played along with the undercover reporter, who he thought was a client, to spare them from embarrassment.","Read the statement in full:","Cambridge Analytica held a series of meetings with the undercover reporter to discuss philanthropic, infrastructure, and political projects in Sri Lanka. While outlining the company's services as a data-driven communications and marketing agency, a senior Cambridge Analytica executive clearly set out the principles which govern its work and said the following to the undercover reporter:","\"We're not in the business of fake news, we're not in the business of lying, making stuff up, and we're not in the business of entrapment … There are companies that do this but to me that crosses a line.\"","Despite this clear statement, the undercover reporter later attempted to entrap Cambridge Analytica executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. After several meetings discussing ostensibly legitimate projects, the reporter unexpectedly and suddenly turned the conversation towards practices such as corruption and the entrapment of political figures.","Assessing the legality and reputational risks associated with new projects is critical for us, and we routinely undertake conversations with prospective clients to try to tease out any unethical or illegal intentions. The two Cambridge Analytica executives at the meeting humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions. They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again.","We use meetings like this to make an informed decision about those whom we should or shouldn't engage with, in line with the guidance laid out by Section 9 of the UK Bribery Act 2010. The company's practice is for staff to gently de-escalate the conversation before removing themselves from the situation. However, CEO Alexander Nix acknowledges that on this occasion he misjudged the situation:","\"In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case. I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps,' and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose.","\"I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.\"","Cambridge Analytica is a high-profile company. While we work for clients from all sides of the political mainstream across many countries, some do not want it known that they are using a professional political consultancy. We understand this and allow our clients to work with us discreetly. This is not unusual in the industry.","Like any marketing agency, Cambridge Analytica uses social media platforms for placing paid advertisements and organic content. Influencer marketing and building grassroots networks on social media are both common activities for a modern political campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

See, we’re still including the link to VICE‘s version.","Trump Knows You Better Than You Know YourselfPsychometrics and the (counter)revolution in marketing that is helping bring fascism to power around the world","AntiNote: The following is an unauthorized translation of a December 2016 article that caused quite a stir in the German-language press. Das Magazin(Zurich) occupies a respected position within the German-language cultural and literary media landscape, functionally similar to (though perhaps not quite as prominent as) The New Yorker, and this work by investigative reporters Hannes Grassegger and Mikael Krogerus got a lot of attention—and generated some controversy, for apparently having scooped the English-language media with sensational observations about 2016’s most sensational story, the campaign and electoral victory of a fascist dictator in the United States.","Perhaps for this reason, the article has not appeared in translation in (or even had its investigative threads taken up by) English-language media outlets, even after nearly two months. Antidote presents, therefore, our own preemptive translation to fill this gap.

We have also added a few further links to supporting documentation. The basic thrust and thesis of the article remain unaltered.]","“I just showed that the bomb was there.”By Hannes Grassegger and Mikael Krogerus for Das Magazin (Zurich)\n3 December 2016 (original post)","Psychologist Michal Kosinski developed a method of analyzing people’s behavior down to the minutest detail by looking at their Facebook activity—did a similar tool help propel Donald Trump to victory?","On November 9th, around 8:30 in the morning, Michal Kosinski awoke in his hotel room in Zurich. The 34-year-old had traveled here to give a presentation to the Risk Center at the ETH [Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule or Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich] at a conference on the dangers of Big Data and the so-called digital revolution. Kosinski gives such presentations all over the world. He is a leading expert on psychometrics, a data-driven offshoot of psychology. Turning on the television that morning in Zurich, he saw that the bomb had gone off: defying the predictions of nearly every leading statistician, Donald J. Trump had been elected president of the United States of America.","Kosinski watched Trump’s victory celebration and the remaining election returns for a long while. He suspected that his research could have had something to do with the result. Then he took a deep breath and turned off the television.","On the same day, a little-known British company headquartered in London issued a press release: “We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communications played such an integral part in president-elect Donald Trump’s extraordinary win,” Alexander James Ashburner Nix is quoted as saying. Nix is British, 41 years old, and CEO of Cambridge Analytica. He is always immaculately turned out in a tailored suit and designer eyeglasses, his slightly wavy blond hair combed back.","The meditative Kosinski, the well-groomed Nix, the widely grinning Trump—one made this digital upheaval possible, one carried it out, and one rode it to power.","How dangerous is Big Data?","Anyone who didn’t spend the last five years on the moon has heard the term Big Data. The emergence of Big Data has meant that everything we do, online or off-, leaves digital traces. Every purchase with a card, every Google search, every movement with a cellphone in your pocket, every “like” gets stored. Especially every “like.” For a while it wasn’t entirely clear what any of this data would be good for, other than showing us ads for blood pressure medication after we google “high blood pressure.” It also wasn’t entirely clear whether or in what ways Big Data would be a threat or a boon to humanity.","Since November 9th, 2016, we know the answer. Because one and the same company was behind both Trump’s online ad campaigns and mid-2016’s other shocker, the Brexit “Leave” campaign: Cambridge Analytica, with its CEO Alexander Nix. Anyone who wants to understand the outcome of the US elections—and what could be coming up in Europe in the near future—must begin with a remarkable incident at the University of Cambridge in 2014, at Kosinski’s Psychometrics Center.","Psychometrics, sometimes also known as psychography, is a scientific attempt to “measure” the personality of a person. The so-called Ocean Method has become the standard approach. Two teams of psychologists were able to demonstrate in the 1980s that the character profile of a person can be measured and expressed in five dimensions, the Big Five: Openness (how open are you to new experiences?), Conscientiousness (how much of a perfectionist are you?), Extroversion (how sociable are you?), Agreeableness (how considerate and cooperative are you?), and Neuroticism (how sensitive/vulnerable are you?). With these five dimensions (O.C.E.A.N.), you can determine fairly precisely what kind of person you are dealing with—their needs and fears as well as how they are likely to behave. For a long time, however, the problem was data collection, because to produce such a character profile meant asking subjects to fill out a complicated survey asking quite personal questions. Then came the internet. And Facebook. And Kosinski.","Michal Kosinski was a student in Warsaw when his life took a new direction in 2008: he was accepted to the prestigious University of Cambridge in England to do doctoral work at the Psychometrics Center, one of the oldest institutions of its kind worldwide. Kosinski joined fellow student David Stillwell (now a lecturer at Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge) about a year after Stillwell had launched a little Facebook application, in the days when the platform had not yet become the behemoth it is today. With MyPersonality, a user could fill out psychometric questionnaires, including a handful of questions from the Ocean survey (“I panic easily” – “I contradict others”), and receive a rating, or a “Personality Profile” consisting of individual Big Five values—and, when prompted, opt-in to share their Facebook profile data with the researchers. Instead of a couple dozen college friends participating, as Kosinski had expected, first hundreds, then thousands, then millions of people had bared their souls. Suddenly the two doctoral students had access to the then-largest psychological data set ever produced.","The process that Kosinski and his colleagues developed over the years that followed is actually quite simple. First surveys are distributed to test subjects—this is the online quiz. From the subjects’ responses, their personal Big Fivescores are calculated. Then Kosinski’s team would compare these results to all sorts of other online data about test subjects—what they’ve liked, shared, or posted on Facebook; gender, age, and location. Thus the researchers began to find correlations, and began to see that amazingly reliable deductions could be made about a person by observing their online behavior. For example, men who “liked” the cosmetics brand MAC were more likely to be gay. One of the best indicators of heterosexuality was liking Wu-Tang Clan. People who followed Lady Gaga, furthermore, tended to be extroverts. Someone who likes philosophy is more likely introverted. While each piece of such information is too weak to produce a reliable prediction, when tens, hundreds, or thousands of individual data points are combined, the resulting predictions become really accurate.","Kosinski and his team continued, tirelessly refining their models. In 2012, Kosinski demonstrated that from a mere 68 Facebook likes on average, a lot about a user could be reliably predicted: skin color (95% accuracy), sexual orientation (88% accuracy), Democrat or Republican (85%). But there’s more: level of intellect; religious affiliation; alcohol-, cigarette-, and drug abuse could all be calculated. Even whether or not your parents were divorced could be teased out of the data.","The strength of the model depended on how well it could predict a test subject’s answers. Kosinski kept working at it. Soon, with a mere ten “likes” as input his model could appraise a person’s character better than an average coworker. With seventy, it could “know” a subject better than a friend; with 150 likes, better than their parents. With 300 likes, Kosinski’s model could predict a subject’s answers better than their partner. With even more likes it could exceed what a person thinks they know about themselves.","The day he published these findings, Kosinski received two phonecalls. One was a threat to sue, the other a job offer. Both were from Facebook.","Only Visible to Friends","Just weeks later, Facebook likes became private by default (until then, the default setting had been that anyone on the internet could see your likes). This is still no obstacle for data-collectors: while Kosinski always requests the consent of the Facebook users he tests, many apps and online quizzes demand access to private information as a precondition to taking a personality test. (Anyone who is not overly concerned about their private information and wants to get assessed according to their Facebook likes can do so at Kosinski’s website, and then compare the results to those of a “classic” Ocean survey here.)","But it’s not just about likes. Kosinski and his team figured out how to ascribe Big Five values based only on how many profile pictures or how many social media contacts a person has (this is a good indicator of extroversion). And it’s not even just about Facebook. We also betray information about ourselves when we are offline. Motion sensors in a smartphone can show, for example, how fast we move it and how far we are traveling (correlates with emotional instability). A smartphone, Kosinski found, is in itself a powerful psychological survey that we, consciously or unconsciously, are constantly filling out.","Above all, though—and this is important to understand—it also works another way: using all this data, psychological profiles can not only be constructed, but they can also be sought and found. For example if you’re looking for worried fathers, or angry introverts, or undecided Democrats. What Kosinski had invented was essentially a search engine for people. He has been getting more and more acutely aware of both the potential and the danger his work presents.","The internet always seemed to him a gift from heaven. What he really wanted was to give something back, to share. Data can be copied, so why shouldn’t everyone benefit from it? It was the spirit of an entire generation, the beginning of a new era free of the limits of the physical world. But what could happen, Kosinski asked himself, if someone misused his search engine in order to manipulate people? He began to add warnings to most of his scientific work [e.g.]: these prediction techniques, he warned, could be used in ways that “pose a threat to an individual’s well-being, freedom, or even life.” But no one seemed to understand what he meant.","Around this time, in early 2014, a young assistant professor named Aleksandr Kogan approached Kosinski. He said he had received an inquiry from a company interested in Kosinski’s methods. They apparently wanted to access the MyPersonality database, Kosinski remembers. To what purpose, Kogan couldn’t say: there were strict secrecy stipulations. At first, Kosinski and his team considered the offer—it would have meant a lot of money for his institute. But he hesitated. Finally, Kosinski remembers, Kogan divulged the name of the company: SCL, Strategic Communications Laboratories. Kosinski googled them [so did Antidote. Here. —ed.]: “[We are] a global election management agency,” said the company website [really, the website has even creepier language on it than that. “Behavioral change communication”? Go look already. —ed.]. SCL offers marketing based on a “psychographic targeting” model. With an emphasis on “election management” and political campaigns? Disturbed, Kosinski clicked through the pages. What kind of company is this? And what do they have planned for the United States?","What Kosinski didn’t know at the time: SCL is the public front of a complex group of companies whose byzantine corporate structures make it unclear who owns it and its diverse branches—as can be seen in the UK Companies House, the Panama Papers, and the Delaware company registry. Some SCL offshoots have been involved in overthrowing governments in developing countries; others have done work developing methods for psychologically manipulating the population in Afghanistan for NATO. SCL is also the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, this ominous Big Data outfit that later managed online marketing for both Trump and the Brexit “Leave” campaign.","Kosinski didn’t know any of that, but he had a bad feeling: “The whole thing started to stink,” he recalls. Looking into it further, he discovered that Aleksandr Kogan had secretly registered a company doing business with SCL. Documents obtained by Das Magazin confirm that SCL learned about Kosinski’s methods through Kogan, as was also revealed by the Guardian in December 2015. It suddenly dawned on Kosinski that Kogan could have reconstructed (or copied?) his Facebook likes-based Big Five measurement tool in order to sell it to this election-manipulating company. He immediately broke off contact with him and informed the head of the institute. A complicated battle ensued within Cambridge University. The institute feared for its reputation. Aleksandr Kogan moved to Singapore, got married, and began calling himself Dr. Spectre. Michal Kosinski finished his doctorate, got a job offer from Stanford University, and moved to the United States.","For a year or so it was quiet. Then, in November 2015, the more radical of the two Brexit campaigns (leave.eu, supported by Nigel Farage) announced that they had contracted with a Big Data firm for online marketing support: Cambridge Analytica. The core expertise of this company: innovative political marketing, so-called microtargeting, by measuring people’s personality from their digital footprints based on the Ocean model.","Kosinski started getting emails asking if he had had anything to do with it—for many, his is the first name to spring to mind upon hearing the terms Cambridge, Ocean, and analytics in the same breath. This is when he heard of Cambridge Analytica for the first time. Appalled, he looked up their website. Were his methods being deployed, on a massive scale, for political purposes?","After the Brexit vote in July the email inquiries turned to insults and reproaches. Just look what you’ve done, friends and colleagues wrote. Kosinski had to explain over and over again that he had nothing to do with this company.","First Brexit, Then Trump","September 19th, 2016: the US presidential election is approaching. Guitar riffs fill the dark blue ballroom of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York: CCR’s “Bad Moon Rising.” The Concordia Summit is like the WEF in miniature. Decision makers from all over the world are invited; among the guests is Swiss president Johann Schneider-Ammann.","A gentle women’s voice comes over the PA: “Please welcome Alexander Nix, Chief Executive Officer of Cambridge Analytica.” A lean man in a dark suit strides towards the center of the stage. A attentive quiet descends. Many in the room already know: this is Trump’s new Digital Man. “Soon you’ll be calling me Mr. Brexit,” Trump had tweeted cryptically a few weeks before. Political observers had already been pointing out the substantial similarities between Trump’s agenda and that of the rightwing Brexit camp; only a few had noticed the connection to Trump’s recent hiring of a largely unknown marketing company: Cambridge Analytica.","Before then, Trump’s online campaign had consisted more or less of one person: Brad Parscale, a marketing operative and failed startup founder who had built Trump a rudimentary website for $1,500. The 70-year-old Trump is not what one would call an IT-whiz; his desk is unencumbered by a computer. Trump doesn’t do email, his personal assistant once let slip. It was she who persuaded him to get a smartphone—the one from which he has uninhibitedly tweeted ever since.","Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, was relying on the endowment of the first social media president, Barack Obama. She had the Democratic Party’s address lists, worked with cutting-edge Big Data analysts from BlueLabs, and received support from Google and Dreamworks. When it was announced in June 2016 that Trump had hired Cambridge Analytica, Washington collectively sneered. Foreign noodlenecks in tailored suits who don’t understand this country and its people? Seriously?","“Ladies and gentlemen, honorable colleagues, it is my privilege to speak to you today about the power of Big Data and psychographics in the electoral process.” The Cambridge Analytica logo appears behind Alexander Nix—a brain, comprised of a few network nodes and pathways, like a subway map. “It’s easy to forget that only eighteen months ago Senator Cruz was one of the less popular candidates seeking nomination, and certainly one of the more vilified,” begins the blond man with his British diction that produces the same mixture of awe and resentment in Americans that high German does the Swiss. “In addition, he had very low name recognition; only about forty percent of the electorate had heard of him.”","Everyone in the room was aware of the sudden rise, in May 2016, of the conservative senator. It was one of the strangest moments of the primary campaign. Cruz had become the last serious challenger to frontrunner Trump in the Republican field of presidential candidates, rising from 5 to 35 percent. “How did he do this?” continues Nix.","Cambridge Analytica had begun engaging with US elections towards the end of 2014, initially to advise Ted Cruz, funded by the secretive American tech billionaire Robert Mercer. Up to that point, according to Nix, election campaign strategy had been guided by demographic concepts. “But this is a really ridiculous idea, the idea that all women should receive the same message because of their gender; or all African-Americans because of their race.” The Hillary Clinton campaign team was still operating on precisely such amateurish assumptions—Nix need not even mention—which divide the electorate up into ostensibly homogeneous groups…exactly the same way as all the public opinion researchers who predicted a Clinton victory did.","Nix clicks to the next slide: five different faces, each representing a personality profile. It is the Ocean model. “At Cambridge, we’ve rolled out a long-form quantitative instrument to probe the underlying traits that inform personality. This is the cutting edge in experimental psychology.” It is now completely silent in the hall. “By having hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans undertake this survey, we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.” The success of Cambridge Analytica’s marketing arises from the combination of three elements: this psychological behavioral analysis of the Ocean model, Big Data evaluation, and ad targeting. Ad targeting is personalized advertisement tailored as precisely as possible to the character of a single consumer.","Nix explains forthrightly how his company does this (the presentation can be viewed on YouTube). From a range of different sources, Cambridge Analytical buys up personal data: “What car you drive, what products you purchase in shops, what magazines you read, what clubs you belong to.” Land registry and church membership. On the screen behind him are displayed the logos of global data brokers like Acxiom and Experian—in the United States nearly all personal consumer data is available for purchase. If you want to know, for example, where Jewish women live, you can simply buy this information. Including telephone numbers. Now Cambridge Analytica crosschecks these data sets with Republican Party voter rolls and online data such as Facebook likes, and constructs an Ocean personality profile. From a selection of digital signatures there suddenly emerge real individual people with fears, needs, and interests—and home addresses.","The methodology looks quite similar to the models that Michal Kosinski once developed. Cambridge Analytica also uses surveys on social media in order to gain access to the powerful predictive personal information wrapped up in the Facebook likes of users. And Cambridge Analytica is doing precisely what Kosinski had warned about. “We have profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America—220 million people,” Nix boasted in an interview with Das Magazin. And all the evidence suggests that they deployed this powerful data set politically.","Back in the ballroom of the Hyatt, Nix clicks to the next slide. “This is a data dashboard that we prepared for the Cruz campaign for the Iowa caucus. It looks intimidating, but it’s actually very simple.” On the left, graphs and diagrams; on the right, a map of Iowa, where Cruz had done surprisingly well in the caucuses. On this map, hundreds of thousands of tiny dots, red and blue. Nix begins to narrow down search criteria to a category of Republican caucus-goers he describes as a “persuasion” group, whose common Ocean personality profile and home locations are now visible, a smaller set of people to whom advertisement can be more effectively tailored. Ultimately the criteria can be narrowed to a single individual, along with his name, age, address, interests, and political leanings. How does Cambridge Analytica approach this person with political messaging?","Earlier in the presentation, using the example of the Second Amendment, Nix showed two variations on how certain psychographic profiles are spoken to differently. “For a highly Neurotic and Conscientious audience, you’re going to need a message that is both rational and fear-based: the threat of a burglary and the ‘insurance policy’ of a gun is very persuasive.” A picture on the left side of the screen shows a gloved hand breaking a window and reaching for the inside door handle. On the right side, there is a picture of a man and child silhouetted against a sunset in tall grass, both with rifles, obviously duck hunting: “for a Closed and Agreeable audience, people who care about traditions and habits and family and community, talking about these values is going to be much more effective in communicating your message.”","How to Keep Clinton Voters Away","Trump’s conspicuous contradictions and his oft-criticized habit of staking out multiple positions on a single issue result in a gigantic number of resulting messaging options that creates a huge advantage for a firm like Cambridge Analytica: for every voter, a different message. Mathematician Cathy O’Neil had already observed in August that “Trump is like a machine learning algorithm” that adjusts to public reactions. “Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,” Alexander Nix explained to Das Magazin. On the day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, Trump’s team blasted out 175,000 distinct test variations on his arguments, mostly via Facebook. The messages varied mostly in their microscopic details, in order to communicate optimally with their recipients: different titles, colors, subtitles, with different images or videos. The granularity of this message tailoring digs all the way down to tiny target groups, Nix told Das Magazin. “We can target specific towns or apartment buildings. Even individual people.”","In the Miami neighborhood of Little Haiti, Trump’s campaign regaled residents with messages about the failures of the Clinton Foundation after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, in order to dissuade them from turning out for Clinton. This was one of the goals: to get potential but wavering Clinton voters—skeptical leftists, African-Americans, young women—to stay home. To “suppress” their votes, as one Trump campaign staffer bluntly put it. In these so-called dark posts (paid Facebook ads which appear in the timelines only of users with a particular suitable personality profile), African-Americans, for example, were shown the nineties-era video of Hillary Clinton referring to black youth as “super predators.”","Nix begins to wrap up his presentation at the Concordia Summit: “Blanket advertising—the idea that a hundred million people will receive the same piece of direct mail, the same television advert, the same digital advert—is dead. My children will certainly never understand this concept of mass communication. Today, communication is becoming ever increasingly targeted.","“The Cruz campaign is over now, but what I can tell you is that of the two candidates left in this election, one of them is using these technologies. And it’s going to be very interesting to see how they impact the next seven weeks. Thank you.” With that, he exits the stage.","It is not knowable just to what extent the American population is being targeted by Trump’s digital troopers—because they seldom attack through the mainstream broadcast media, but rather mostly with highly personalized ads on social media or through digital cable. And while the Clinton team sat back in the confidence that it was safe with its demographic calculations, a new crew was moving into the Trump online campaign headquarters in San Antonio, Texas, as Bloomberg journalist Sasha Issenberg noted with surprise after a visit. The Cambridge Analytica team, apparently just a dozen people, had received around $100,000 from Trump in July; in August another $250,000; five million in September. Altogether, says Nix, they took in around fifteen million.","And the company took even more radical measures: starting in July 2016, a new app was prepared for Trump campaign canvassers with which they could find out the political orientation and personality profile of a particular house’s residents in advance. If the Trump people ring a doorbell, it’s only the doorbell of someone the app has identified as receptive to his messages, and the canvassers can base their line of attack on personality-specific conversation guides also provided by the app. Then they enter a subject’s reactions to certain messaging back into the app, from where this new data flows back to the dashboards of the Trump campaign.","This is nothing new. The Clinton campaign did similar things—but as far as we know they did not use psychometric profiling. Cambridge Analytica, however, divided the US population into 32 personality types, and concentrated on only seventeen states. And just as Kosinski had determined that men who like MAC cosmetics on Facebook are more likely to be gay, Cambridge Analytica found that a preference for American-produced cars is a great indicator of a possible Trump voter. Among other things, this kind of knowledge could inform Trump himself which messages to use, and where. The decision to focus candidate visits in Michigan and Wisconsin over the final weeks of the campaign was based on this manner of data analysis. The candidate himself became an implementation instrument of the model.","What is Cambridge Analytica Doing in Europe?","But to what extent did psychometric methods influence the outcome of the election? Cambridge Analytica, when asked, did not want to disclose any documentation assessing the effectiveness of their campaign. It is possible that the question of how important psychometric targeting was in the 2016 election cannot be answered at all. Still, some indicators should be considered: there is the fact that Ted Cruz, thanks to the help of Cambridge Analytica, rose out of obscurity to become Trump’s strongest competitor in the primaries; there is the increase in rural voter turnout; there is the reduction, compared to 2008 and 2012, in African-American voter participation. The fact that Trump spent so little money may also be explained by the effectiveness of personality-based advertising. As does the fact that he invested far more in digital than TV campaigning compared to Hillary Clinton. Facebook proved to be his ultimate weapon and his best election campaigner, as the tweeting of several Trump staffers describes it. In Germany, the rightwing upstart party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) may like the sound of this, as they have more Facebook friends than Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) combined.","It is therefore not at all the case, as is so often claimed, that statisticians lost this election because their polls were so faulty. The opposite is true: statisticians won this election. It was just certain statisticians, the ones using the new method. It is a cruel irony of history that Trump, who often grumbled about scientific research, used such a highly scientific approach in his campaign.","Another big winner in the election was Cambridge Analytica. Steve Bannon, a Cambridge Analytica board member and former executive chair of the ultra-rightwing online site Breitbart News, was named Trump’s chief strategist. Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, ambitious Front National activist and niece of the presidential candidate, has tweeted that she would accept his invitation to collaborate. In an internal company video, there is a recording of a discussion entitled “Italy.” While Cambridge Analytica is not willing to comment on alleged ongoing talks with UK prime minister Theresa May, Alexander Nix claims that he is in the process of client acquisition, worldwide, and that he has received inquiries out of Switzerland and Germany.","Kosinski has been observing all of this from his office at Stanford. After the election, the university has been in turmoil. Kosinski is responding to the developments with the most powerful weapon available to a researcher: scientific analysis. Along with his research colleague Sandra Matz, he conducted a series of tests that will soon be published. The initial results seen by Das Magazin are unsettling: The study shows the effectiveness of personality targeting by showing that marketers can attract up to 63% more clicks and up to 1400% more conversions in real-life advertising campaigns on Facebook when matching products and marketing messages to consumers’ personality characteristics. They further demonstrate the scalability of personality targeting by showing that the majority of Facebook Pages promoting products or brands are affected by personality and that large numbers of consumers can be accurately targeted based on a single Facebook Page.","The world has been turned upside down. The Brits are leaving the EU; Trump rules America. And in Stanford the Polish researcher Michal Kosinski, who indeed tried to warn of the danger of using psychological targeting in a political setting, is still getting accusatory emails. “No,” says Kosinski quietly, shaking his head, “this is not my fault. I did not build the bomb. I just showed that it was there.”","Translated by Antidote, with minor adjustments based on a Das Magazin internal draft [26 January 2017]","Featured image: cartoon by Christiane Pfohlmann; text is untranslatable wordplay in which Trump is saying “I can’t do anything about it” and “I have Nix to thank.” Source: toonpool.com","Paul-Olivier Dehaye contributed to the preparation of the original article, which also included a link to his website where you can request your data from Cambridge Analytica: PersonalData.IO","Share this:","Like this:","31 thoughts on “Trump Knows You Better Than You Know Yourself”","Reblogged this on Ali's Journal and commented:\nthis tells us that all our fears had come true even back in 2012 ! .. today they are collecting and using the activity of “every” person online doing anything and everything and using it to predict or mold or re-route and ultimate ‘control’ his life !","Reblogged this on marmalade season and commented:\nRevolting. Trump voters, you were duped. Consider this thought, contained within the article: “Trump’s conspicuous contradictions and his oft-criticized habit of staking out multiple positions on a single issue result in a gigantic number of resulting messaging options…” Know what that means? He says whatever you’ll respond to. Warn France. Warn Germany. And for goodness’ sake, stop giving these jerks so much information about yourself.","If by “your information,” you mean me, personally, I’m not so sure. I don’t have a personal Facebook page, don’t have a smartphone, rarely use cards.\nIf by “your information,” you are using me to represent the average reader, then sure. I wouldn’t consider myself average in this way, but it’s true that most people have already given up the information.\nI’m not a fight fire with fire person, really, so doubt I’d find myself taking that view, for better or for worse. I expect going on, though, political candidates will do as you have said.","And, currently, there is little way to know if we’re being duped too. How much of the barrage of negative coverage of his actions are attributable to this methodology? How much of the way reports are framed and specifically targeted are due to this? Do we know the details of every EO he’s signed so far? Do we know the details of his plans, or are we informed by the articles that we see in our social media and other feed-style outlets? We’re afraid of him, just like Trump supporters were afraid of Hillary. So we’re susceptible, and we need to keep that in mind. Emotionally driven political instability is a powerful strategy for control.","We are not afraid of him “just like Trump supporters were afraid of Hillary,” and here is why: neither of these people exist only in the present. We have their personal histories to consider. It’s not like no one ever looked into Hillary’s alleged wrongdoings. They did, vigorously and at length. She was cleared. There was a percentage of the populace that was unable to cope with that fact, and those people kept perpetuating the stories as if they were current scandal. They were not.","That is very, very different from the situation we have with Trump. Let’s say, for sake of argument, that we don’t have enough facts about Trump’s EOs or plans. Let’s say that we only have some facts. Considering his history, why are those facts not enough? He has a lifetime history of being just the kind of person who would sign EOs just like the ones he is now signing. How many more details do we need? How many data points are we supposed to wait for before we put our collective foot down? And how in the world have there not been enough already?","Even though you didn’t use these words, what I’m hearing from your comment is (1) the media may be misrepresenting him and (2) give him a chance. I hear “give him a chance” because if we wait for more and more data points, that is, by necessity, giving him a chance.","As for (1), he is not only represented by the media, he is represented by himself, continuously and at every opportunity, on Twitter and on the television. This is Trump. He has told us who he is. As for (2), no thanks.","We don’t need to have “emotionally driven political instability.” Feeling an emotion does not mean the same thing as being emotionally driven. Feeling an emotion (or even two) about a situation that is terrible does not mean the choice to end that situation is emotionally driven. And, why assume the removal of an unfit president would create instability? I would argue leaving an unfit president in office creates instability. We have procedures in place if we have a president who is unable to do the job so that it’s not a free-for-all when something like this happens. Let’s use them.","Here’s the dilemma: It’s impossible way to generate multiple contradictory actions to fit to the multiple contradictory promises. No, you can’t all have the biggest piece of cake, because now we’re dealing with Reality, not Wishful Thinking. And this is how cakes get utterly destroyed.\nWhere is Cambridge Analytics, now that they have done their job and been paid? As always, “Follow the money.” Seems clear to me: No one is paying to have targeted positive/negative messages about how the pres. tRump is performing, therefore Reality has a chance to assert itself, at least for now. Kellyanne Conway, as skillful a duck as she is (reality rolls off her back like water off a duck), is not as powerful without all the backup, targeted, subliminal messaging going on.\nWe are stuck with a tone-deaf egomaniac who listens only to syncophants, who do not even know the most basic things, like how a president should behave with our own CIA or with foreign leaders.","The media is not using this methodology. They would be much more persuasive if they were. For a lawyer, which I am, the executive orders are simple to understand. Especially the immigration one, since I’m an immigration lawyer. They are all that we fear and more. For a layperson, they are slightly more difficult, but understanding them is certainly possible if one makes the effort. If you don’t trust an article in a relatively respected publication, take the time to go to its sources, and if necessary, the sources of its sources. Check other articles on the same issues in publications with different viewpoints. I’ve done this over and over again and I have a feeling for the specific biases of each publication and where it might be, in order of most concerning to least: outright lying vs irresponsibly presenting unknowns vs leaving out details that don’t fit within their narrative vs choosing a position that they don’t have to take for a nebulous purpose vs only choosing to cover particular things to the omission of other things (hint: every publication does this last thing and it can certainly result in suppressing an important story like this one).","Reblogged this on alexpavlotski and commented:\nWow. Micro-marketing is probably where all researchers like myself are likely to go in the future. Who could have thought, our social network is the key to selling out our deepest secrets, and our confirmation bias means that we’ll buy an untrue story… if it’s pitched at exactly the right level.","Don’t you guys think that this is a natural (virtually unstoppable, only delayable) direction of evolution? It is impossible to cover your tracks in real life, also in virtual and arguably shouldn’t even be desirable by definition. Market saturation up ahead. How will the game change when everyone is using?","Isn’t this just mega-marketing and its natural consequence. If Americans were still supporting corner stores and small local businesses-in person-we would be encouraged toward individual thought. We would bounce ideas back and forth. With mega-marketing, individual thought and community banter are eliminated. The mega marketer is the only voice.","Reblogged this on Transports of Delight (and other things) and commented:\nI always knew that social media and the simple use of store cards could be problematic in some way, but mainly personally, or with a bit of targeted marketing for new products or services.","This article however, blows that right out of the water. We are indeed being monitored, tracked and targeted by organisations, particularly political ones, to get what they want. Trump, Brexit and others to follow – they will all use this and politics will be simply about who clicks ‘like’ on Facebook and what they post. Not much really about actual issues that need fixing, just who ever has the deepest pockets and wants ‘the power’.","Ordinary people don’t really have any response to this, other than to stop using social media and store cards and smart phones all together! Thats a big step!","Very enlightening article, many thanks for the translation to English. I am in the process of attempting a French translation of this article, will start on monday, any help greatly appreciated. Reply here if you want to get involved.","So, get everyone you know to fill in as many surveys as possible with erroneous information, like things they don’t and generally screw the data-collection process. Get that message out and the whole edifice will crumble.","❤ ❤ ❤\nThis made our day, thank you.\nTaking our version out of public circulation reduces the chance that the report's detractors (Cambridge Analytica themselves among them) can use small alleged inconsistencies to attack its authors.\nThat said, message us on our Facebook page if you'd like a private copy. Thank you for your kind words. Long live insurgent media!","While the facts seems pretty much the same after skimming theirs, and I’m not really sure what the clickbaitiness would consist of, I must say yours was richer, more nuanced. It felt much better to read, activated more thought and was thereby more memorable.\nAlthough I personally have no use for it, I want to point out that recommending people to use Facebook to request it seems very hypocritical.","It wouldn’t take much to make a metric in this system of a persons place on the scale of lawfulness, and at least keep extra surveillance on those scoring low, maybe even in the future pre-emptively put them in prison, Minority Report- style… See this old but valid article: http://falkvinge.net/2011/07/01/lawfully-good-lawfully-evil/","When I read your story on 1/22, I made a PDF of it thinking it would probably disappear at some point. Now I’m reading your translation side by side with the Vice translation. Yours is better, much better.","Why change “he saw that the bomb had gone off: defying the predictions of nearly every leading statistician” to “he saw that the bombshell had exploded: contrary to forecasts by all leading statisticians”? Your translation has so much more punch! Who says “the bombshell had exploded”? No one says that. They say “he dropped a bombshell.” Yours is a more powerful metaphor, likening a sophisticated system of innovative political marketing to a bomb, not a bombshell. Just a dumb change.","Or: “The meditative Kosinski, the well‐groomed Nix, the widely grinning Trump—one made this digital upheaval possible, one carried it out, and one rode it to power.” They changed this to: “Of these three players—reflective Kosinski, carefully groomed Nix and grinning Trump—one of them enabled the digital revolution, one of them executed it and one of them benefited from it.” Wow. Such boring word choice. One of them benefited from it. Seriously, why didn’t Vice just pay you for your translation?! Oh, well, maybe they could pay their own writers less, yes, that seems obvious.","And this: “It is therefore not at all the case, as is so often claimed, that statisticians lost this election because their polls were so faulty. The opposite is true: statisticians won this election. It was just certain statisticians, the ones using the new method. It is a cruel irony of history that Trump, who often grumbled about scientific research, used such a highly scientific approach in his campaign.” This became: “Many voices have claimed that the statisticians lost the election because their predictions were so off the mark. But what if statisticians in fact helped win the election—but only those who were using the new method? It is an irony of history that Trump, who often grumbled about scientific research, used a highly scientific approach in his campaign.” What if? What if? Your version is so much more decisive on the matter. “The opposite is true,” not, “What if.” And it’s not just “an irony of history,” it’s “a cruel irony of history!” Vice botched it all up. You guys are awesome. Your version was so much better. I’m glad I had the opportunity to read yours first.","I commend your honorable piracy….. but just FYI, from a language nerd’s standpoint completely divorced from politics… your translation was better. “I just showed that the bomb was there” has a WAY sweeter ring to it than “I only showed that it exists.” Your title was stuck in my head giving me shivers as I mused on this days later. Plus, “the same reaction Hochdeutsch elicits in some Swiss” –> your “the same mix of resentment and awe” was spot on; the Vice translation says Nix’s accent “puts Americans on edge just like Hochdeutsch does the Swiss”….. WTF? hahaha.","Come on Vice, play nicely – just say politely that it’s your property and it’s not appropriate for someone else to post it. No need for catty extra twists of the dagger like “and your translation is rough!” Because it wasn’t. It was better.","an·ti·dote (ăn′tĭ-dōt′)","Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.","1: a remedy to counteract the effects of poison","2: something that relieves, prevents, or counteracts","The Antidote Writers Collective seeks to resist and counteract the poisons that course through the veins of our politics, our cultures, our movements, our relationships, ourselves.","We believe that a strong collective immune system is built through knowledge and understanding and that the struggle against division and repression requires building a new culture of discussion that goes beyond flat definitions, brittle ideologies, stubborn dogmas, idle preconceptions, and petty rivalries.","We will share knowledge with each other, aiming to build empathy, and in turn enable the emergence of genuine solidarity—one which does not demand uniformity across contexts, one which does not “include” you, but in which you include yourself.","In this spirit, we will provide a platform for a diverse set of voices, especially for those otherwise silenced or ignored in “mainstream” discussions.

Visually, it looks like an ad-free stripped down version of Facebook that’s actually quite relaxing.","As I’m trying to reduce my exposure to social networks, I decided to take a look at this info.

Well, every time you tag a photo, you’re adding to an enormous, user-driven wealth of knowledge and data. Every day, billions of people are telling an algorithm what a human face looks like, from different angles, at different ages, and in different light conditions.","The result?

It requires 60 votes to pass.","During the first 14 months of the past four administrations - a span of 56 months under Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush - the Senate held 17 such votes, according to Short.","He promised that Trump would begin to speak out aggressively in response to what he called \"historic obstruction.\"","\"I think that perhaps I'm a warm-up act for him making a larger foray into this,\" Short told reporters.","He said Trump would \"make his case to the American people that the objection has gotten ridiculous.\"","A spokesman for Schumer on Friday blamed the administration and Senate Republicans for the backlog of nominees.","\"This administration has been historically slow in submitting nominations and has withdrawn more nominees in the first year than any of the past four administrations,\" said the Schumer aide.","The Democratic aide also noted there are currently 145 nominees awaiting action from Republican-controlled committees.","Trump has withdrawn more than 20 nominees and failed to submit nominations for key State Department posts such as the ambassadorships for Cuba, Egypt, Honduras, Iceland, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Sweden.","Senate Republicans are reaching out to Democrats in hopes they might agree to changing the Senate rules to shorten the amount of time it takes to process nominees.","Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) is spearheading that effort.","\"We're desperately behind on judges and noms,\" Lankford told The Hill. \"We've had a cloture vote 80 times. That's more than the last four presidents combined.\"","A Republican aide said Lankford \"has had some positive private conversations about this with Democrats, many of who realize that this trend is really, really bad.\"","But such bipartisan efforts have fallen short in the past, prompting speculation among some GOP senators that changing the rules with 51 votes - a controversial tactic known as the nuclear option - may be the only way to get something done.","\"We need to reduce the amount of post-cloture time for nominees. The amount of time we now spend is ridiculous,\" said one GOP senator who requested anonymity to discuss Tuesday's conversation with Pence.","Senate rules require 30 hours to elapse on the floor once the Senate votes to end dilatory debate on a nominee, which empowers the minority party to eat up the calendar by refusing to yield back time.","The use of the nuclear option - which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) employed last year to eliminate the Democrats' power to filibuster Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch - wouldn't likely happen until the next Congress.","Republicans control only 51 seats and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) hasn't voted since early December, reducing their effective majority to 50.","A single GOP defection would scuttle any attempt to change Senate precedent through a ruling of the chair, which needs to be sustained by a majority vote.","Republicans, however, hope to expand their majority. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) pointed to an Axios poll this week showing that if the election were held today, Republicans could capture as many as five Democratic-held seats.","In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published in August, Lankford argued for shrinking the amount of time required to elapse after cloture has been filed on executive nominees from 30 hours to eight or less.","He pointed out that the Senate adopted this expedited process for a short time in 2013 under former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who also invoked the nuclear option to eliminate filibuster for executive branch nominees and judicial nominees below the level of Supreme Court.","\"It worked then and it would work now,\" Lankford said of speeding up the time to debate nominees.","There is strong support among junior Republican senators for changing the rules.","\"The intention of the original filibuster and cloture was to allow for extended debate of issues, not for obstruction of a party's administration by delaying of nominee votes, so Sen. Perdue would like to see these rules changed,\" said Caroline Vanvick, a spokeswoman for Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.).","Democrats argue that Republicans slow-walked Obama's nominees once they gained control of the Senate.","Senate Republicans forced cloture votes on 168 of Obama's nominees, even though 62 of those nominees were later confirmed unanimously or by voice vote.","Democrats also argue that McConnell broke Senate tradition under Obama by holding up his nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Merrick Garland, for ten months until Trump took office."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals...

Whoever we ask, nobody seems to know anything. Did the study have ethical approval? First the answer was yes. Then it was no. Then it was maybe. Then it was no again. Was it funded by the US army? First the university said yes. Then it said no, without explanation. Why did the scientific journal not state whether the study was ethically approved, as required by its own policy? Sorry, editor Susan Fiske told me, I’m too busy to answer that question.","I’m referring of course to the study published last week by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in which researchers from Facebook and Cornell University teamed up to study \"emotional contagion\". Over a one-week period in 2012, they changed the content of news feeds for a random sample of Facebook users. For one group of users they removed content that contained positive words, for another group they removed content that contained negative words. They then measured whether subtly biasing the emotional content in this way changed the emotional content of status updates by the users. Sure enough it did. Making feeds more negative led to more negative behaviour, and vice versa.","Scientifically, the study is remarkable in some ways and unremarkable in others. The sample size of 689,003 is truly huge – possibly the largest in the history of psychology. And the results are interesting insofar as they show that very small changes in the emotional state of our environment can have knock-on effects for how we act (and presumably how we feel) in social networks. On the other hand, the effects in the study are minuscule, among the smallest statistically significant results ever published. As psychologist Tal Yarkoni has pointed out, were the effects to be expressed in terms of average human height, they would have an effect of just one 20th of an inch across the entire male population of the United States.","Yet what has driven this study into the spotlight isn’t the scientific implications – it is the fact that the researchers failed to obtain consent from the thousands of Facebook users who were subjected to the intervention. Informed consent is a core principle of human research ethics, established in the aftermath of the second world war. In important cases where the question is deemed vital and consent isn’t possible (or would prevent a fair test), it can be legally bypassed. But this is rare, and it is doubtful whether the Facebook study would qualify for such an exemption.","In this case, the researchers took advantage of the fine print in Facebook’s data use policy to conduct a scientific experiment without informed consent. Even though the academic researchers collaborated with Facebook in designing the study, it appears that they only obtained ethical approval after the data collection was finished. Then, since the data was already collected, the ethics committee in question seems to have awarded it an \"approval lite\". So it appears that the researchers rather cleverly exploited an ethical loophole.","I use terms like “appears” and “seems” because, bizarrely, these simple facts are not entirely clear and straight answers are hard to come by. Earlier this week I contacted Princeton University professor, Susan Fiske, who edited the study at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. According to the journal's own policy, ethical approval (known in the US as Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval) is a condition of publication, and the research must state which IRB gave the go ahead. Fiske was unable to tell me why the article failed to mention ethical approval, citing demands on her time. “I can’t because of sheer volume [of questions] and another deadline I have.” In a 115-word email that would have taken longer to write than the answer I asked for, Fiske added, “I judged that PNAS should not second-guess the relevant IRB.”","Even putting that judgment aside, to what IRB is Fiske referring? None is mentioned in the published article, and until last night no IRB had stepped forward to claim responsibility for the study. I also contacted the Cornell University IRB and the authors of the paper. On Monday evening, the university responded with the brief statement that because the academic researchers devolved responsibility for data collection and analysis to Facebook, they were \"not directly engaged in human research and that no review by the Cornell Human Research Protection Program was required\". This is in spite of the fact that the Cornell academics helped design the project. Meanwhile, the academics themselves have said nothing, relying on Facebook researcher Adam Kramer to issue vague comments that provide few answers. It seems they have descended into lockdown.","This situation is, quite frankly, ridiculous. In what version of 2014 is it acceptable for journals, universities and scientists to offer weasel words and obfuscation in response to simple questions about research ethics? How is it acceptable for an ethics committee to decide that the same authors who assisted Facebook in designing an interventional study to change the emotional state of more than 600,000 people did, somehow, \"not directly engage in human research\"?","Whether the study was ethically questionable is itself debatable, and there are no black-and-white answers. Those defending the study have pointed out, quite rightly, that Facebook and many other online companies routinely perform such studies for their own benefit or as part of social experiments. They don’t need our consent to do such research and nobody seemed to care before, so why such an uproar now when the findings are published in a scientific journal? Facebook may well have done the exact same experiment anyway, and by collaborating with scientists, aren’t they doing it in a way that is publicly transparent and beneficial? Critics warn that too strong a backlash might dissuade such companies from joining forces with science in the future.","These are important points but they overlook the fact that, for better or worse, publicly funded science is held to a higher ethical standard than comparable research in the private sector. Once academic scientists get involved the bar is raised, never lowered. In fact, if this case has highlighted anything, it is how marketing research can be so unregulated. The Facebook study paints a dystopian future in which academic researchers escape ethical restrictions by teaming up with private companies to test increasingly dangerous or harmful interventions.","Once the brouhaha dies down, the researchers in this case may well be left with one nagging question. How did a major online company, a prestigious scientific journal, and an Ivy League university all fail to see this coming? Were it not so amateurish, one might be tempted to think this is all a ruse – that the real experiment is watching how the world reacts to revelations that Facebook conducts covert experiments on its customers."],"isopubdate":"2014-07-01"}

In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready.

I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it).

We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make,’ Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post on Saturday.”","“The consent decree requires that Facebook notify users and receive explicit permission before sharing personal data beyond their specified privacy settings,” Salinas reports. “Shares of Facebook fell as much as 3 percent Tuesday, after falling as much as 8 percent on Monday. UK officials are also investigating the alleged mishandling of data, ordering auditors hired by Facebook to stand down and summoning CEO Mark Zuckerberg to provide evidence for review.”","“The Facebook revelations have also prompted bipartisan, transatlantic concern,” David McLaughlin reports for Bloomberg. “The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee announced Monday evening it would like a briefing on ‘the use and sharing of individual Facebook user data.'”","“The chairman of a UK parliamentary committee announced Tuesday he was requesting that Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, who has remained silent for days, appear before the panel to supplement prior testimony by the company’s executives,” McLaughlin reports. “Republican lawmakers, who normally resist regulation of private business, started coming down on the company as early as Sunday, with Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona calling the privacy violations ‘significant’ and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida saying he was ‘disturbed’ by many things about the company.”","17 Comments","More than 50 million Facebook users X $40,000 per violation = minimum $2 billion. Of course, Facebook will say the users set their configs to allow the sharing, so there will be no fine, except maybe a token fine for the sake of politicians running for re-election this fall.","Trump campaign phased out use of Cambridge Analytica data before election","The Trump campaign never used the psychographic data at the heart of a whistleblower who once worked to help acquire the data’s reporting — principally because it was relatively new and of suspect quality and value.","In late September 2016, Cambridge and other data vendors were submitting bids to the Trump campaign. Then-candidate Trump’s campaign used Cambridge Analytica during the primaries and in the summer because it was never certain the Republican National Committee would be a willing, cooperative partner. Cambridge Analytica instead was a hedge against the RNC, in case it wouldn’t share its data.","The crucial decision was made in late September or early October when Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital guru on the 2016 campaign, decided to utilize just the RNC data for the general election and used nothing from that point from Cambridge Analytica or any other data vendor. The Trump campaign had tested the RNC data, and it proved to be vastly more accurate than Cambridge Analytica’s, and when it was clear the RNC would be a willing partner, Mr. Trump’s campaign was able to rely solely on the RNC.","Your bold headline doesn’t jive with the bottom line of your cut-n-paste.","Of course the Trump contract with Cambridge Analytica ended on election day in 2016 — Trump wouldn’t pay for any data after that point. You have no idea how much data Bannon and the Boyz stole or how it was used. Note that Trump also kicked Bannon to the kerb after he felt he got all the strategy he needed out of the prickly Mercer plant.","Who pays you to write all the Trump propaganda? You work so hard to cherry pick data points that you think prove you correct, but you miss the forest of other data points, including the one in the article you pasted here on what used to be a Mac forum.","There is one obvious quality of all the (remaining) Trump administration: whether true or not, the lemmings will all swear before the public that if Trump thinks something is so, then it must be true. To prove him wrong leads to sacking, so nobody will question the naked emperor.","Problem is, Trump DOES rely on underhanded popularity based “alternative facts” to draw his conclusions. He just isn’t smart enough or patient enough to absorb what data analytics says. He gets his daily brief from the Morning Joe show and then tweets how all the national intelligence agencies that he could have working for him are untrustworthy because they don’t bend to Trump’s tenuous grasp of reality.","Note how Trump claims the US election was rigged against him, then he turns around and calls Russian dictator for life Putin to congratulate him on his “reelection”."],"isopubdate":""}

Facebook didn't confirm what posts were specifically responsible for the ban, but did say the group would be barred from creating a new page.","\"We do not do this lightly,\" said Facebook, \"but they have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups, which disqualifies the Pages from our service.\"","...","\"We have community standards that clearly state this sort of speech is not acceptable on Facebook and, when we become aware of it, we remove it as quickly as we can,\" the company added. “Political parties, like individuals and all other organisations on Facebook, must abide by these standards and where a page or person repeatedly breaks our community standards we remove them.” The group will also not be allowed to set up any further pages in future.","Back in December, President Trump bristled at this characterization of Britain First as a \"hate\" group when he elicited condemnations from UK Prime Minister Theresa May and other world leaders after he retweeted videos initially tweeted by Britain First. One video showed a Muslim migrant attacking a Dutch man; another showed a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. A third showed a man being pushed from the top of a building in Alexandria.","As the Guardian reported, Britain First was deregistered as a political party in November 2017.","And last week, Fransen and Golding (pictured above) were jailed for a series of hate crimes against Muslims.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts.

These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.","That support is a clear sign to lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 years old, and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms. But the demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform. They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment.","Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that “a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century.","For over 200 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment, it was uniformly understood as not placing any limit on either federal or state authority to enact gun control legislation. In 1939 the Supreme Court unanimously held that Congress could prohibit the possession of a sawed-off shotgun because that weapon had no reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a “well regulated militia.”","During the years when Warren Burger was our chief justice, from 1969 to 1986, no judge, federal or state, as far as I am aware, expressed any doubt as to the limited coverage of that amendment. When organizations like the National Rifle Association disagreed with that position and began their campaign claiming that federal regulation of firearms curtailed Second Amendment rights, Chief Justice Burger publicly characterized the N.R.A. as perpetrating “one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.”","In 2008, the Supreme Court overturned Chief Justice Burger’s and others’ long-settled understanding of the Second Amendment’s limited reach by ruling, in District of Columbia v. Heller, that there was an individual right to bear arms. I was among the four dissenters.","That decision — which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable — has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power. Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the N.R.A.’s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.","That simple but dramatic action would move Saturday’s marchers closer to their objective than any other possible reform. It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States — unlike every other market in the world. It would make our schoolchildren safer than they have been since 2008 and honor the memories of the many, indeed far too many, victims of recent gun violence.","Correction:","An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the 18th-century firearm depicted.

James Lankford, R-Okla., about how Russian bots are still flooding social media, including fomenting American tension over the Florida school shootings, and what he thinks should be done about it.","Russian Trolls Are Flooding Social Media With Messages Meant To Increase Tensions In U.S.","NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., about how Russian bots are still flooding social media, including fomenting American tension over the Florida school shootings, and what he thinks should be done about it.","MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:","The aftermath of a school shooting in Florida, NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem and the 2016 presidential election - these have all been targets of Russian internet trolls. Just hours after that Florida shooting last week, Russian bots got busy on social media posting pro-gun-rights messages, also posting pro-gun-control messages. It's the latest example of a phenomenon documented in special counsel Robert Mueller's indictment released on Friday of Russian trolls and bots working to deepen divisions in U.S. society. Oklahoma Republican Senator James Lankford has been talking about this since the NFL national anthem controversy last fall.","(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)","JAMES LANKFORD: They were taking both sides of the argument this past weekend and pushing them out from their troll farms as much as they could to try to just raise the noise level in America and to make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they're trying to push divisiveness in the country.","KELLY: Senator Lankford predicted then that we would continue to see this happening, and we have. Senator Lankford sits on the intelligence committee, and he joins me now. Welcome to the program.","LANKFORD: Glad to be able to be with you today.","KELLY: I want to follow on something we just heard you say there in that tape from last fall. You said that the troll farms - Russian troll farms are working to try to just raise the noise level. Is that the goal? Do we know what Russia wants?","LANKFORD: What Russia seems to want is divisiveness everywhere else, and they try to get a competitive advantage by destabilizing every country around them. They've done it for years, and they've finally come here.","KELLY: And they continue to be able to continue doing it. Despite efforts to look at what happened in 2016 and prevent that going forward in 2018, what specific steps do you want social media companies to take?","LANKFORD: So the first thing that they can do is be able to identify these Russian trolls and these bots. They have started that process. They've been aggressive about putting some algorithms in place to deal with it, and that is very helpful to everyone. When you have a conversation, we have a lot of areas to disagree on. And that is fine. We're not going to agree on every issue, but we don't need Russian interference in the middle of our disagreement.","KELLY: On the other hand, this is continuing even within these last several days in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. Does that discourage you. Or to put it another way, is there a certain level of this that Americans maybe just need to get used to?","LANKFORD: So we will get used to it over the years. And one of the other things that can be of greatest benefit is identifying what it looks like and where it comes from in the past so people can see it. When you come through the grocery store line and you see the tabloids that are there and you see the headlines, you understand they're just tabloids, and they're just putting out sensational information. And you don't treated the same as you do a Wall Street Journal or New York Times or other periodical that is a reputable periodical. We need to be able to gain that ability with what we're seeing online and identify that, hey, that's just Russian noise, and we can blow it off.","KELLY: We've been talking about steps you would like to see social media companies take. What about steps the government should take? And let me start at the top. We mentioned the Robert Mueller indictment came out on Friday, charged 13 Russians and three companies for interfering in the 2016 election. President Trump has not come out following that and condemned Russian interference. Does that bother you?","LANKFORD: Well, I would certainly hope that he would do that when all the information is out and the indictments are done because there's no question that the Russians worked to interfere in our election. They were...","KELLY: And this is a 37-page indictment that does lay out a lot of facts and specific details. Do you have any insight into why President Trump has not come out and condemned?","LANKFORD: You know, I don't know. I have heard President Trump speak about his frustration that some in the media try to make it appear that the only reason he won the election is because of Russian interference. I don't believe that's so. Mueller is not saying that. No one is trying to accuse of any votes being shifted. But there's also a reality.","They were engaged in the election as far back as 2014. They were actively working against Hillary Clinton, but they were working for obviously Trump. They're working for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. They were working for Bernie Sanders. They were doing everything they could to be able to raise volume and to be able to increase any kind of reach of anyone that they thought was going to be divisive.","KELLY: Senator, President Trump has also tweeted a couple of things that could be read as critical of the Russia probes that are underway, including the one that you're working on with the Senate Intelligence Committee. He tweeted over the weekend about, quote, \"all the committee hearings and investigations.\" And then he added - and excuse my language - but he added, quote, \"they are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart, America.\" He seems to be suggesting the Russian probe should end. What's your response?","LANKFORD: Well, I would hope that's not so. I think the Russia probe should end when the - all the evidence is in and is done and we can wrap up and give a complete report 'cause this benefits the future of the country. Again, the intelligence services saw some of these things as far back as 2014. There wasn't a reaction from the previous administration. There wasn't an aggressive confrontation with the Russians on this behind the scenes and to say knock it off other than just a verbal statement. We need to learn from that and to be able to know, what do we need to do to protect our election security in the future? How can we confront this in the days ahead, and what lessons can be learned? That can only be done once we complete the report and get it all out there in the public.","KELLY: Senator Lankford, thanks very much.","LANKFORD: You bet. Glad to be able to be with you.","KELLY: James Lankford - Republican from Oklahoma and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.","NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by Verb8tm, Inc., an NPR contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with NPR.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The backlash forced Facebook to once again defend the way it protects user data.","Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data “to target political advertising and manipulate voters.”","The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual US voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many US states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack of oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement Sunday, Wylie described himself as “a curious and naive 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said Sunday, Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also Saturday, the two top congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Rep.

But This One Is Different.","text":["Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has everything: peculiar billionaires, a once-adored startup turned monolith, a political mercenary who resembles a Bond villain and his shadowy psychographic profiling firm, an eccentric whistleblower, millions of profiles worth of leaked Facebook data, Steve Bannon, the Mercers, and — crucially — Donald Trump, and the results of the 2016 presidential election.","On its face, the incident read as confirmation of many people’s worst fears — that the online platforms we live on are manipulating us, using the personal information we provided in good faith without our knowledge. Add to it that one of those many unintended outcomes could have been Donald Trump’s election and you’ve got the makings of a lasting outrage.","While the main players in the scandal — Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Trump — will occupy headlines, they’re just the context — the perfect conditions for genuine outrage. But the Cambridge Analytica scandal isn’t really about Cambridge Analytica at all.","This is a data collection scandal. This is a scandal triggered by a specific incident, but that is broadly about the ways massive companies track us, harvest information from us, and then sell us as coercion targets in sophisticated information campaigns that could be for anything from diapers to mattresses to anti-vax literature.","The story will endure not because of animosity toward political data use but because it perfectly touches upon a deeper anxiety about our online privacy that’s been building for years. Indeed, the Cambridge Analytica scandal could well be the catalyst for a much bigger targeting revolt — a full-scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we’ve used the internet for the last decade. It’s a moment that forces us, collectively, to step back and think about what we sacrificed for a more convenient and connected world. And on an internet that feels increasingly toxic it’s hard to look at the tradeoffs we’ve made and feel like we’re getting a fair deal.","2. This is every place I have been in the last twelve months in Ireland, going in so far as the time of day I was in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT","You can see this reckoning already begin play out across the media as the focus shifts from Cambridge Analytica’s deeds to more general concerns about privacy and the degree to which our personal lives are catalogued so that we can be targeted by anyone with a dollar (or ruble) to spend online. Over the weekend, Ars Technica reported that Facebook has long requested access to contacts, SMS data, and call history on Android devices, hiding behind a confusing opt-in page as cover.","On Twitter, Facebook users are downloading their data and combing through it to highlight various abuses of trust: that the company kept a record of private phone calls and text message data or that Facebook shared personal information with outside entities for ad purposes. Download your own Facebook, Google, and YouTube data and you'll find years’ worth of personal information: every photo, comment, sticker emoji, video you've ever posted online; every location you’ve visited and IP address you’ve logged in from; every search, every file, and every single website you visited. It's binary confirmation of something we perhaps all have silently suppressed. Every movement you make online — and even where you move about in the world — is fastidiously catalogued, analyzed, and ultimately sold.","Ok @Google. I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway. See recent videos I watched! I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS? 😖😡🤬 https://t.co/NdJqEYfQIV","In the wake of this revolt, a 2010 clip of Steve Jobs talking about privacy has found new resonance in recent days. In an interview with journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, Jobs is asked to weigh in on a then-recent Facebook scandal and lays out his feelings on user privacy, as Mark Zuckerberg looks on in the audience. “Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly,” he says. “I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.”","Today, the clip is presented as a face-to-face warning from Jobs to Zuckerberg and as proof of sorts that Facebook knew exactly what sort of surveillance tools it was building. Indeed, Facebook’s history of privacy scandals makes the current revelations feel all the more flagrant.","In 2007, Zuckerberg first apologized for its controversial Beacon ad program, which tracked purchases on outside sites and posted that information onto a user’s News Feed. “Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. Three years later, in a sweat-filled interrogation at another D conference, Zuckerberg repeatedly dodged direct questions about Facebook’s cavalier attitudes toward privacy. More than 11 years after Beacon, Facebook is still behaving recklessly with our personal information and still making the same apologies — the only difference is that this time the advertising systems are far more complicated and the apologies come in full-page ads in the New York Times.","The Great Targeting Revolt isn’t just about the platforms; some in the ad industry are coming clean too. On Sunday the Verge published an editorial by a former digital marketer suggesting that Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the iceberg. “The contemporary Internet runs on the exploitation of user data,” the author wrote, before citing examples of corporations flagrantly flaunting user privacy to extract data. It may seem obvious but the revelation is profound and the language is important. Marketing is passive but targeting is active and invasive. A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted. Cambridge Analytica, the piece argues, isn’t an outlier but the blueprint for the internet’s vast online ad economy.","A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted.","Now in its second week, the size of the scandal is still unclear. We know that data obtained by a researcher was improperly shared with political consultants and that Cambridge Analytica did not delete the data upon Facebook’s request, but there’s a whole lot we don’t know for sure. Is this sort of improper data sharing an isolated incident or is this just part of a systemic information-control problem inside Facebook? Did the data get passed around to data brokers, states, or other companies besides SCL and Cambridge Analytica? Was the specific profile data used in any way to help target voters in the 2016 election? More importantly, is this data actually as useful in persuading voters as the targeting firms would have us believe? And are the people at Cambridge Analytica the psychographic targeting evil geniuses they claim to be? Or is it all just a bunch of bullshit — less “mindfuck tool” and more midlevel marketing?","There’s evidence to suggest that the Cambridge Analytica team were, at the very least, likely overselling their influence. “When we first saw the pitch the first thought was ‘Why would I pay all this money for this stuff when I could just get our guy from Facebook to do this kind of thing for us?’” a former senior Trump campaign official told BuzzFeed News. And some researchers and psychologists are dubious about the effectiveness of the Facebook data in political ad targeting. Speaking to Wired UK, one researcher argued that psychographic profiling is light on actual science. Another professor who studied voter behavior inside Facebook between 2010 and 2015 told the publication that the Facebook data gathered through questionnaires like Cambridge Analytica’s “may not measure what you really care about” and could have actually corrupted the ad targeting data the company had previously collected.","But none of that may matter much anymore at this point. The scandal feels like a watershed moment no matter how effective Cambridge Analytica may have been. Not only has the outrage endured more than a full week of news cycles, but it seems now as if in it the Big Tech backlash has reached a critical mass, sparking an unprecedented crisis. It’s caught the eye of lawmakers across the world — Zuckerberg has been summoned by Parliament in the UK and asked to testify in Congress by multiple senators; Facebook is now under an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission about its mishandling of Cambridge Analytica data; and across the world, company executives are getting skewered by governments in nations like the UK and, worse, Singapore, where officials suggest the company has lost their trust. It’s prompted more direct talk — even from Zuckerberg himself — of regulation. Anti-monopoly advocates are calling on the FTC to restructure Facebook, suggesting a spinoff of Facebook’s ad network and even the reversal of the company’s WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions to make them competing social networks. It even appears that inside Facebook itself there’s confusion and a sense of dwindling morale. And while the blowback isn’t enough to unseat Facebook in the App Store, regular, loyal Facebook users around the world have put momentum behind a #DeleteFacebook campaign — a novel act of online rebellion despite plenty of previous privacy scandals.","Some news events unexpectedly break through and take on new lives and trigger genuine, lasting movement. Moments like these are impossible to predict or control. The Parkland school shooting this February wasn’t an outlier in terms of casualties or sheer scale of horror and yet that particular tragedy’s aftermath was a breaking point and prompted a full-throated rejection of the status quo. The Parkland students were simply fed up. Fed up with the notion of not having control over their own safety. Fed up with a system in which victims of gun violence seemingly have no agency.","While the situations are drastically different, the frustration at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is similarly about agency and control. For years we’ve read about privacy scandals from the NSA’s Prism program to the data breaches everywhere from Equifax to Ashley Madison. We’re no stranger to the warnings that the platforms we live on harvest our data and that every detail of our online activities acts as the oil that powers the internet’s economic engine and that there’s little we can do, save for opting out completely. But this one lays bare the downsides of this tradeoff — how, despite their pledge to empower us, the platforms we live on have done just the opposite and stripped us of the agency to dictate what happens with our most personal information. Maybe it’s because Facebook feels so personal or because the 2016 election was so divisive, but this scandal is shaping up to be the event that forces the scales to fall from our eyes. We’ve lost control. And we’re fed up.","Every revolution needs to be ignited. Cambridge Analytica feels a lot like a spark.","If you want to read more about Facebook’s data scandal,subscribe to Infowarzel, a BuzzFeed News newsletter by the author of this piece, Charlie Warzel.","Charlie Warzel is a Senior Technology Writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in Missoula, Montana"],"isopubdate":""}

Some in social media do not want the truth out or any differing opinions that do not support their communist/progressive, NWO agenda. Therefore, ‘FB jail time’, blocking and banning are happening more and more often.","FB put me in jail for 30 days for a post that I wrote years ago and it was not anything but my opinion about how ‘some’ homosexuals behave which is my right to have and to express. So now, FB is going back in time to find anything that they can to shut up conservatives, Christians, white people and heterosexuals. Anything against DACA, Muslims, Sharia Law, illegals – post anything about an aspect concerning gun control, homosexuals, transexuals, women’s march – women who wear vaginas on their heads – being in support of President Trump – anything against Hillary, Dems, progressives, NWO are deemed as going against ‘FB community standards’. While FB allows verbal abuse of conservatives from terrorists, gays, dems, muslims, lib/dem/ progressives, etc. and allows them to post horrible even threatening things and not be censored. FB allows all sorts of perversions to be displayed and if you are against them – you are thrown into FB jail and ‘punished’ – censored – as if you are some school child.","Censorship for agenda must be stopped. It is against our First Amendment Rights and is why our forefathers stated it as such – in order to curtail censorship for agenda before it begins and to allow freedom of speech for all – not just a few. When people are not allowed to express differing opinions then we are under a communistic rule and dictatorship coming from some in the social media, etc.","Political correctness is nothing but Censorship. ‘PC and so-deemed hate speech’ are being taken way too far and being used as control of free expression and free speech. It’s for the evil agenda of perversion and control of the masses. FB even wants an app for children – so their agenda can be imprinted as early as possible – so addiction to technology and that brainwashing can begins earlier and earlier – the sick twisted desire of rule, dominate and control to implement their agenda over the masses.","FB should be cited, sued, fined, etc. for curtailing freedom of speech and expression. According to Zuckerberg, FB was started as a place for people to communicate and share expression. Now, it’s become a place to promote Zuckerberg’s agenda as he censors anyone against it – curtailing FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS for those ‘they deem’ going against ‘their agenda’. FB is un-American, about control and about ‘their’ agenda while they make money off ‘everyone’ who uses their communistic-run site. People are punished at FB’s whim without due recourse or way to communicate. Those in protest are not even listened to – I have contacted FB hundreds of times, after I have been thrown in ‘their FB censorship jail’ and no one ever responds. Being on FB is like North Korea – being on there, we are under the dictates of a wimpy little dick-ta-tor of control, arrogance and agenda. Zuckerberg is now creating a household computer- ‘butler’- like robot and he has made it so that it only listens to his voice and not his wife’s. This man is an out-of-control dick-ta-tor and needs to be thrown in jail for being a traitor to American freedoms.","Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg are a menace to a free society. He curtails freedom of speech and freedom of expression and uses his site to promote progressive communism to try to weaken America, flood her with illegals, muslims and refugees who hate our country, in order to created chaos – thus enabling the progressive agenda of control to insert a weakened America into the NWO under the rule of the UN – where all rights will come through them and they have control over all earth’s resources, land, property and people. Completely against freedom – all about the evil of control.","I am sharing this. I think FB needs to be shut down. I agree with you Ayn. It’s gotten way out of control. My friends on FB are continually being censored while FB allows all sorts of crap from libs. It’s getting worse every day.","Exactly, Ayn. They prey on the impressionable and naive in order to both advance their self serving delusional socialist new world agenda and for profit, all the while preaching righteousness. Despicable!","You’re right, I had to fight the algorithm to leave a comment on the post of Barack Obama’s new Netflix deal. The app literally closed on me 5 or 6 times before I figured out I had to click on the article to open it again before leaving a comment. I was just trying to say something about Noam Chomsky and that apparently pissed off the app!","This is but a small taste of what is coming in the very near future. Now that the US government has essentially turned over control of the Internet to ICANN, the change will seem gradual, but the end result inevitable. Keep in mind: entities outside of the US are not bound by nor do they care much about our Constitutional protections.","More and more are being blocked now. It’s my belief that Facebook is trying to eliminate conservative postings for the upcoming Midterm Elections. They realize they’ve created a monster that has put Trump in the White House and has taken over the Congress.\nThe latest survey indicates that people spend 25% less time on Facebook now since the leftist Facebook purge started by COO Sandberg (pro-Hillary globalist). It’s because more people are being blocked.","WARNING – You’re being sucked into a form of thought molding by Facebook. They let you talk to your friends via posts, free video conferencing and free phone calls. If they block you for something they disagree with you lose all contact with the outside world. You can’t let yourselves rely on this one liberal globalist platform. They block you now for words you’ve used all your life and are not against any US law, but violates this so called globalist hate speech policing that has come from the feckless European globalists that have given up on Capitalism and national pride.","When Obama was pres he met with Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg has been given marching orders to shut conservatives up. They were shocked at how the people rallied behind Trump using social media. This wasn’t in their plans. Now they are out to get conservatives. I got off facist book. I got sick of the double standard.","Call the Federal Trade Commission and file a Formal Complaint. Their Community Standards are Bogus.

You've seen that quiz going around that all your friends seem to be taking. It's a personality quiz, and that's right up your alley. But, wait a second. Before you take it, you might want to think twice.","Just recently, there was a scary survey going around on Facebook that wound up being a huge security threat. The survey was called \"10 Concerts I've Been To,\" and the scammers were using it to learn the answer to users' login security questions. If you missed the full story, click here for all of the details.","Privacy is the name of the game","We get it. These quizzes are fun. We all enjoy taking them, but they can also have a negative effect on your privacy. Just like the example previously mentioned, developers of these Facebook quizzes could use them to access the details listed in your Facebook profile, including your religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, photos, groups you're part of, events you've attended and more.","Even if you're not a big quiz taker yourself, you probably have Facebook friends who are. And, in some cases, when your friends take or share a quiz the developers could gain access to the details in your profile. Now that's scary.","Hiding in plain sight","It's important to point out that, in most cases, people who take these Facebook quizzes actually give the developers permission to access this information without even knowing it.","Have you ever seen something like this pop up before you've downloaded a Facebook app, or taken a Facebook Quiz?","The thing is, some people get so excited about the quiz itself that they forget to read the fine print. If you look closely, just above the \"Allow\" button is a statement that says, \"Allowing [quiz name] access will let it pull your profile information, photos, your friends' info, and other content that it requires to work.\" And just beneath the \"Allow\" button is a statement that says, \"By proceeding, you are allowing [quiz name] to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use.\"","But how often do you stop to read through the Facebook Terms of Use? Or any disclosure statement, for that matter?","Beyond the disclaimers that are mentioned by the developers, Facebook also includes the following disclaimer on its Privacy Update page:","\"When you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Services, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use the Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website may get information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from their website on Facebook. In addition, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your Public Profile, which includes your username or user ID, your age range and country/language, your list of friends, as well as any information that you share with them. Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies.\"","That last sentence is really scary. \"Subject to their own terms and policies,\" is Facebook's way of warning you that third-party developers may have a different set of rules that they follow.","This is why it's extremely important that you always read that fine print to see exactly what it is you're agreeing to.","Other risks of Facebook quizzes","It's safe to say that not all of the quizzes you see on Facebook are proven scams. In fact, many of them are legitimate quizzes that are fun and harmless. But keep in mind, scammers are hoping their scams won't stand out, which is what makes them so difficult to spot. Here are some additional ways scammers use quizzes to trick you.","Credit card fraud: If a quiz offers you some type of reward for taking it - or worse, asks you to pay - be extremely skeptical. If you're asked to enter any identifying information about yourself or your credit card number, it's likely a scam.","Malware: Scammers are smart when it comes to hiding malicious code in places you wouldn't suspect, and quizzes are prime targets. Links, images and other elements within these quizzes may be laced with viruses that can infect your computer, phone or tablet.","How to protect yourself","Be aware: Quizzes are one of the easiest tools fraudsters can use because they're so popular. They spread rapidly as people share them. With that in mind, be skeptical of any quiz that shows up in your feed. Look into it first, before you participate.","Keep your privacy settings tight: If you haven't updated your Facebook Privacy Settings in a while, it's a good idea to check them out now. Under \"Who can see my stuff?\" click \"Friends,\" or, \"Only me.\" It's also a good idea to review your Activity Log and edit posts you've been tagged in.","Remove details from your profile: Facebook asks you all sorts of questions when you set up your profile, but that doesn't mean you should answer them. In fact, less is more when it comes to what you share since much of your profile information is automatically public. Your profile photo, for example, can be seen by anyone. So can other details you list, such as where you went to school, where you grew up, where you work, etc. Click here for five critical details you should never share on Facebook, even if you're asked to.","When in doubt, play it safe: If you're not sure whether or not a quiz is safe, it's probably best not to click on it."],"isopubdate":""}

(And some settings are disappearing.) I am updating this post as I discover more settings. If you desire, you can just skip to the updates and the new settings that I've found.","Unless you have been hiding in a hole somewhere, and NOT on Facebook, then you will know about the blowup that is going on about how the Facebook app seems to be accessing information from outside its app — in particular contact details. It's not surprising that people are all up in arms over this. This sort of information should be private, and Facebook should only be accessing information that we've given them permission to access.","Cue the evil doer music, because... Guess what... You did give permission for Facebook to access that information when you installed the Facebook or Facebook Messenger app on your phone. And permission wasn't given by installing the app. Permission was given by a hidden setting that syncs your contact details on your phone with Facebook. Here's the kicker... The setting is set to ON by default — sort-of.","There is actually a dialog that asks if you want to sync your contacts, but the only options it gives is Learn More and OK. How is the average user supposed to know that buried at the bottom of the Learn Moreoption is a tiny Not Now link? So most people hit OK, and presto... You just gave Facebook permission to access your contacts list.","But not all hope is lost. Here's how you can change it, and remove your contracts list from Facebook, without uninstalling the apps — not that uninstalling the apps would remove your contacts list from Facebook anyway.","Stop that Mobile Device from Syncing Contacts","Before you go into the back end of Facebook to sanitize your contacts list from the system, you might want to stop your mobile device from syncing your contacts. This needs to be done on EVERY mobile device that you use separately, and you do it from the phone or tablet.","Be sure that you are following the instructions for the right type of device, be it an Android or running on iOS. Both instructions are given.","Instructions for Android","Open your Facebook Messenger app.","Select your profile image in top, right-hand corner.","From the menu that comes up, select People.","Ensure that Sync contacts is Off.","I also have Continuous Call and SMS Matching set to Off too, but that's my choice.","Select People on the your Messenger Profile","Ensure that Sync contacts is set to Off","However, there is a second setting in the main Facebook app.","Open the main Facebook app.","Select the three-line menu button from the top toolbar and scroll down to App Settings.","Ensure that Continuous Contacts Uploadis set to OFF.","Select App Settings on the main Facebook app menu","Ensure Continuous Contacts Upload is set to OFF","You can clean the contacts that you had inadvertently added to Facebook through your Android device, but to save on space within this post, I elected to provide information on how to do this through the web. That information is included at the bottom of this post.","Instructions for iOS","Open your Facebook Messenger app.","Select your profile image in top, left-hand corner.","From the menu that comes up, select People.","Ensure that Sync contacts is Off.","Select People on the your Messenger Profile (scroll down)","Ensure that Sync Contacts is set to Off","However, there is a second setting in the main Facebook app.","Open the main Facebook app.","Select the three-line menu button from the bottom toolbar (right-hand side) and scroll down to Settings.","Select Account Settingsfrom the popup menu.","Select General.","Select Upload contacts. (Just trust me here.)","Ensure that Upload Contactsis set to OFF.","Select Settings on the main Facebook app menu","Select Account Settings","Select General","Select Upload contacts (Just trust me here)","Ensure that Upload Contacts is set to OFF","Now it's time to ensure that you remove all those contact details from Facebook.","Remove Contacts Details via the Web","To clean your contacts details from Facebook, you will need to visit each of the following pages in turn.","Delete your Invite History","At first, it will appear as though it didn't work. Trust me, it has. It can take a few minutes for Facebook to wake up and realize that you have asked it to do something.","Be advised that this DOES NOT delete your Friends list.","Note: The system should also say Syncing is disabled.","Delete your Synced Contacts","Other Ways to Protect Yourself on Facebook","Followers of my blog will know that I'm a BIG fan of protecting yourself online: protect yourself and your reputation. All of your actions need to be with that in mind. However, so many of us are quick to take the easy road.","A large number of sites now provide the option of logging into the site using Facebook. Think before you do this. The moment you do, you give Facebook the right to access any information about your activities on that site. Is this really want you want to do?","Even those quizzes and joke programs want you to login with Facebook. Games give rewards for logging into Facebook.","People, it's NOT worth it.","If you want to clean out the apps that are accessing Facebook, or vice versa, you can do this from Android, iOS, and a web browser.","On Android and iOS, you will find the connected apps under the Account Settings.","On a web browser, the connected apps can be viewed from the Settings option from the drop-down menu on the main toolbar.","Be careful which apps that you disconnect. Some will be your publicize features for your blogs, if you have one.","On the Apps page on all three, you will also find another setting called Apps others use. This will determine what information from your personal profile that you allow your Friends to take with them when they use one of those external apps that accesses Facebook. (I have all options on my profile disabled.)","Update: 29/03/18 1:40pm","Within less than 12 hours of this post going live, Facebook had updated their systems (Android, iOS and web), such that the Apps others use features had been removed. The scary thing: there is now no way to ensure that others aren't inadvertently sharing your information. I hope this means that Facebook is now disabling the information sharing across the ENTIRE network. I'm only guessing here, but I believe that this removal of feature is in response to the probably court action that Facebook is now facing due to breach of privacy.","There is a new feature called Game and App Notifications that relates to whether friends are allowed send you game requests or app updates from programs linked into Facebook. My recommendation: set this to OFF. However, if you have a website that is provides links to your Facebook page, or is posting blog post announcements on your page, don't turn off Apps, websites and games. If you do, you will encounter issues with your website.","Another Update: 30/03/18 12:50pm","Facebook is clearly on the update task, trying to do some damage control with regards to these security breaches. Well, this morning, playing around and looking at settings, I discovered a whole NEW bunch of possible security risks. Under the Apps settings, as discussed above, you will find something called Logged in with Facebook. This will show you the individual external apps that have access to various components of your Facebook account.","DON'T just delete these apps willy-nilly. Some have specific purposes, e.g., on my own list, there is a specific app that allows my tablet to access my Facebook, without it, my tablet and Facebook will cease talking to one another; and I have apps that allow my blog to post to Facebook when new posts go out, and provide the ability to put MailChimp signup forms on my public Facebook pages.","However, there is zero reason why Mailchimp or WordPress needed access to my Friends List. Yes, folks, I too had fallen into this security trap and had no idea it had happened. Let's just say that the moment I discovered the setting, I corrected the issue.","In general, the security risks on Facebook are actually because people are not fully aware of what security options exist and what they do. However, when it comes to protecting yourself online, you need to take a proactive stance. Only you can really protect you.","Discover more Hidden Traps","While this particular trap was not included in my book Hidden Traps, you will find a whole range of other risks that writers, and other online personalities, could be falling into without knowing it.","At the end of the day, it's about protecting yourself and your reputation.","There are so many different elements that go into forming an online platform, but there are many traps that writers are unaware of. Are your social media posts just links with a few disjointed words, making you look like someone who can’t complete a sentence? Were you hit with charges you never expected when you created that website?

It aims to help political parties target voters with tailored messaging, based on information gleaned from a variety of sources.","A pair of bombshell articles hit on the weekend—one from the Observer and the other from the New York Times—alleging that Cambridge Analytica surreptitiously acquired data on 50 million Facebook users. The data was apparently collected through a personality-test Facebook app that was devised by a University of Cambridge academic called Aleksandr Kogan, with Wylie’s help.","The Observer described Wylie as a Cambridge Analytica employee at the time the data was taken, in 2014, although the company asserts he was a contractor. Either way, he says he helped build Cambridge Analytica’s “psychological warfare” tool.","And now Facebook (fb) has suspended Wylie’s accounts on the social network and on Instagram, which it owns. Carole Cadwalladr, the British journalist who spearheaded both the Observer and NYT‘s Cambridge Analytica exposés, tweeted that Wylie was also banned by WhatsApp, which Facebook also owns, but WhatsApp contacted Fortune on Monday to say this was not the case.","As Wylie notes there, Facebook stands accused of knowing for two years that Cambridge Analytica had broken its rules—and quite possibly some laws—but did not inform its users that their personal data had been taken.","Facebook told CBS News that “Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account.”","“Given he said he ‘exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,’ we cannot do this at this time,” the company said.","Whether or not Facebook was justified in suspending Wylie’s accounts, to do so now is not a good look. Cadwalladr said on Twitter that banning the whistleblower was an “unconscionable” move on Facebook’s part.","Back in 2014, it was possible for the maker of a third-party Facebook app to get their hands on the details of the friends of all those people who voluntarily used the app—as happened with Kogan’s personality test, where only 320,000 people actually used it. However, Facebook removed that capability not long after. According to Wylie, Facebook allowed Kogan to take all of this data at the time because he claimed it was for academic use.","Kogan is a faculty member at both the University of Cambridge and St Petersburg University. Cambridge Analytics denies still having the data he took, and also denies that it was used in the company’s work for Donald Trump’s campaign ahead of the 2016 election.","This article was updated to note WhatsApp’s denial that it suspended Wylie’s account.","SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT","You May Like","Read More","Sign Up for Our Newsletters","Sign up now to receive FORTUNE's best content, special offers, and much more."],"isopubdate":""}

This was back when Wired was actually cutting edge and not the insufferable Silicon Valley stroke job it became after Conde Naste acquired it. In it our antihero “Stark” finds himself inexplicably recruited as a kind of data scout, looking for viable consumer trends emerging from the fully immersive, all encompassing data field known as “The Spew”.","“When a schmo buys something on the I-way it goes into his Profile, and if it happens to be something that he recently saw advertised there, we call that interesting, and when he uses the I-way to phone his friends and family, we Profile Auditors can navigate his social web out to a gazillion fractal iterations, the friends of his friends of his friends of his friends, what they buy and what they watch and if there’s a correlation.”","The Spew of course, was the near future analogy of where the internet was headed, and when I went looking to link to it for this post, the piece turned out to be written by none other than Neal Stephenson. That means I read “Hack The Spew” and it made an impression on me before I even knew who Stephenson was or perhaps was on his way to becoming. Few would argue that Stephenson has a gift for seeing the general ambience of our oncoming future. Cryptonomiconuncannily anticipated the impetus toward crypto-currencies; the current systemic dysfunction of national sovereignty worldwide was foretold in Snow Crash; so it follows that all this will likely culminate in something that resembles The Diamond Age.","Today, “The Spew” is not equivalent to the Internet itself, but it is more accurately analogous to say the social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, especially when combined with the twin monopolies of Google and Amazon, collectively are: The Spew.","It is like a global garbage pile of digital flotsam and jetsam, over which peasants scurry around and scour, looking for some morsel here, a crumb there, which can be monetized. If a trend or a trait is detected, even better. Those can be aggregated, syndicated, federated, even rehypothecated and at scale that can yield staggering financial payoffs and perhaps, even steer the course the history.","At least that’s the narrative since the Cambridge Analytica scandal blew up in Facebook’s …face. After a long string of successive privacy fails (a.k.a a pattern of abuse?) this time feels different, as if the chickens are finally coming home to roost for Facebook.","Cambridge Analytica is not unique","Ever heard of Kareem Serageldin? Probably not.","To date, he is the only banker to have been sent to prison in connection with the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis for his role in issuing fraudulent mortgage-backed securities (at least outside of Iceland). To be sure, he was a fall guy, a token sacrifice to demonstrate contrition for what was a systemic, institutionalized effort to inflate a bubble whose implosion nearly crashed the entire global financial system.","In this case while Facebook attempted to throw water on this crisis by ceremonially banishing Cambridge Analytica from its system, the longstanding pattern of abuse remains, and is perhaps now, finally, awareness of that is reaching critical mass with the public:","And while there were key differences in the way data was used, (not to mention more informed consent) the 2012 Obama re-election campaign used the same data mining features and accessed the same data as the Cambridge Analytica app","In fact it may be veritably baked into their ecosystem to such a degree that it is almost impossible to develop and create an app on Facebook that doesn’t harvest your data","“At this point, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s pattern on privacy is clear. Launch new stuff that pushes the boundaries of what people consider comfortable. Apologize and assure users that they control their information, but rarely pull back entirely, and usually reintroduce similar features at a later date when people seem more ready for it.”","It becomes clear, as Futurist (and easyDNS member) Jesse Hirsh made this point on Steve Pakin’s “The Agenda” over the weekend: “Facebook ships with all privacy enhanced settings disabled” — further, my personal findings are that they use obfuscation to make it harder to disable data sharing settings. You have to jump through hoops to do it.","Should you #deleteFacebook?","WhatsApp founder Brian Acton, who became a billionaire when Facebook bought his company hasn’t let that dissuade him from telling the world what he thinks of all this:","Should you? Should easyDNS? Here’s my take on it:","If you are a business: keep your page but don’t be reliant on it","There is a difference between a business who uses Facebook as an antennae to provide additional ways to stay in touch with customers and those whose business model is completely dependent on Facebook. We started our Facebook page when we were pulled into the Wikileaks Crisis as a way to stay in touch with our customers while that entire fiasco played out. We maintain it today for the same reason, and people do frequently contact us through that page looking for support.","You have to credit the guy with dominating his niche but I couldn’t help wondering what would happen to his business if something substantial changed at Facebook, or if some of his readers would feel “used” if they understood some of the myriad tactics some of these sites routinely use, via Facebook, to drive their own affiliate revenues.","It brings to mind 2 things:","My late friend and one of the original easyDNS customers Atul Chitnis who was among the first to observe “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product”","My own maxim, which I introduced in the Guerrilla Capitalism Overview that there are two kinds of companies, those that feed on customer ignorance compared to those who prosper via customer savvy . I think it is obvious to all, at least now, that Facebook needs customer ignorance to survive.","(Or as Zuck eloquently observed it back in his dormroom days)","YMMV on your personal pages","I read a long time ago “don’t put anything on the internet that you wouldn’t want to read in the newspapers the next day”, and that has served me well as a guide over the years.","My basic assumption is that everything I post to Facebook, including “private” messages are wide open, being harvested, data mined, aggregated, used to target and retarget ads to me, build a profile and otherwise compile a comprehensive dossier, even stuff I’ve “deleted”. (If you’ve ever watched “Terms and Conditions May Apply” you’ll know that Facebook actually keeps the stuff you “delete”).","So I never say anything on Facebook or put anything on there that is remotely confidential or proprietary. It’s strictly a water cooler. I like it because it enabled me to reconnect with various groups of my friends and peers over the years, from the kids I grew up and went to high school with in Galt, Ontario to the misfits from the London underground music scene in college, to the tech entrepreneurs from the mid-90’s on.","Would I use it to send anything to anybody that I found myself hoping that it’s never going to leak or be used against me? Uh, no. That would be terribly naive.","So to that end, I’ll probably keep my personal Facebook page, even though I sometimes catch myself spending too much time arguing stupid pointless crap (like politics) with people I’d otherwise never associate with. But that’s a self-discipline issue, not a data soveriengty issue (although it is now also common knowledge that Facebook deliberately codes the platform itself to be as addictive as possible)","All that said…","At least #deleteFacebook from your mobile devices","Facebook harvests your contact lists from your mobile devices (don’t believe me, go here)There are people in that list that I do not know.

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful U.S. watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident. The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap. As a result, the new probe carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant, which is facing similar investigations in Europe.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on two panels -- the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee – already have invited Zuckerberg to testify at two upcoming hearings. But lawmakers have not indicated if they would seek to subpoena the Facebook executive if he declined to attend or sought to send another company official in his place.","The Senate Judiciary Committee panel, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

Stamos reportedly clashed with top executives, including COO Sheryl Sandberg, over how the company should handle the situation.","According to The Times report, Stamos initially told the company he wanted to leave in December, after his day-to-day duties were reassigned. He was convinced to stay until August to help see through the transition of his responsibilities.","Stamos responded Monday to the report with a tweet that didn't explicitly address whether he intended to leave Facebook.","\"Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook,\" he tweeted. \"It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.\"","Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","A Facebook spokeswoman echoed Stamos' sentiment in a statement. \"Alex Stamos continues to be the Chief Security Officer (CSO) at Facebook,\" the statement said. \"He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.\"","The spokeswoman didn't directly address whether Stamos was planning to leave the company.","The news comes as Facebook deals with a controversy over Cambridge Analytica and its reported misuse of data from 50 million Facebook accounts.","Stamos made waves on Twitter this weekend when he criticized The New York Times and the Guardian for their portrayals of the way data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica used Facebook user data. The tweets said the situation, in which the firm accessed information from millions of Facebook accounts, wasn't a data breach or a leak. Then, he deleted those tweets.","Known for bursts of candidness on Twitter, Stamos has tweeted out his thoughts on a range of issues during his tenure at Facebook. In October, he let fly a string of tweets about the news media's coverage of artificial intelligence technology, which he said painted Silicon Valley unfairly as clueless.","\"Nobody of substance at the big companies thinks of algorithms as neutral,\" he wrote. \"Nobody is not aware of the risks.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

As MIT points out, that was categorized as \"basic information,\" which is most likely why so many people would grant permission.","'A chilling effect against free speech'","As of right now, there's no way to know for certain which information Cambridge Analytica had access to and eventually used. That's what various audits of Cambridge Analytica could reveal.","But the list of the types of data it could have taken includes 25 items.","The Guardian described Facebook's response to the breach of policy as \"downplayed.\" A Facebook spokeswoman named Christine Chen told the publication that the data was \"literally numbers\" and that there was \"no personally identifiable information included in this data.\"","Still, this much data in the hands of a third party could have far-reaching effects.","Fruchter, Specter, and Yuan summed it up best, saying that even though some of the data was public, what could be inferred from the full data set could be \"very sensitive.\"","\"If, for instance, this information were leaked, users' private data, such as political or religious affiliation, may quickly become public,\" they wrote. \"Such a disclosure could cause people to lose jobs and insurance, and also cause a chilling effect against free speech and association.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

This comes after news that the political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica used the 50 million users' data.","AILSA CHANG, HOST:","On this week's All Tech Considered, what are you doing about your Facebook account after the Cambridge Analytica revelations?","(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)","CHANG: After learning that the political firm Cambridge Analytica improperly got 50 million Facebook profiles, lots of people wrote in to NPR with their questions. Here's a sample of what we've heard.","JONI SHERMAN: My name is Joni Sherman (ph). I'm from Orlando, Fla. I'm wondering how in the heck this went on for so long without bells and whistles going on in their shop. And then I also wonder if I'm one of the 50 million Facebook users who's information was breached because I'd like to be able to react to that with my friends and such.","STEVE BEGAY: My name's Steve Begay (ph). I live in Rochester, N.Y. I'd like to know, from Facebook, where is my data. Who has taken it? Do they have an audit trail for what apps or other things have scraped my data?","GABRIELA SILK: My name is Gabriela Silk (ph). And I live in Longmont, Colo. Does Facebook even have the ability to tackle the enormity of this issue? And if they don't, what should I and other Facebook users be doing in the meantime?","CHANG: We're going to put some of those questions to Manoush Zomorodi now. She hosts WNYC's podcast Note To Self. She's been reporting on Cambridge Analytica and Facebook for a while now. And she's taking some steps to protect her own data. Manoush, welcome.","MANOUSH ZOMORODI, BYLINE: Hello, Ailsa.","CHANG: Currently, how do we know if, say, any of us are one of the 50 million people?","ZOMORODI: We don't yet. Mark Zuckerberg came out last week and said that Facebook will alert the 50 million people whose data were taken by Cambridge Analytica. But we haven't heard from him yet. But I think for now we should just all assume that our data has been taken...","CHANG: Yeah.","ZOMORODI: ...Because even if our data didn't go to Cambridge Analytica, who knows the other companies that may have had access to it?","CHANG: Is there a way for someone to find out all of the data that Facebook has on us?","ZOMORODI: Yes. On Facebook, if you go into settings, there is a way to download a copy of your information. It could include all the contacts in your address book, maybe your calendar. There are even some people saying that they have seen that it has metadata from cellphone calls that they made. That is because when you put Facebook on your phone, or you signed up for a new account, it said, would you like to connect with all your contacts? And if you said yes, it hasn't been made clear just how deeply it has gotten into your personal data. But you can download a zip file for yourself.","CHANG: So I heard that you went about trying to figure out what data Cambridge Analytica might have gotten on you.","ZOMORODI: Yeah, I was really curious. I was like, well, if there's a psychographic profile of me out there, I want to see it. I went to datarequest.cambridgeanalytica.org last year, and I put in a request. I had to give two forms of ID. I had to pay a 10-pound fee. And so I got back a file. It was not the 5,000 data points that Cambridge Analytica claims to have on the majority of U.S. voters. But it did have the GPS points of my home.","CHANG: Wow.","ZOMORODI: It had my voting history - days that I've gone to vote in elections. The point of all of this is though our personal data is floating around the world. We don't know who has it and where there have been no safeguards - particularly here in the U.S.","CHANG: OK. So Facebook says it is going to be rolling out new privacy settings. But does it actually have the ability to tackle this issue? I mean, does any social media site have the ability to protect your privacy?","ZOMORODI: Well, I think to protect our privacy, they have to change the very business models that they are built on. There's the old saying, which is if the product is free, then you are the product. In this case, why don't we have to pay for Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or any of those - because we are giving them so much data. And the data is how they are making so much money off of advertising.","So in order for us to really tackle this problem, these companies either have to be nonprofits, like the encryption-based texting service signal. Or we'd have to be willing to pay for them, which, of course, means that it would be only people who could afford to pay for closed social networks, which, of course, defeats the very purpose of these social networks. It's a crucial existential question for Silicon Valley, absolutely.","CHANG: Manoush Zomorodi is the host of WNYC's podcast Note To Self.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

And Facebook failed to protect its users' privacy and misrepresented how their data would be used, the lawsuit says.","\"(Facebook) sought to keep developers building on its platform and provide companies with all the tools they need to influence and manipulate user behavior,\" the suit complaint says. \"That's because Facebook is not a social media company; it is the largest data mining operation in existence.\"","The lawsuit joins others brought against the social media giant and Cambridge Analytica in response to a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London earlier this month. The newspapers reported that Cambridge Analytica, whose U.K.-based parent SCL Group was also named in Cook County's suit, gained access to private information of more than 50 million Facebook users, including their profiles, locations and what they like. The firm claimed its tools could analyze voters' personalities and influence their behavior with targeted messages.","Since the report, a public movement to delete Facebook has sprung up, and the privacy of people's online information has come into question. Some experts say that deleting a Facebook profile can't protect the decade's worth of data users have already poured into the platform.","The Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into Facebook, and U.K. investigators raided Cambridge Analytica's offices in London, according to reports.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised in a post last week that the company would do more to protect its users' data. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he wrote.","Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired the information, Facebook has said, but it didn't steal the data. Users allowed the maker of a personality quiz app to take the data. About 270,000 people took the quiz several years ago, and the app-maker was able to scrape data from their Facebook friends. He then provided the data to Cambridge Analytica.","Still, Facebook told its users that their personal data would be protected, according to the Cook County lawsuit.

How this petty, vengeful man might wield and expand the sprawling American spy apparatus, already vulnerable to abuse, is disturbing enough on its own. But the outlook is even worse considering Trump’s vast preference for private sector expertise and new strategic friendship with Silicon Valley billionaire investor Peter Thiel, whose controversial (and opaque) company Palantir has long sought to sell governments an unmatched power to sift and exploit information of any kind. Thiel represents a perfect nexus of government clout with the kind of corporate swagger Trump loves. The Intercept can now reveal that Palantir has worked for years to boost the global dragnet of the NSA and its international partners, and was in fact co-created with American spies.","Peter Thiel became one of the American political mainstream’s most notorious figures in 2016 (when it emerged he was bankrolling a lawsuit against Gawker Media, my former employer) even before he won a direct line to the White House.Now he brings to his role as presidential adviser decades of experience as kingly investor and token nonliberal on Facebook’s board of directors, a Rolodex of software luminaries, and a decidedly Trumpian devotion to controversy and contrarianism. But perhaps the most appealing asset Thiel can offer our bewildered new president will be Palantir Technologies, which Thiel founded with Alex Karp and Joe Lonsdale in 2004.","Palantir has never masked its ambitions, in particular the desire to sell its services to the U.S. government — the CIA itself was an early investor in the startup through In-Q-Tel, the agency’s venture capital branch. But Palantir refuses to discuss or even name its government clientele, despite landing “at least $1.2 billion” in federal contracts since 2009, according to an August 2016 report in Politico. The company was last valued at $20 billion and is expected to pursue an IPO in the near future. In a 2012 interview with TechCrunch, while boasting of ties to the intelligence community, Karp said nondisclosure contracts prevent him from speaking about Palantir’s government work.","“Palantir” is generally used interchangeably to refer to both Thiel and Karp’s company and the software that company creates. Its two main products are Palantir Gotham and Palantir Metropolis, more geeky winks from a company whose Tolkien namesake is a type of magical sphere used by the evil lord Sauron to surveil, trick, and threaten his enemies across Middle Earth. While Palantir Metropolis is pegged to quantitative analysis for Wall Street banks and hedge funds, Gotham (formerly Palantir Government) is designed for the needs of intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security customers. Gotham works by importing large reams of “structured” data (like spreadsheets) and “unstructured” data (like images) into one centralized database, where all of the information can be visualized and analyzed in one workspace. For example, a 2010 demo showed how Palantir Government could be used to chart the flow of weapons throughout the Middle East by importing disparate data sources like equipment lot numbers, manufacturer data, and the locations of Hezbollah training camps. Palantir’s chief appeal is that it’s not designed to do any single thing in particular, but is flexible and powerful enough to accommodate the requirements of any organization that needs to process large amounts of both personal and abstract data.","A Palantir promotional video.","Despite all the grandstanding about lucrative, shadowy government contracts, co-founder Karp does not shy away from taking a stand in the debate over government surveillance. In a Forbes profile in 2013, he played privacy lamb, saying, “I didn’t sign up for the government to know when I smoke a joint or have an affair. … We have to find places that we protect away from government so that we can all be the unique and interesting and, in my case, somewhat deviant people we’d like to be.” In that same article, Thiel lays out Palantir’s mission with privacy in mind: to “reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties.” After the first wave of revelations spurred by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, Palantir was quick to deny that it had any connection to the NSA spy program known as PRISM, which shared an unfortunate code name with one of its own software products. The current iteration of Palantir’s website includes an entire section dedicated to “Privacy & Civil Liberties,” proclaiming the company’s support of both:","Palantir Technologies is a mission-driven company, and a core component of that mission is protecting our fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties. …","Some argue that society must “balance” freedom and safety, and that in order to better protect ourselves from those who would do us harm, we have to give up some of our liberties. We believe that this is a false choice in many areas. Particularly in the world of data analysis, liberty does not have to be sacrificed to enhance security. Palantir is constantly looking for ways to protect privacy and individual liberty through its technology while enabling the powerful analysis necessary to generate the actionable intelligence that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies need to fulfill their missions.","It’s hard to square this purported commitment to privacy with proof, garnered from documents provided by Edward Snowden, that Palantir has helped expand and accelerate the NSA’s global spy network, which is jointly administered with allied foreign agencies around the world. Notably, the partnership has included building software specifically to facilitate, augment, and accelerate the use of XKEYSCORE, one of the most expansive and potentially intrusive tools in the NSA’s arsenal. According to Snowden documents published by The Guardian in 2013, XKEYSCORE is by the NSA’s own admission its “widest reaching” program, capturing “nearly everything a typical user does on the internet.” A subsequent report by The Intercept showed that XKEYSCORE’s “collected communications not only include emails, chats, and web-browsing traffic, but also pictures, documents, voice calls, webcam photos, web searches, advertising analytics traffic, social media traffic, botnet traffic, logged keystrokes, computer network exploitation targeting, intercepted username and password pairs, file uploads to online services, Skype sessions, and more.” For the NSA and its global partners, XKEYSCORE makes all of this as searchable as a hotel reservation site.","But how do you make so much data comprehensible for human spies? As the additional documents published with this article demonstrate, Palantir sold its services to make one of the most powerful surveillance systems ever devised even more powerful, bringing clarity and slick visuals to an ocean of surveillance data.","An office building occupied by the technology firm Palantir in McLean, Va., on Oct. 11, 2014.","Photo: Kristoffer Tripplaar/Sipa USA/AP","Palantir’s relationship with government spy agencies appears to date back to at least 2008, when representatives from the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters, joined their American peers at VisWeek, an annual data visualization and computing conference organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Attendees from throughout government and academia gather to network with members of the private sector at the event, where they compete in teams to solve hypothetical data-based puzzles as part of the Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge. As described in a document saved by GCHQ, Palantir fielded a team in 2008 and tackled one such scenario using its own software. It was a powerful marketing opportunity at a conference filled with potential buyers.","In the demo, Palantir engineers showed how their software could be used to identify Wikipedia users who belonged to a fictional radical religious sect and graph their social relationships. In Palantir’s pitch, its approach to the VAST Challenge involved using software to enable “many analysts working together [to] truly leverage their collective mind.” The fake scenario’s target, a cartoonishly sinister religious sect called “the Paraiso Movement,” was suspected of a terrorist bombing, but the unmentioned and obvious subtext of the experiment was the fact that such techniques could be applied to de-anonymize and track members of any political or ideological group. Among a litany of other conclusions, Palantir determined the group was prone to violence because its “Manifesto’s intellectual influences include ‘Pancho Villa, Che Guevara, Leon Trotsky, [and] Cuban revolutionary Jose Martí,’ a list of military commanders and revolutionaries with a history of violent actions.”","The delegation from GCHQ returned from VisWeek excited and impressed. In a classified report from those who attended, Palantir’s potential for aiding the spy agency was described in breathless terms. “Palantir are a relatively new Silicon Valley startup who are sponsored by the CIA,” the report began. “They claim to have significant involvement with the US intelligence community, although none yet at NSA.” GCHQ noted that Palantir “has been developed closely internally with intelligence community users (unspecified, but likely to be the CIA given the funding).” The report described Palantir’s demo as “so significant” that it warranted its own entry in GCHQ’s classified internal wiki, calling the software “extremely sophisticated and mature. … We were very impressed. You need to see it to believe it.”","The report conceded, however, that “it would take an enormous effort for an in-house developed GCHQ system to get to the same level of sophistication” as Palantir. The GCHQ briefers also expressed hesitation over the price tag, noting that “adoption would have [a] huge monetary … cost,” and over the implications of essentially outsourcing intelligence analysis software to the private sector, thus making the agency “utterly dependent on a commercial product.” Finally, the report added that “it is possible there may be concerns over security — the company have published a lot of information on their website about how their product is used in intelligence analysis, some of which we feel very uncomfortable about.”","A page from Palantir’s “Executive Summary” document, provided to government clients.","However anxious British intelligence was about Palantir’s self-promotion, the worry must not have lasted very long. Within two years, documents show that at least three members of the “Five Eyes” spy alliance between the United States, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada were employing Palantir to help gather and process data from around the world. Palantir excels at making connections between enormous, separate databases, pulling big buckets of information (call records, IP addresses, financial transactions, names, conversations, travel records) into one centralized heap and visualizing them coherently, thus solving one of the persistent problems of modern intelligence gathering: data overload.","Palantir is an information management platform for analysis developed by Palantir Technologies. It integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and collaborative features. The goal is to offer the infrastructure, or ‘full stack,’ that intelligence organizations require for analysis.","Bullet-pointed features of note included a “Graph View,” “Timelining capabilities,” and “Geo View.”","A GCHQ diagram indicates how Palantir could be used as part of a computer network attack.","Under the Five Eyes arrangement, member countries collect and pool enormous streams of data and metadata collected through tools like XKEYSCORE, amounting to tens of billions of records. The alliance is constantly devising (or attempting) new, experimental methods of prying data out of closed and private sources, including by hacking into computers and networks in non-Five Eyes countries and infecting them with malware.","A 2011 PowerPoint presentation from GCHQ’s Network Defence Intelligence & Security Team (NDIST) — which, as The Intercept has previously reported, “worked to subvert anti-virus and other security software in order to track users and infiltrate networks” — mentioned Palantir as a tool for processing data gathered in the course of its malware-oriented work. Palantir’s software was described as an “analyst workspace [for] pulling together disparate information and displaying it in novel ways,” and was used closely in conjunction with other intelligence software tools, like the NSA’s notorious XKEYSCORE search system. The novel ways of using Palantir for spying seemed open-ended, even imaginative: A 2010 presentation on the joint NSA-GCHQ “Mastering the Internet” surveillance program mentioned the prospect of running Palantir software on “Android handsets” as part of a SIGINT-based “augmented reality” experience. It’s unclear what exactly this means or could even look like.","Above all, these documents depict Palantir’s software as a sort of consolidating agent, allowing Five Eyes analysts to make sense of tremendous amounts of data that might have been otherwise unintelligible or highly time-consuming to digest. In a 2011 presentation to the NSA, classified top secret, an NDIST operative noted the “good collection” of personal data among the Five Eyes alliance but lamented the “poor analytics,” and described the attempt to find new tools for SIGINT analysis, in which it “conducted a review of 14 different systems that might work.” The review considered services from Lockheed Martin and Detica (a subsidiary of BAE Systems) but decided on the up-and-comer from Palo Alto.","Palantir is described as having been funded not only by In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital branch, but furthermore created “through [an] iterative collaboration between Palantir computer scientists and analysts from various intelligence agencies over the course of nearly three years.” While it’s long been known that Palantir got on its feet with the intelligence community’s money, it has not been previously reported that the intelligence community actually helped build the software. The continuous praise seen in these documents shows that the collaboration paid off. Under the new “Palantir Model,” “data can come from anywhere” and can be “asked whatever the analyst wants.”","Along with Palantir’s ability to pull in “direct XKS Results,” the presentation boasted that the software was already connected to 10 other secret Five Eyes and GCHQ programs and was highly popular among analysts. It even offered testimonials (TWO FACE appears to be a code name for the implementation of Palantir):","[Palantir] is the best tool I have ever worked with. It’s intuitive, i.e. idiot-proof, and can do a lot you never even dreamt of doing.","This morning, using TWO FACE rather than XKS to review the activity of the last 3 days. It reduced the initial analysis time by at least 50%.","Enthusiasm runs throughout the PowerPoint: A slide titled “Unexpected Benefits” reads like a marketing brochure, exclaiming that Palantir “interacts with anything!” including Google Earth, and “You can even use it on a iphone or laptop.” The next slide, on “Potential Downsides,” is really more praise in disguise: Palantir “Looks expensive” but “isn’t as expensive as expected.” The answer to “What can’t it do?” is revealing: “However we ask, Palantir answer,” indicating that the collaboration between spies and startup didn’t end with Palantir’s CIA-funded origins, but that the company was willing to create new features for the intelligence community by request.","On GCHQ’s internal wiki page for TWO FACE, analysts were offered a “how to” guide for incorporating Palantir into their daily routine, covering introductory topics like “How do I … Get Data from XKS in Palantir,” “How do I … Run a bulk search,” and “How do I … Run bulk operations over my objects in Palantir.”For anyone in need of a hand, “training is currently offered as 1-2-1 desk based training with a Palantir trainer. This gives you the opportunity to quickly apply Palantir to your current work task.” Palantir often sends “forward deployed engineers,” or FDEs, to work alongside clients at their offices and provide assistance and engineering services, though the typical client does not have access to the world’s largest troves of personal information. For analysts interested in tinkering with Palantir, there was even a dedicated instant message chat room open to anyone for “informally” discussing the software.","The GCHQ wiki includes links to classified webpages describing Palantir’s use by the Australian Defence Signals Directorate (now called the Australian Signals Directorate) and to a Palantir entry on the NSA’s internal “Intellipedia,” though The Intercept does not have access to copies of the linked sites. However, embedded within Intellipedia HTML files available to The Intercept are references to a variety of NSA-Palantir programs, including “Palantir Classification Helper,” “[Target Knowledge Base] to Palantir PXML,” and “PalantirAuthService.” (Internal Palantir documents obtainedby TechCrunch in 2013 provide additional confirmation of the NSA’s relationship with the company.)","One Palantir program used by GCHQ, a software plug-in named “Kite,” was preserved almost in its entirety among documents provided to The Intercept. An analysis of Kite’s source code shows just how much flexibility the company afforded Five Eyes spies. Developers and analysts could ingest data locally using either Palantir’s “Workspace” application or Kite. When they were satisfied the process was working properly, they could push it into a Palantir data repository where other Workspace users could also access it, almost akin to a Google Spreadsheets collaboration. When analysts were at their Palantir workstation, they could perform simple imports of static data, but when they wanted to perform more complicated tasks like import databases or set up recurring automatic imports, they turned to Kite.","Kite worked by importing intelligence data and converting it into an XML file that could be loaded into a Palantir data repository. Out of the box, Kite was able to handle a variety of types of data (including dates, images, geolocations, etc.), but GCHQ was free to extend it by writing custom fields for complicated types of data the agency might need to analyze. The import tools were designed to handle a variety of use cases, including static data sets, databases that were updated frequently, and data stores controlled by third parties to which GCHQ was able to gain access.","This collaborative environment also produced a piece of software called “XKEYSCORE Helper,” a tool programmed with Palantir (and thoroughly stamped with its logo) that allowed analysts to essentially import data from the NSA’s pipeline, investigate and visualize it through Palantir, and then presumably pass it to fellow analysts or Five Eyes intelligence partners. One of XKEYSCORE’s only apparent failings is that it’s so incredibly powerful, so effective at vacuuming personal metadata from the entire internet, that the volume of information it extracts can be overwhelming. Imagine trying to search your Gmail account, only the results are pulled from every Gmail inbox in the world.","Making XKEYSCORE more intelligible — and thus much more effective — appears to have been one of Palantir’s chief successes. The helper tool, documented in a GCHQ PDF guide, provided a means of transferring data captured by the NSA’s XKEYSCORE directly into Palantir, where presumably it would be far easier to analyze for, say, specific people and places. An analyst using XKEYSCORE could pull every IP address in Moscow and Tehran that visited a given website or made a Skype call at 14:15 Eastern Time, for example, and then import the resulting data setinto Palantir in order to identify additional connections between the addresses or plot their positions using Google Earth.","Palantir was also used as part of a GCHQ project code-named LOVELY HORSE, which sought to improve the agency’s ability to collect so-called open source intelligence — data available on the public internet, like tweets, blog posts, and news articles. Given the “unstructured” nature of this kind of data, Palantir was cited as “an enrichment to existing [LOVELY HORSE] investigations … the content should then be viewable in a human readable format within Palantir.”","Palantir’s impressive data-mining abilities are well-documented, but so too is the potential for misuse. Palantir software is designed to make it easy to sift through piles of information that would be completely inscrutable to a human alone, but the human driving the computer is still responsible for making judgments, good or bad.","A 2011 document by GCHQ’s SIGINT Development Steering Group, a staff committee dedicated to implementing new spy methods, listed some of these worries. In a table listing “risks & challenges,” the SDSG expressed a “concern that [Palantir] gives the analyst greater potential for going down too many analytical paths which could distract from the intelligence requirement.” What it could mean for analysts to distract themselves by going down extraneous “paths” while browsing the world’s most advanced spy machine is left unsaid. But Palantir’s data-mining abilities were such that the SDSG wondered if its spies should be blocked from having full access right off the bat and suggested configuring Palantir software so that parts would “unlock … based on analysts skill level, hiding buttons and features until needed and capable of utilising.” If Palantir succeeded in fixing the intelligence problem of being overwhelmed with data, it may have created a problem of over-analysis — the company’s software offers such a multitude of ways to visualize and explore massive data sets that analysts could get lost in the funhouse of infographics, rather than simply being overwhelmed by the scale of their task.","If Palantir’s potential for misuse occurred to the company’s spy clients, surely it must have occurred to Palantir itself, especially given the company’s aforementioned “commitment” to privacy and civil liberties. Sure enough, in 2012 the company announced the formation of the Palantir Council of Advisors on Privacy and Civil Liberties, a committee of academics and consultants with expertise in those fields. Palantir claimed that convening the PCAP had “provided us with invaluable guidance as we try to responsibly navigate the often ill-defined legal, political, technological, and ethical frameworks that sometimes govern the various activities of our customers,” and continued to discuss the privacy and civil liberties “implications of product developments and to suggest potential ways to mitigate any negative effects.” Still, Palantir made clear that the “PCAP is advisory only — any decisions that we make after consulting with the PCAP are entirely our own.”","What would a privacy-minded conversation about privacy-breaching software look like? How had a privacy and civil liberties council navigated the fact that Palantir’s clientele had directly engaged in one of the greatest privacy and civil liberties breaches of all time? It’s hard to find an answer.","Palantir wrote thatit structured the nondisclosure agreement signed by PCAP members so that they “will be free to discuss anything that they learn in working with us unless we clearly designate information as proprietary or otherwise confidential (something that we have rarely found necessary except on very limited occasions).” But despite this assurance of transparency, all but one of the PCAP’s former and current members either did not return a request for comment for this article or declined to comment citing the NDA.","The former PCAP member who did respond, Stanford privacy scholar Omer Tene, told The Intercept that he was unaware of “any specific relationship, agreement, or project that you’re referring to,” and said he was not permitted to answer whether Palantir’s work with the intelligence community was ever a source of tension with the PCAP. He declined to comment on either the NSA or GCHQ specifically. “In general,” Tene said, “the role of the PCAP was to hear about client engagement or new products and offerings that the company was about to launch, and to opine as to the way they should be set up or delivered in order to minimize privacy and civil liberties concerns.” But without any further detail, it’s unclear whether the PCAP was ever briefed on the company’s work for spy agencies, or whether such work was a matter of debate.","There’s little detail to be found on archived versions of Palantir’s privacy and civil liberties-focused blog, which appears to have been deleted sometime after the PCAP was formed. Palantir spokesperson Matt Long told The Intercept to contact the Palantir media team for questions regarding the vanished blog at the same email address used to reach Long in the first place. Palantir did not respond to additional repeated requests for comment and clarification.","A GCHQ spokesperson provided a boilerplate statement reiterating the agency’s “longstanding policy” against commenting on intelligence matters and asserted that all its activities are “carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework.” The NSA did not provide a response.","Anyone worried that the most powerful spy agencies on Earth might use Palantir software to violate the privacy or civil rights of the vast number of people under constant surveillance may derive some cold comfort in a portion of the user agreement language Palantir provided for the Kite plug-in, which stipulates that the user will not violate “any applicable law” or the privacy or the rights “of any third party.” The world will just have to hope Palantir’s most powerful customers follow the rules."],"isopubdate":""}

This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.","The plan centers on third-party brokers like Acxiom Corp. and Epsilon Data Management LLC, both of which collect information to package and sell — sometimes to other brokers, other times to marketers who intend to use the insights on platforms like Facebook’s.","Data brokers have been around a while, each collecting information that dates back before the internet was commonly used in most US households. Back then they collected information on your magazine and newspaper subscriptions, whether you owned a home, and how you were likely to vote. Today they know your sexual preferences, what you watch on TV, who your closest friends and family members are, and even whether you prefer a coupe or a sedan. It’s fair to say the internet has upped the ante.","Major players often purchased this bundled data, using that to help segment specific audiences to advertise to on social networks — in this case Facebook. Mudd is correct in saying that it’s common industry practice. Facebook though, provides targeting options that allow marketers to create laser-focused campaigns using the insights, a powerful combination that hadn’t existed just a decade prior — or, even on the same scale five years ago.","Today’s move to shut the door on these companies is a big one for Facebook, a company burdened by the weight of yet another privacy scandal. There’s still work to do, but even I — a self-professed Facebook cynic — commend the company for taking a proactive move rather than its typical reactionary backpedaling after major missteps."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information.

After in-depth research into the business models, here is what I found…","A quick explanation","For those new to the space, blockchains are immutable (unchangeable), often trustless ledgers — creating digital scarcity and the possibly for much more. Due to their decentralized nature (run by a community vs a single entity) and their economic incentive models (tokens), they potentially represent a major threat to the status quo — at least that is what enthusiasts would have us believe (more on this later in article).","Basically this means that anything that was once done/stored on paper can now be accomplished and recorded on the blockchain, creating an infinite and unchangeable “paper” trail of ownership records, programmable contracts, financial information, personal data and much more.","And at least in theory, it would be owned by the users — something unheard of today.","The GAFA tech gods","As we enter 2018, we are entering into an era of unparalleled tech dominance. Companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple control more and more of our everyday lives — owning our data and everything around it. The inherent network effects and flywheels these companies built are unprecedented — both in their scope and ability to stave off competition.","In this connected world where things are constantly changing, I thought it could be beneficial to analyze/theorize blockchain based competitors to combat the tech giants of today — specifically to focus on what it would take to win.","Google","(For a in-depth analysis of Google’s core business model, strengths and weaknesses, future focuses and potential acquisitions, see this post)","Google is one of the most complicated companies today, with dozens of divisions and products that dominate our daily life.","We will skip most of these areas and instead focus on their primary business model — advertising.","1. Google Search","Google is the dominant search engine with over 77% of global searches going through Google (Source: NetMarketShare.com).","Despite the fact that 1.3B people (there are only 7.6B people globally) live behind China’s Firewall, Google still owns over ¾ of the search engine market. This dominance has fueled Google’s historic rise.","2. Youtube","Youtube is the second largest search engine in the world, and easily the largest user generated video platform. Users upload an impossible 100 hours of content to Youtube every minute.","And Credit Suisse believes that in 2015, Youtube and Google Play accounted for ~15% of Google’s revenue (up from 4% in 2010), and forecasted to reach 24% by 2020.","Considering Google only paid $1.65B to acquire them in 2006, that is one hell of a deal.","3. AdSense — display advertising","The other piece of Google’s advertising supremacy is their partner network, AdSense. AdSense allows sites to monetize through Google’s advertising platform without worrying about the backend or finding advertisers. Instead Google handles everything and takes a between 32 and 49 percent of ad revenue generate (the rest going to publishers).","According to Investopedia, AdSense revenues accounted for $15.5B, ie 23% of Google’s total revenue in 2016.","Unfortunately advertising as a business focuses on eyeballs over quality, leading to much of the degradation and click baity titles of today. I don’t see the advertising model changing drastically anytime soon, meaning Google’s great success with AdSense is likely to continue (and grow).","How blockchain beats Google","Google’s business is all about eyeballs, attention and “supposed transparency.”","Their slogan of “don’t be evil” and mission to openly share information with the world are notably at odds.","This creates a scenario where Google’s platform is god and only those that play by his/her rules are allowed in the garden of Google.","But, crypto complicates things for Google.","Google’s dominance is primarily driven by the network effects of big data and AI combined with force of habit — a near perfect storm.","At the same time however, many in the tech community are worried about the role tech giants play in our lives, especially as it relates to selling our personal data.","And as we have seen, the tech community is taking some shots from politicians and users over their role in the recent US election.","1. Search","A blockchain based browser/search engine could solve the problem of misaligned incentives. I have started using DuckDuckGo (a privacy focused search engine) after my research for the book (The Big Four — How Today’s Tech Companies Monopolize the Future) revealed the extent of Google’s power and control over my life.","DDG’s approach has major advantages for users, namely disintermediating value with personal data — but there are issues as well.","The reason Google is dominates is their data and AI expertise. They know us better than we know ourselves and are able to deliver better experiences as a result. It is the reason Antitrust action will almost never occur in the US — our definition of monopoly is based upon consumer price gouging and poor experiences — the opposite of what today’s top tech companies deliver.","You want the best results for you, and you want them now. Google delivers this.","A blockchain based search engine (BBSE) could theoretically win here. Combined with an identity coin like Citizen, a BBSE could use consumer data and preferences (without ever owning/controlling them) to display better, more personalized search results for users.","And if advertising was added, BBSE users would benefit as well, earning tokenized “commissions” in exchange for seeing the ads — removing the adversarial relationship that exists today.","Unfortunately I foresee this as being a long ways off. To change user behavior, you need a 5–10x better solut than the existing product. To get to the point where a BBSE which surpasses Google’s market share (currently 77–80%) will take years.","Most people too freely give up their data and information without reading the terms of service (myself included).","2. Video","Competing with Youtube presents many of the same challenges as tackling search. There is one major advantage however, the creators create the platform and value.","And because Youtube advertising isn’t effective for the vast majority of creators, this could be interesting.","“According to our analysis, the average CPM that can be expected from YouTube videos is between $0.50 and $5.00. That means that for every 1 million views of your videos, you can expect to make between $500 and $5,000.” — Monetize Pros","Because Youtube is so competitive and the ability to earn is limited, it makes logical sense that creators would cross-populate content. On a new blockchain based video platform (BBVP), there would be less competition and thus a greater percentage of attention.","If incentives were added for creators to create content and onboard audiences, the rewards suddenly get more interesting. The first mover advantages create inherent network effects and time urgency — bring over your subscribers before some other Youtuber does.","That said it would still take time, especially to bring sufficient eyeballs to make good money. But with strong enough token incentives and quality content, it seems safe to say that news would spread.","The question is how fast. Odds are a BBVP would take several years to mature. Youtube has over 100 hours of video uploaded every minute — that is a lot of evergreen, SEO rich content.","And because Google favors Youtube, it would be hard to steal search traffic.","NOTE: Steemit/Dtube is currently working on building a Youtube killer but has a long long way to go to create a credible threat. That said Steemit is one of the most active blockchain projects/cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $1.49B and processes over 1M transactions per day (820k/day as of July 2017) — things are happening!","3. Adsense","Advertising ruined the internet, and journalism. When the world switched from subscriptions to display ads, quality started to slide.","Today clickbait is king. More eyeballs and pageviews (hence those annoying freaking slideshows) has created a world where artificial attention is rewarded. We have seen the quality of journalism and content degrade — prioritizing provocative headlines, flashy thumbnails and accidentally promoting an asshole like Trump.","NOTE:Trump won because he created controversy, driving eyeballs (ie ad dollars) and thus rankings/ratings around the globe. Our disgust forced us to read and forced his image and message everywhere like an unescapable evil billboard.","A blockchain based publication model (BBPM) could in theory solve this. Medium does a decent job of illustrating the point (although not profitably), by allowing users to upvote/Clap for articles they enjoy (up to 50 Claps). A similar model could redistribute dollars to the sites and publications we appreciate most.","And there are companies/organizations trying to do just that, both with and without blockchains. This is a hard proposition though because the majority don’t understand the power/risk of personal information.","Most people are fine with “being the product” and profiting (receivingfree content/access) for their contribution to the system.","In my opinion the one and only way a blockchain based answer to Adsense could succeed would be tokenized incentives for early adopters (users and publishers) to the system where Adsense ads had an if/then statement attached. If user is BBPM member, no ads. If not then display ads.","In order to participate in the BBPM, publishers could jointly collude to “monopolize” the market, creating a linearly sliding scale of advertising intrusiveness across all web properties to encourage laggards to convert (ie overtime sites across the internet become less and less usable and more and more ads/spammy until readers joined the BBPM)","That said, I don’t see a “mafia-like” approach like this being adopted or believe change can happen in under a generation (hard to go from free to paid and be okay with it).","Hopefully I kids help kill clickbait…","Amazon","The company Bezos built to sell books online is now arguably the most dominant and diversified company on earth, and the odds on favorite to crack the $1T market cap first.","This seems to be the consensus, at least among technologists. But the majority are often very wrong, so let’s dive deeper (see the article below for a more in-depth analysis of Amazon’s future).","Understanding the empire","Amazon’s business is made up of five primary divisions: Amazon.com, AWS, Alexa, Whole Foods Market and Amazon Prime.","Each on its own would be an impressive business. Combined they create the world’s largest flywheel.","I don’t believe Alexa, Whole Foods or Amazon Prime have any risk of blockchain based disruption (at least in the foreseeable future). The nature of these business models isn’t easily decentralized.","And while decentralized AI/compute could be an interesting component to building an Alexa killer, I believe the bulk of the effort to be merging multiple technologies and disciplines (voice, AI, APIs, hardware) which seem highly unlikely in the foreseeable future","1. Amazon.com","Amazon’s is the most monopolistic and well positioned marketplace the Western world has ever seen. Last year they did $136B in revenue with double digit growth every year.","2017 estimates show a staggering 44% of US ecommerce occurred on Amazon.com (Source: Recode). And Amazon has been growing at least 13% YoY (year-over-year) for each of the last 5 years. It isn’t just a monopoly, it is accelerating.","But there is another layer to unpack — Amazon Basics, where Amazon analyzes 3rd party seller data and copies the best performing products.","Ultimately Amazon wants to replace ALL 3rd party sellers/products with Amazon Basics versions. Amazon wants to (and will) own the customer, and every ounce of margin that comes with it.","Today ~42% of the web is powered by AWS. That is more than double Microsoft, Google and IBM (combined). Yet given the easy to use system and affordable pricing, it makes sense.","And growth isn’t slowing, quite the opposite actually. AWS accounts for 10% of Amazon’s overall revenue, with $4.6B in Q3 of 2017 (up 42% over last year) and $1.2B in profit (up 36% over last year).","Source: GeekWire","Amazon owns the infrastructure the majority of the internet is built on, can decentralization change that?","How blockchain beats Amazon","I have my money on Amazon. They are the best positioned of the tech giants to own the future.","That said, blockchain can create challenges for Bezos’ beast, it depends how it is implemented, incentivized and evolves.","1. Ecommerce","While Amazon owns ecommerce today, there are many projects focused on building decentralized marketplaces.","Most miss the point though. The issue isn’t Amazon’s ~15%+ transaction fee, that is par for the course and the cost of doing business. And besides, consumers could care less how much sellers pay in fees, it doesn’t affect them.","(Plus 10% is a fraction of the 5–10x improvement needed to switch — it wouldn’t be meaningful enough for sellers to abandon Amazon entirely).","Yes, sellers care about fees, but what is more important is control. As referenced previously, Amazon sellers (like myself previously — more on my backstory here) play on Amazon’s playground.","You never knew if/when you will be uninvited — or Amazon could copy your product (Amazon Basics) and cut you out.","This creates a constant fear of suspension. If 80%+ of your business is on Amazon, what happens if you lose access?","A decentralized marketplace NEEDS to be built first and foremost by sellers. That is doable in my opinion.","Most sellers would do ANYTHING to control their company’s destiny. If that means promoting a blockchain based ecommerce platform (BBEP), you can bet your ass they would — even without tokenized incentives. Adding incentives further accelerates adoption among sellers.","But buyers is another story. Here tokenized “discounts” or “bonuses” could be used to lure buyers to the platform.","The challenge is that most sellers cannot easily access their customer base on Amazon. And to contact them and try to bring them off-Amazon can result in suspension.","Plus sellers wouldn’t want to send their own customers (ie from their standalone site or email list) to an unproven, competitive marketplace, unless it was as an affiliate for other products.","Here an Amazon Affiliates type program would be necessary (ie: I sell X and recommend Y related products to past customers on the BBEP, earning tokens for each signup/sale).","This could also be employed for heavily incentivized buyer-to-buyer and publisher-to-buyer referral programs to get customers “in-the-door.” If sufficient supply and trust was built, the platform would start to take off, with crypto-economics driving adoption. If the user experience is inferior however, this would take a lot of time.","Plus consider the options. If Amazon has 100x the product selection, why would consumers use a BBEP? You need better prices or a huge token incentivizes initially — or today’s massive “speculative-esque” belief in the business and team to drive token appreciation.","2. File storage & web services","To be honest, decentralized file storage seems like overkill for many applications. With dirt cheap cheap AWS/S3 file storage, you need a compelling case to justify relatively unproven blockchain based web services (BBWS).","Currently the only use case that seems valuable is decentralized file storage for other decentralized apps and protocols. When full decentralization is necessary (or wanted), it makes sense to use a service like Sia or Storj.","But even then, it will take time to scale the eco-system, ie primary customer base. Without enough dApp traction, who will blockchain based storage systems (BBSS) serve? This creates a bit of a chicken-egg scenario…","Storj claims a fully decentralized storage system where users are able to buy/rent harddrive space autonomously will make that storages cost 10–100x cheaper than centralized solutions.","I am a bit skeptical. To store 1T of data on Storj today costs $15/mo plus additional bandwidth fees (for downloads). Google Drive is a flat $10 for that same Terrabyte (plus comes with all the additional functionality of Google Docs etc…)","Compared to AWS S3, Storj does better. While AWS/S3 is $0.023/GB/mo, Storj is only $0.015/GB/mo. But that is only a 34% improvement, well shy of the 5–10x improvement typically needed to switch products/service providers.","That said, some of the top VCs like Union Square Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Andressen Horowitz all invested in Filecoin so maybe I am totally wrong here.","A BBSS is the simplest blockchain model to understand. Users are easily incentivized to provide storage space and customers/enterprises can save a little money on storage.","But usually when an opportunity is obvious, it isn’t a great opportunity and becomes pretty competitive, so only time will tell…","Facebook","As of June 2017, Facebook hit an unprecedented 2B MAUs (monthly active users). That is nearly ⅓ of the population.","While there are several divisions within Facebook (thanks to a few successful acquisitions), Facebook is at its core a social media and communications company. We will focus on Facebook.com, Instagram and Whatsapp/Facebook Messenger as these are their three primary businesses and those most ripe for blockchain disruption.","(For a deeper dive into Facebook and the future of the company, see this longform breakdown and analysis)","1. Facebook.com","Facebook has over 2B monthly active users — yet despite the massive market penetration, they are still growing 16% year-over-year. How is that possible?","Source: TechCrunch","This is due in large part to the brilliant leadership of Mark Zuckerberg where Facebook bet the farm on mobile — it worked. They were able to go from ~135M MAUs (mobile only) in early-mid 2012 to over 1.15B in Q4 of 2016.","The lionshare of growth has been mobile advertising — with mobile now accounting for 86% of their revenue — better than ANYONE expected.","Today digital advertising is a duopoly, with Google and Facebook attracting between 57–84% of global digital (outside of China) depending on source.(Source — FT.com, Recode).","Scarier still is the fact that the duopoly is taking >99% of new growth is digital ad spend (as of Q3 2016).","Source: Fortune","2. Instagram","Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 for a $1B for a pre-revenue company with 30M users (formed only 2 years prior).","After waiting 3 years to monetize (to focus on growth), Instagram turned on ads and became a cash cow.","And with 100M new MAUs every 6 months, Instagram is exploding in popularity. Copying Snapchat Stories certainly helped (which Zuck was 100% happy to rip — pixel by pixel).","NOTE:Snap’s stock has dropped 50% since the ill timed (controversial and greedy) IPO.","Plus Instagram addresses a different market (millennials) and use case than the Facebook— building their advertising base even larger.","Source: eMarketer","3. Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger","NOTE: I refuse to consider Facebook messenger a messaging app as it is just the messaging feature of Facebook — thus messages from Facebook come through and grossly distort the usage numbers. Either way Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger are the two largest “messaging apps” worldwide.","Facebook bought Whatsapp in February of 2014 for a whopping $19B, which again seemed absurd.","But Facebook’s business has ALWAYS been built around attention, eyeballs and waiting to monetize. And if Instagram is any indication, they know what they are doing.","Stern Agee, the financial services company estimates Whatsapp could be generating close to $5B in revenue with over 2.3B users by 2023. I would go bigger.","Due to Whatsapp’s more private, intimate nature, it creates growth opportunities that an outward facing site like Facebook and to some extent Instagram cannot match. Essentially even if/as people become more reserved about social media, sharing and controlling their data, Whatsapp can still win — rigging the game in Facebook’s favor.","How blockchain beats Facebook","Of all the Big Four, blockchain poses the largest threat to Facebook. Facebook’s business is built upon attention, advertising and collecting user data.","A network out of Harvard originally built for college hookups is now worth $524B — and users never saw a dime. They see quite a few ads though.","1. Facebook.com","A decentralized version of Facebook seems obvious at this point. In a social ecosystem without a centralized party, algorithms can be optimized for user happiness, rather than engagement.","The biggest problem with Facebook (and Google) is that they are advertising based businesses. Facebook makes their money on impressions, making it more and more user hostile over time to drive ad revenues.","From a purely economic standpoint, this means Zuck wants users on Facebook as close to 24 hrs a day as humanly possible. Obviously this isn’t sustainable, and studies show social media usage (especially Facebook) have a net negative impacts on happiness. In the long term this is not sustainable for Facebook — the more you use Facebook, the worse you feel.","Russian election hacking and Jew hate based targeting aside, Facebook could have a serious problem on its hands if more and more users start to churn — which appears to be the case.","Why else would Facebook be actively trying to reduce user addiction?","Enter a blockchain based competitor…","The token incentive structure should be pretty straightforward. Like Airbnb’s refer a friend and you both get $10 credit, a blockchain based social network (BBSN) could rewards users with BBSN tokens for referrals, creating popular content, posting daily etc…","Tokens could represent virtual economies in the network (buying/selling stickers, access to certain bonuses, or even upvote/downvote micro payments) or they could be positioned as advertising prerequisites, where users could “sell” their attention or engagement to advertisers.","It seems highly likely a BBSN will pop up to compete with Facebook. The question is, will tokenized incentives be enough to overcome Facebook’s enormous network effect? I believe yes, but think it will take at least ½ a generation.","2. Instagram","Same as above, plus with the added bonus of influencers. Because Instagram is more focused on one-to-many communication, users that build followings could sell access tokens to advertisers looking to promote products in a more transparent and simple fashion.","Although outside of the target market here, I would give a blockchain based social photo site (BBSPS) a decent chance at gaining significant traction","3. Whatsapp","The odds of a blockchain based messaging app (BBMA) taking off are pretty slim. There are so many messaging apps, why build a blockchain based one? Most messaging apps are encrypted anyways so the trust and security level is relatively high.","The big challenge however is scale. As of July 2017, there were over 55B Whatsapp messages sent every day (Source — AndroidPolice).","Crypto kitties crashed Ethereum’s network, and that was only a few hundred thousand “transactions”.","But cryptocurrencies built on a centralized service is a different story.","The popular messaging app Kik just completed a successful ICO, raising $98M to build a “KIN” currency into their app. With 300M users as of May 2016, it is no surprise that Kik had to quickly switch off ethereum’s net to handle their volume.","Rumors are circulating that Facebook may be looking to (or starting to) implement Litecoin for p2p payments. This would be a landmark moment not just for Facebook but for cryptocurrency — bringing decentralized, non-governmental payments to the masses.","If this is the case, Facebook could set itself up as the dominant p2p payment system. Here is why.","The banking and financial services infrastructure is old, outdated and expensive. Even newer, leaner companies like Paypal charge $0.30 + 2.9% on every transaction they process. And Venmo is in the process of starting to charge as well.","And while these may seem tiny, especially compared to traditional banking, cryptocurrencies unlock a totally new dimension of money — one that approach 0% fees with no middlemen or hoops to jump through.","As we have seen, the peer-to-peer payments market is exploding, forecasted to reach $86B in 2018 in the US alone. And with global mobile payments expected to exceed $930B, this opportunity dwarfs the digital advertising space.","If Facebook goes big on implementing either an established cryptocurrency or creating FBcoin, they could own the messaging and p2p payments spaces.","Apple","Apple is the most valuable company and arguably the most beloved brand worldwide.","It is also a money printing machine to the tune of $215B in 2016. And that was a down year…","And up until recently, consumers were also lied to concerning the “upgradeability” of iPhone parts. No one knew iPhone batteries were interchangeable…","I cannot see a company so focused on secrecy adapting well to blockchain based applications and transparency. That said, Apple has better security than their Android counterparts which will be increasingly important as consumers store cryptographic assets directly on their mobile devices.","If Apple adapts, this could be a big win. If not, it could accelerate their undoing — especially because ALMOST everything depends on the iPhone ecosystem.","Closing thoughts","Blockchain technology is creating an interesting and ever changing world. While we have seen hundreds of ICOs promising everything under the sun, little has actually been accomplished or implemented to date. And though I am bullish on blockchain in the long run, I believe we are headed for a coming crypto winter where teams build, markets (and market caps) crash and only the strong survive.","Thinning the herd will benefit the community, forging stronger teams and bonds among blockchain devs and the ecosystem at large.","The big questions to be answered are timeline and scale. Crypto enthusiasts claim Bitcoin and blockchain are the best thing since sliced bread, but actions speak louder than words.","What are your thoughts? Which tech companies are you betting on and where do you see dApps, tokenization and blockchain based tech taking over the world?","Would love to hear predictions and educated guesses in the comments section below.","Which areas of the economy will be most impacted in the coming 5 years? 10 years?","Before you go…","If you got something actionable or valuable from this post, click 👏 button below or share the article on Facebook and Twitter so your friends can benefit from it too.","Hold down the clap button if you liked the content!

This is in direct contrast to Apple, which takes a far more conservative approach to user privacy.","The difference between the two tech giants should be a guide to all tech companies as they grapple with the rising chorus of demands for better measures to protect user privacy and user data.","The scraping of years of call histories is only the latest problem with user privacy to emerge at Facebook, coming quickly on the heels of revelations that the massive social network allowed a dodgy political consulting company, Cambridge Analytica, to scrape tens of millions of users’ information after they installed an app that stated it was to be used for academic research.","Let’s contrast Facebook’s approach to that of Apple. Apple takes user privacy seriously, and has been willing to fight for it. Witness the court battle Apple mounted against the FBI to prevent the government from forcing it to install backdoors that would allow investigators to circumvent encryption.","Apple emphasized user privacy long before its rivals did. The company built end-to-end encryption into iMessage and FaceTime from their inception. Apple also makes it exceptionally easy to encrypt your entire hard drive; in fact, this is a core feature of the Mac laptop operating system. And Apple Pay is designed in way that really enhances privacy—by not storing actual credit card information on users’ phones or computers and instead using one-way encryption for payments.","Equally important, Apple has invested heavily in building data mining tools that respect user privacy and attempt to anonymize and obfuscate user data in mathematically defensible ways. Called “differential privacy,” the technique injects noise into user profiles and activities to mask identities while gathering anonymized data into larger groups that are useful to Apple but difficult to trace back to individual users.","Apple is the only major tech company to take such a step. Even though some critics argue that differential privacy may not provide as much protection as Apple claims, they still laud Apple for trying to implement a better vision for user data and user privacy—something that Facebook has yet to clearly articulate beyond intoning that user privacy matters.","It’s important to note that Apple makes money by selling products and services to users and relies to a much lesser degree than Facebook does on advertising money. Apple’s direct link to customers has likely given the company a far stronger internal compass to design products with its users’ best interests in mind.","An option box to disable the Facebook app displayed on the screen of a mobile phone. Facebook is under fire for the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal.","Yui Mok/PA Images via Getty Images","But that’s no reason to cut Facebook much slack. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the company’s other leaders make the same broad statements as Apple does about putting users’ privacy and needs first. Yet revelation after revelation indicate otherwise.","Yes, Facebook has a data policy. Every tech company does. But the proof is in the product decisions, and that’s where it’s clear that Facebook preaches one thing in data and builds another. In contrast, Apple practices to a much greater degree what it preaches.","This fundamental distinction may be the difference between life and death for Facebook. Social networks all have implicit contracts with their users: They must feel safe inside the network. And, more importantly, a rapid loss of users on a social network can translate to its rapid demise. Just ask the folks who built Friendster and MySpace about that.","Facebook may face this same fate unless it can quickly correct its privacy issues, not only with statements, but also with a change in how it builds its products and executes its business decisions."],"isopubdate":""}

From there, you will be able to select and edit every app which has permission to use your information. “When you block or remove an app or game from the App Center or your app settings, they'll no longer be able to access any info about you,” Facebook says on its FAQ.","The issue for many users will be that the social network is increasingly used to log in to third-party applications. Now, platforms which have Facebook integrated let users access them with those credentials instead of an email/password combo.","According to Facebook, apps use your personal information to personalize content, speed up account creation processes and help share the service with friends. But some users still may not realize the true extent of data collection at play.","“When you install an app, you give it permission to access your public profile, which includes your name, profile pictures, username, user ID (account number), networks and any info you choose to make publicly available,” the U.S. social networking giant says online. “You also give the app other info to personalize your experience, including your friends list, gender, age range and locale.”","The case of Cambridge Analytica shows app developers may not always have clear motives for amassing vast quantities of data. Facebook alleges the firm—which worked on Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign—developed a personality test app back in 2014 that could to harvest users’ data without their knowledge.","The Mark Zuckerberg-led website maintains the app developer— Dr. Aleksandr Kogan—violated its Platform Policies by using the personal information and denies it was to blame. “[Users] gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it,” it said.","London-headquartered Cambridge Analytica also denies any wrongdoing.","“As social media sites continue to gather extensive information about their users’ attitudes and behavior, public concern is growing that this information could be exploited,” said Rachel Neaman, CEO of Corsham Institute, a digital rights group. “Whether the issue is legitimate advertising...or fake news, it’s high time that the public were given insight into how they are being targeted and by whom.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Meanwhile, a New York Times story published Saturday claims the firm siphoned off information from the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission.","Despite Cambridge assuring Facebook the data were deleted - Facebook eventually received reports that the data was never disposed of.","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","Cambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix once boasted that his firm had collected as many as 5,000 data points on the 270 million likely American voters - a staggering number, according to Mother Jones.","Looking back, that admission may have been ill-advised: Cambridge Analytica is now embroiled in a lawsuit over whether they need to turn over the data they've collected on individual voters should those voters request it. This threatens to pull back the curtain on methods that the company used to help Trump win - including the rumored use of a technique called psychographics. Psychographics is a groundbreaking data-analysis technique that sounds like something adapted from a bad science-fiction novel.","Cambridge Analytica opened its doors in 2013 and claims to use big data to predict human behavior and influence political elections, according to the company’s website. But what sets Cambridge Analytica apart from other data firms is that it claims to use what’s known as psychographics to build its voter profiles. Many political campaigns have used demographics (e.g., age, race, gender) to target political messaging, and President Obama successfully and famously used consumer data to target voters. But psychographics, in theory, go deeper, claiming to be able to predict a voter’s personality traits, such as how organized, extroverted, or quick to worry they are, by looking at a person’s online and consumer behavior.","Representatives of the company have since tried to walk this back:","To add, even Cambridge Analytica itself is sending mixed messages about the use of psychographics on the Trump campaign. Nix said in that same fall 2016 presentation, “Of the two candidates left in the election, one of them is using these technologies,” referring to Trump. Then, at a December post-election panel hosted by Google, Matt Oczkowski, Cambridge’s head of product, said “I don’t want to break your heart; but we actually didn’t really do any psychographics with the Trump campaign.”","Cambridge Analytica said it's in touch with Facebook in order to resolve the matter as quickly as possible​, according to a company statement on Saturday.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the statement said.","The suspension comes as CA is embroiled in a lawsuit, brought by David Carroll, a media professor at Parsons School of Design, over whether it must turn over the data it has collected on American voters when they request it. While there are no US laws requiring this, CA, being a UK company, is subject to UK laws, that mandate disclosure.","Still, critics of CA have sought to portray the firm as a purveyor of psychological warfare that has actively tried to interfere in international elections. The company has been forced to repeatedly deny allegations that it conspired with Russia to sway the US election in favor of Trump - allegations that surfaced after it was revealed that Nix, the founder of CA, had offered Julian Assange help in releasing Hillary Clinton's stolen emails."],"isopubdate":""}

And while there is no current indication Eunoia used the database or pitched it to Lewandowski, the fact that Wylie's little-known startup — which was a wholly distinct entity from Cambridge Analytica — possessed it at all is the latest in a string of revelations in Facebook's data crisis and further evidence that the company is unable to track how the personal profile information it collects is employed and distributed by third parties.","Other documents from Eunoia, which marketed ad microtargeting services to corporate and political clients, reveal that in the spring of 2015 Wylie’s startup pitched elections-related work to Trump’s eventual campaign manager, Lewandowski. One source, who declined to be named for fear of endangering personal and business relationships confirmed the authenticity of these documents; another person, who had direct knowledge of Eunoia’s meeting with Lewandowski, confirmed the Wylie-led startup’s interest in working for the fledgling Trump campaign.","Since blowing the whistle on Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, Wylie has said very little about Eunoia and his aspirations for it. He also has not spoken at all about his startup’s meeting with Lewandowski, who would go on to lead the Trump campaign. In response to BuzzFeed News’ questions about Eunoia last week, Wylie’s lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that her client “has not worked for Republican clients since leaving [Cambridge Analytica]” and that his company had “no data or assets.”","“Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets.”","The documents obtained by BuzzFeed and subsequent interviews with sources do not always cast Wylie in a flattering light, but they also do not call into question his claims about the improper transfer of Facebook user data to political consulting entities. After responding to an initial request for comment, Wylie's attorney went dark and did not answer the questions BuzzFeed News put to her Tuesday.","In a four-hour hearing of the UK Commons select committee on digital culture, media, and sport on Tuesday, Wylie was asked by committee chair Damian Collins if he had benefited from the GSR data set on other projects that he’d worked on outside of Cambridge Analytica.","“I didn’t do any contracts or do any, you know, work with that data,” Wylie replied. “I haven’t worked with any clients … That data got deleted, I believe, in 2015 on my end.”","“SCL Without Alexander Nix”","Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Wylie discussed plans to “build the NSA’s wet dream” in late 2013 while still working at Cambridge Analytica. “Our goal is first to make it an extremely profitable company,” he wrote in late 2013. “Then we will cleanse our souls with other projects, like using the data for good rather than evil. But evil pays more.\"","According to two people who knew Wylie at this time, the SCL microtargeting specialist had approached a number of colleagues about leaving their jobs to join him in a new company. According to one person, Wylie hoped to model his firm after Palantir Technologies, the CIA-backed, Silicon Valley data-mining company.","“He was very much trying to build this company and his vision was, ‘I want to build SCL without [Cambridge Analytica CEO] Alexander Nix,’” said one person who talked to Wylie about his new venture. Last week, Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix pending an investigation after he was recorded by the UK’s Channel 4 touting his firm’s ability to influence foreign elections and discussing techniques to entrap and blackmail political candidates. Cambridge Analytica did not return a request for comment.","By the beginning of 2014, Wylie had put together a presentation for a company called Arg.us. According to its pitch deck, which was seen and published in part by BuzzFeed News, the company said it could ingest users' social media activity to build “psychographic” profiles for marketers who could then target ads to specific users and possibly influence behavior. By the winter of that year, Wylie was having conversations about his idea with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including one who spoke to BuzzFeed News and received a note that said the products that Wylie had promised had been used for previous political clients.","Wylie’s lawyer previously said that Arg.us presentation was “never a serious pitch,” and it’s not clear how it was used. That said, similarities in documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News suggest it was a precursor to Eunoia.","After leaving Cambridge Analytica and SCL in late June of 2014, Wylie pivoted his focus to Eunoia — Greek for “beautiful thinking” — formulating a company that could perform so-called psychographic modeling and targeting for its clients. By August, he was working at Eunoia with Tobias Kloepper, a one-time SCL data scientist who would obtain Facebook data for the young startup. Emails viewed by BuzzFeed News indicate that Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist and founder of GSR, shared a database of more than 50 million Facebook users with Kloepper.","Kogan and Kloepper did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unclear if Wylie ever used that data, with the whistleblower noting in front of a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that he eventually deleted it because “I wasn’t going to do anything with it.”","Correspondence between Wylie and an acquaintance from September 2014 show that, while Wylie was particularly interested in courting fashion industry clients, he claimed to also have meetings with Monsanto, the American Petroleum Institute, and Ford. A Eunoia fashion-focused presentation from the time obtained by BuzzFeed News said the company had a “database that contains the information of hundreds of millions of individual consumers with emails, Facebook/Twitter IDs and mailing addresses,” while a separate company brochure specifically discusses targeting voters for potential political clients. Neither document mentions the specific GSR data set of 50 million Facebook users, and it’s unclear if Eunoia ever put that data to use.","“The heart of our work stems from a rigorous scientific understanding of human behavior, which in turn allows us to engineer more responsive audiences and engage consumers more precisely,” read the brochure. “To do this, we have developed a series of algorithms that can predict the personality traits of individual voters by analyzing their voterfile [sic], social, online and consumer data.”","Neither the presentation nor the brochure mention the provenance of that \"social, online and consumer data.\"","Provided to BuzzFeed News","A presentation slide for fashion clients from Eunoia Technologies.","According to one person, GSR gave its data to Eunoia after Kogan had negotiated an agreement where the startup would receive the information without charge as part of a data-sharing agreement between the two parties. Wylie never provided Kogan with data of his own, this person said, and GSR moved to cancel its agreements with Eunoia in early 2015. Eunoia appears to never have officially launched; a separate source told BuzzFeed News that it was unable to secure funding.","Data On The Loose","The contested data set, which GSR harvested using a 2014 Facebook personality quiz where users permitted the app to obtain personal information about themselves and their friends, has kick-started investigations from governments around the world. In the US, multiple members of Congress have asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill about the social network’s data policies and how the information of more than 50 million users could have ended up in the hands of a company doing elections consulting work.","As BuzzFeed News has learned, the spread of the Facebook data was not confined to Cambridge Analytica. Wylie may have had access to the data set for more than a year after founding Eunoia, with Facebook only acting to address the violation of its rules in late 2015, after the release of a story in the Guardian. GSR was told to delete its data in December 2015, according to a source, while Wylie said in testimony in front a parliamentary committee Tuesday that he believed he deleted the GSR data “some time in 2015” after being contacted by Kogan.","Earlier this month, after learning that several outlets were working on stories about the Trump campaign–hired data analysis company, the social networking giant moved to suspend the Facebook accounts of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, and Wylie. Facebook declined to comment for this story.","\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post last Wednesday. He added that the company would investigate “all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014.” The company took out full-page ads in several newspapers last Sunday apologizing for the mistake.","Asked last week if Eunoia had used any data sets on Facebook users, Wylie’s lawyer, Allen, was adamant. “Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets,” she wrote.","Provided to BuzzFeed News","Eunoia business cards","Eunoia And Trump’s Campaign Manager","In an interview with NBC’s Today show last week, Wylie drew a line between Cambridge Analytica and Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “What I do know is that Cambridge Analytica was meeting with Corey Lewandowski in 2015 before Trump had even announced and offering the services that I’m talking about right now,” he said.","What Wylie didn’t say is that Eunoia Technologies also met with Lewandowski around the same time. According to one source, Lewandowski met with representatives of the company, including Tadas Jucikas, a former SCL employee, and Mark Gettleson, Eunoia’s communications and marketing strategist, around Easter Sunday 2015 in the lobby of a New York Central Park hotel. Wylie did not attend the meeting, said the person, but he was well aware of it and its purpose to discuss voter microtargeting for a possible presidential candidate.","Drew Angerer / Getty Images","Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski arrives at Trump Tower in December 2016 in New York City.","While Trump’s campaign went on to work with Cambridge Analytica later in 2016, the person said that Lewandowski met with Eunoia, in part, because the Alexander Nix operation was already working for Ted Cruz’s presidential election team at the time. According to that source, that meeting included “high-level discussions” about microtargeting techniques and did not include any talk about Facebook data.","Jucikas declined to comment. Gettleson did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including phone calls, emails, and a visit to his London home. Lewandowski, who became Trump’s official campaign manager when the billionaire announced his candidacy in June 2015, did not respond to a request for comment.","Emails obtained by BuzzFeed News further corroborate the pitch to the Trump campaign. In April 2015, following the meeting with Lewandowski, Gettleson, a political operative with UK’s liberal democratic party, sent an email with the subject line “Trump” to a graphic designer who had been designing business cards and brochures for the company. The email included an attachment labeled “Trump-Handout,” which contained a list of various political microtargeting products and services offered by the company. The graphic designer made a few adjustments to the document and placed its contents on official Eunoia stationery before sending it back to Gettleson in a PDF called “eunioa_stationary_introletter.” It’s unclear if these documents were then sent to Lewandowski or if Eunoia had any further meetings with Trump’s eventual campaign manager.","A cache of documents sent to BuzzFeed News by a source, which included business contracts and pitch decks, reveal other individuals who, to varying degrees, were associated with the fledgling startup. Many of those people did not want to talk about their involvement with the company or did not return BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment. Ray Larson, a former strategist for Canada’s liberal party, did not respond to emails and a phone message; Brent Clickard, a former colleague of Wylie’s at SCL declined to comment. A source close to Clickard said that while he spoke with Wylie about working at Eunoia, the pair never formalized an agreement.","Alfredas Chmieliauskas, a London-based employee of Palantir, said he had “no idea” why his name was on Eunoia’s business documents, adding that while Wylie knew “a former school friend of mine ... we never had a working relationship of any sort.” On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Chmieliauskas, while at Palantir, began corresponding with Wylie in 2013 and later gave him the idea to develop the quiz app, eventually employed by Kogan, to harvest Facebook user data. Wylie also visited with Palantir, with a company spokesperson later confirming that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica considered working together at one point.","Correspondence from Wylie that was given to BuzzFeed News show Wylie bragging to an acquaintance in late 2013 about the prospect of someone from Palantir wanting to join his idea for a startup.","It is not clear if these people, who denied having official work relationships with Eunoia or did not reply altogether, knew that the company had access to a data set with more than 50 million Facebook users or that its associates were meeting with potential presidential campaigns.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record.\"","According to a source, Eunoia also sought to hire Mark Block, the former chief of staff to 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain who had a brief spell of notoriety for smoking a cigarette in a campaign ad. Block’s name and that of his associate, Linda Hansen, were printed on a proof sheet of draft Eunoia business cards given to BuzzFeed News by a second source.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record,” Block said when asked about his relationship with Eunoia and Wylie. Block, who reportedly introduced Steve Bannon to SCL and worked for the company’s elections division as its head of US sales, according to an archived version of SCL’s website, declined to say anything more.","\"There were discussions about politics and some other ex [Cambridge Analytica] staff wanted to continue working in Republican politics,\" Wylie's lawyer said in an email to earlier questions last week. \"However they parted ways with Mr Wylie to set up their own company that does work for Republican clients. ... Mr Wylie has not worked for Republicans since leaving CA and does not wish to in the future.\""],"isopubdate":""}

Read about how we use cookies in our cookie policy and how you can control them by clicking Manage Settings. By continuing to use this site, you accept these cookies.","​How Cambridge Analytica used your Facebook data to help elect Trump","The Russian-linked Cambridge Analytica scammed 50 million US Facebook users for their data. The right-wing, voter-profiling company then used their information to target Americans with personalized anti-Clinton and pro-Trump propaganda.","Donald Trump's improbable rise to the presidency looks dirtier and dirtier. In the latest revelation, Facebook announced on March 18 that University of Cambridge psychology lecturer and St Petersburg university professor Dr Aleksandr Kogan \"lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government, and military work around the globe\".","In partnership with Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), they did that by creating the app, \"thisisyourdigitallife\". This purported to be a personality quiz that was billed as \"a research app used by psychologists\". It was used to spread individually targeted political propaganda.","This seemingly harmless quiz helped gathered, according to Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, \"nearly 5 thousand different data points about you to craft and target a message\".","It was never just the answers people gave to the quiz. The real crown jewel was the open access it gave Cambridge Analytica to their Facebook accounts. According to Wylie, hundreds of thousands of Facebook users took personality tests with the app. In doing so, users consented to their data being collected for academic use. Its use was to prove anything but academic.","At the same time, the app also gathered the test-takers' Facebook friends' personal information. This led for over 50 million users' data being passed on to Cambridge Analytica. This is against Facebook's \"platform policy\" which banned the collection of friends' data for advertising or any reasons besides improving user experience.","Yeah. That worked out well.","This data was then used, as Nix said, to create \"individualised targeted and engagement ads\". The data was analyzed in part with the Big 5 Personality Traits psychological model, aka OCEAN V. The result, according to Nix, might target a religious voter with 30 percent religious-tinted messages, 20 percent gun rights messages, and 30 percent with economic ads, while targeting his NRA member neighbor with mostly gun rights messages on Facebook.","How successful were they? There is no question that social networking played a major factor in the 2016 election. According to Cambridge Analytica lead data scientist David Wilkinson, the company advised Trump's campaign to allocate time and resources to rural voters, especially in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. This led to Cambridge Analytica saying afterwards, according to a resentful former senior Trump technology staffer, \"Look, I'm not saying they lied but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration.\"","Maybe it wasn't that much of an exaggeration.","Many, including the The New York Times, called the incident \"one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history\" and a \"breach\".","Privacy researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis sarcastically tweeted, \"Basically Facebook enabled mass phishing of accounts based on a promise developers wouldn't misuse that data. The system was working as designed, Facebook handed that data over willingly. Therefore their processes were just broken ... it wasn't a breach you see.\"","Facebook was aware that some of its users' data had been misused as early as 2015. Facebook demanded in August 2016 that both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica certify they had deleted the data. This was days before Trump hired Steve Bannon, former Cambridge Analytica vice president, to run his presidential campaign. Only now, as the news leaks, has Facebook admitted publicly that users' data has been harvested.","Cambridge Analytica has denied many of the allegations. The company now claims that when it learned the data \"had not been obtained\" in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted \"all data\" that it received. In addition, Cambridge Analytica now claims \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Sure. Whatever.","There are two morals to this story.","First, if you put any personal information on a public-facing network -- Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever -- you can expect it to be gathered and used. That should be old news to most of you, but people still seemed surprised when they learn how little \"privacy\" there actually is on the net.","Second, no matter how interesting or amusing a Facebook quiz looks, if it requires you to let it access your Facebook account, don't take it. The only purpose of these quizes is to gather your information.","Finally, check to see what apps already have access to your data. Many sites use Facebook Connect logins as their logins. That's fine, but keep in mind if you turn off your Facebook account, you also lose access to these sites. But, there are other apps that you may not be using and are just vacuuming down your data. Delete these. You can do this by going to your Facebook applications setting page."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Cambridge Analytica worked on Donald Trump's presidential campaign.","Since then, Facebook's stock has plunged 18%, wiping out nearly $80 billion from the social networking giant's market value in the process. Zuckerberg's net worth has fallen by about $14 billion. (He is still worth $61 billion, though).","Tech stocks in general have taken a hit since the Facebook allegations first came to light.

That accumulation / deletion / recomposition is now a 736-page book that contains zero tweets. It will be released in May 2018 by Inventory Press. There’s no dedication page, but it’s informally dedicated to the internet. And to Palestine, where most of it was written.","“How do you use a medium against and within its own confines?”","That was the last question I posed out loud to myself about Bio when discussing its motivations, propositions, and process.","Since then excerpts of the project have appeared in The Animated Reader: Poetry of SurroundAudience, an anthology of the 2015 New Museum Triennial (edited by Brian Droitcour).I’ve also had a chance to discuss it in various contexts, most recently in late 2017 at a closed study workshop at Stuart Hall Library in London. Curator Annie Jael Kwan invited me, Sutapa Biswas, Tara Fatehi Irani, Kimvi Nguyen, and Erika Tan to discuss how artists, particularly diasporic women of color, use archives and performance.","Here is a transcript of some of my extemporaneous comments, lightly edited for concision.","“[MMG]: Bio is premised as an internetal performance, and it’s coming out as a text, and I want to talk about the specificity of that word for the project.","“The premise of the archive is that it accumulates, and accretes, and is abundant, and is something I’ve found quite unnerving, and particularly people have talked about artistic biography. But one of the un-satisfying thing about digital architecture and social media, is the way you cannot actually erase yourself. If I were to delete my Twitter history, there’s always a storage centre in Arizona or Taiwan, or somewhere, that has thumbnails and copies, and facsimiles of that tweet in a way that I think, is not only not innocuous politically, but more to the point, quite limiting. I’m really attracted to, historical examples, like Japanese classical artists, who would burn their archives, as artists. Rather than accumulate, they were interested in affluence, but not abundance. And I think there’s a difference between affluence from flow, rather than abundance that’s this thing that accumulates. Accumulating deadens you.","“I found that idea very difficult to activate, and started to look at a link I sent you, which was a self-made image repository of cancelled texts. So artist texts in which something is written and then crossed out—Man Ray, Sandra Hoffman, Anna Maria Maiolino—there are dozens of examples. And I was really interested about thinking about how would an artist in the 21st century approach this, particularly with the space of digital architecture. Or if you like, the virtual realm. And I decided to find a way to do this on Twitter. I was looking for a way to do this on a scroll, and maybe I’ll come to the critical works I was reading at the time.","“Twitter in particular, was interesting, because even though the 140-character Tweets are stored, they are never really deleted. The bio line is not. In other words, there is no algorithm that retains that in any kind of facsimile. For a year [and I was mostly living in Ramallah at the time, without the benefit of reliable wifi], I would update that line—that 160-character line. I was doing so in the context mentioned, the historical lineage I see. And it was in the position of doing something that I’ve long avoided, including avoiding having an artist website, for exactly the same misgivings of archiving yourself, but I kept a material document with these accretions that then got deleted everyday, and then were renewed.","“And then they became this arrangements and compositions in the postscript, with the date rather than a page number. I remember looking at On Kawara’s Western Union Telegrams, in which that was also the case. I think Kawara was really ahead of his time, for using the date of his postcard as a kind of anchoring object/text/material.","“I mentioned a critical text I was reading and I didn’t distribute it to you guys, because it’s literally a blog post. There’s a living theorist, originally Italian, now living in New Zealand, named Giovanni Tiso, and we happen to be Twitter friends. But Giovanni wrote an essay on his blog about problematizing the text and the ‘printernet’ in this current moment, and filling a vacuum of interesting ideas about it. Uninteresting ideas, for me, include things like Kenneth Goldsmith, for whom, just printing out pages of the internet is the printernet, I think that’s really lazy. Giovanni thinks about it as this—if there’s such a thing as a scroll, so a Facebook scroll, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.—open text. It’s when the artist ends the work, or dies, or the profile is hacked, whatever, that it then becomes a text. So Bio, without being published, without being a 736-page book, etc., was already after the end of the project at 365 days, in that premise, a text. And I found that idea, profoundly more interesting, than thinking about well, ‘it’s digital versus it’s paper.’ I thought there’s a lot more to be generated from that distinction between open text, finitude, etc.","“And also my own misgivings, as I mentioned that we can only accrue, we can only accumulate, we can never really die, or delete.","“[KN]: So social media, when you die, it’s like a graveyard, your account still exists. That is really weird.","“[MMG]: Yeah, and I think then that’s a memorial, and that’s a whole other clusterfuck.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-09-17"}

This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.","The plan centers on third-party brokers like Acxiom Corp. and Epsilon Data Management LLC, both of which collect information to package and sell — sometimes to other brokers, other times to marketers who intend to use the insights on platforms like Facebook’s.","Data brokers have been around a while, each collecting information that dates back before the internet was commonly used in most US households. Back then they collected information on your magazine and newspaper subscriptions, whether you owned a home, and how you were likely to vote. Today they know your sexual preferences, what you watch on TV, who your closest friends and family members are, and even whether you prefer a coupe or a sedan. It’s fair to say the internet has upped the ante.","Major players often purchased this bundled data, using that to help segment specific audiences to advertise to on social networks — in this case Facebook. Mudd is correct in saying that it’s common industry practice. Facebook though, provides targeting options that allow marketers to create laser-focused campaigns using the insights, a powerful combination that hadn’t existed just a decade prior — or, even on the same scale five years ago.","Today’s move to shut the door on these companies is a big one for Facebook, a company burdened by the weight of yet another privacy scandal. There’s still work to do, but even I — a self-professed Facebook cynic — commend the company for taking a proactive move rather than its typical reactionary backpedaling after major missteps."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The changes are largely cosmetic, but visual cues, such as a consent interface that encourages users to opt-in to data collection, can make a big difference. Recent consumer outrage has underscored how Facebook’s troubling privacy practices were hidden in the fine print and buried deep in its privacy settings.","As part of Wednesday’s privacy changes, Facebook redesigned its settings menu on mobile devices so that privacy options are available in a single place, rather than spread out across nearly 20 different screens. Facebook will also let users download more of their information than before, so they can see and manage the personal data they’ve shared with Facebook (including new categories such as likes, comments, reactions, search history, and location history), and transfer it to another service, if they choose.","Facebook","Facebook also introduced a new tool called Access Your Information, which allows users to access and delete posts, reactions, comments, and search history.","Facebook","“The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data. We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed,” Erin Egan, vice president and chief privacy officer of policy, and Ashlie Beringer, vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote in a company blog post. The executives stressed that these changes had been in the works for awhile, in addition to privacy improvements that CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised last week, like making it easier for users to revoke access to third parties.","Zuckerberg has faced a maelstrom of criticism following reports that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica misused the personal data of millions of Facebook users. This weekend, Zuckerberg took out a full page ad in major newspapers in the US and UK apologizing for the “breach of trust.” Around the same time, reports surfaced that Facebook had been scraping call and text message data from Android users for years. The company assured irate users that they had opted in to the feature, though some complained they had not realized it.","But Facebook has another major motivator to clean up its privacy act. In May, a new consumer-centric privacy law will go into effect in the European Union called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which severely restricts the collection of personal data and demands increased transparency about how personal data is shared and why it is collected. Violators can face fines of up to 4 percent annual global revenue, which for Facebook could reach as high as $1.6 billion.","In January, Facebook said it would launch a privacy dashboard as part of its GDPR compliance efforts, and today’s announcement is part of that effort. Facebook promised more changes in the coming weeks, including updates to both its terms of service and its data policy, making them more transparent about what data is collected and how that data is used. “These updates are about transparency—not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” the executives wrote in Wednesday’s post."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","He also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it tried to identify via patterns it could identify in big data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” he added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform for some reason.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he added. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The agency, which is tasked with protecting consumers from abusive business practices, has announced that it has opened an investigation of Facebook's handling of user privacy.","According to the FTC, there is an ongoing non-public investigation of the social network. As such, details of the investigation are scarce. However, the FTC notes the issue is related to recent media reports of Facebook's lax privacy practices. It allowed consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to collect data on some 50 million users, and recent reports indicate it sneakily vacuumed up more data than it should have via Android permissions. Although, the latter issue seems to have been blown out of proportion.","Facebook's stock price has slipped another 3% on the news, leaving the company's stock down around 16% in the last few weeks. If the FTC finds Facebook failed to adequately protect its users, it could be fined as much as $40,000 per violation. That could, theoretically, mean a $2 trillion fine. That's obviously not going to happen, but the FTC could still hit Facebook with a big bill to pay.","I just post memes and inspiring quotes on my Facebook account.

In short, what was Mark Zuckerberg thinking?","What makes recent disclosures about illicit uses of Facebook data so exasperating to opinion leaders and millions of everyday users is the delayed, disingenuous and tone-deaf responses from corporate management. It took five days from the publication of bombshell exposés in the New York Times and Observer, during which Facebook shed nearly $50 billion in market value, before the company’s two top executives finally issued what was widely considered to be an inadequate response.","During the protracted silence from Facebook’s CEO and COO, other senior company executives took to Twitter and Facebook to deny corporate culpability. One post vigorously disputed that Facebook’s systems had been breached, insisting on a technically correct, but blame-shifting explanation: “This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","This semantics lesson on the meaning of “breach” provided little comfort to users, who rarely parse the fine print in Facebook’s terms of service, and in any event expect Facebook to protect their private data from harmful and unauthorized use. As Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged in his long-awaited response (on Facebook of course), “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. “","In another instance of Facebook’s inadequate initial response, a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast, “The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","But Facebook’s outrage was too little, too late, as the cause of the company’s breach of trust should have been recognized and forcefully addressed over three years earlier. In 2014, a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan gave a publicized speech in Singapore, describing how he was able to analyze a sample of over 50 million Facebook users for whom he developed “the ability to predict virtually any trait.” Kogan also boasted of having built a database of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012.","One year later, The Guardian published a detailed account of how campaign consultancy Cambridge Analytica − who had paid to gain access to Kogan’s massive database on unwitting US Facebook users − was using detailed psychological profiles on the US electorate for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. In response, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to certify (as in “check the box on this form”) that they had destroyed the ill-gotten user data. But Facebook failed to pursue any forensic follow up to ensure that this dangerously potent asset had in fact been wiped clean.","In early 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and paid the firm over $6 million with the remit to provide a wide range of services including data analytics, voter profiling, micro-targeting, social media message development, digital marketing and campaign planning. Did Cambridge Analytica continue to use its ill-gotten massive Facebook database on behalf of the Trump campaign? Circumstantial evidence certainly points in that direction. Whistleblower Chris Wylie has recounted that Cambridge Analytica board member Steve Bannon had exhorted employees to weaponize psychological profiling in a self-proclaimed “win-at-any-cost” culture war being fought on the 2016 election battlefield. The Financial Times reported that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, boasted of using “a massive database of [nearly] 5,000 data points on every adult in America” to support the successful Trump campaign. And immediately after the election, Cambridge Analytica took credit for the win, claiming that its data helped to place targeted online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times.","In his belated mea culpa, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook “made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” But the company’s track record of systemic failures to protect user privacy or to prevent malevolent uses of its proprietary database suggests that were it not for investigative reporting by the New York Times, Observer and undercover reporting by Channel 4 News in London, we probably would not be having an urgent public discourse on Facebook’s management shortcomings today.","Why has Facebook consistently struggled to protect its users’ personal information and to prevent malicious exploitation of its platform?","Going forward, can we trust Facebook to “take whatever steps are required” to address serious concerns with their business practices?","The most common answer to the first question is that Facebook’s business model inexorably drives their observed behavior. After all, Facebook’s success is built on amassing (or less charitably, surveilling) information on consumer behavior, enabling it to sell targeted advertising that delivers superior marketing ROI. This devilishly effective business model has enabled Facebook to create an extraordinarily profitable enterprise – in round numbers, a $50 billion revenue run rate, growing at 50% per year with 50% operating margins. It is thus not surprising that the company would be reluctant to tinker with such successful business practices.","The Perfect Storm Behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Corporate Myopia","But there is deeper dynamic at play that explains Facebook’s chronic inability to recognize the potential societal harm and reputational risk that its platform can and has engendered. Mark Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia results from the perfect storm of three leadership mindsets.","Hubristic vision and soaring ambition to change the world for the better","Overconfidence in the power of technology to solve virtually any problem","A tendency to underestimate “black swan” risks","While these management mindsets are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, when applied in a company of Facebook’s scale, the consequences can be catastrophic.","Mark Zuckerberg passionately believes that the company he founded nearly fifteen years ago has emerged as a uniquely powerful global force for good. He has often proclaimed that the Internet should be considered, like health care and clean water, a basic human right. And within that realm, Zuckerberg regards peer-to-peer communications as a powerful enabler of the company’s mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”","Guided by such an altruistic vision, Zuckerberg propelled Facebook’s rapid growth by aggressively pursuing more data, more media, more interactions inside and beyond the platform, more functionality, more user engagement and more global scale and reach. But in retrospect, the company’s fateful error was Zuckerberg’s decision to share user data with outside app developers starting in 2008 (expanded further between 2011 and 2014) in exchange for enhancing Facebook’s functionality and the ability to track its users beyond its platform. By extending Facebook’s surveillance beyond the walled garden of internally generated user data, the company signaled its preference for more data acquisition and portability over safeguarding user privacy.","MAU growthAuthor analysis from company data","Along the way, Facebook certainly was aware of “bad actors” on its platform − the ones that bully users, plant fake news for profit, mindless fun or influence, or who promote fraudulent commerce. But Zuckerberg has consistently exuded confidence that his company’s sophisticated software could detect and prevent malevolent abuses on his platform, despite alarming evidence that Facebook’s bad actor problem has been worsening for years.","There were plenty of reasons for Zuckerberg to overlook danger signs bubbling below the surface of Facebook’s business. By any measure, Facebook had been spectacularly successful in creating a global juggernaut. By the end of 2017, Facebook was serving over 2 billion users and more than 5 million advertisers, rewarding shareholders (including its largest stakeholder, Mark Zuckerberg) with a company valued in excess of one-half trillion dollars.","Such outsized success undoubtedly contributed to Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia in failing to recognize and mitigate the risks of rare, but potentially catastrophic abuses on his platform. Best-selling author and scholar Nassim Taleb has written extensively on the common human tendency to underestimate the likelihood of “black swan” events − defined as situations with low probability but extremely high downside risk. For example, black swan myopia arguably contributed to the lax risk management that led to a number of preventable disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the financial services meltdown of 2008.","In Facebook’s case, black swan myopia led Mark Zuckerberg to largely ignore the reputational risk posed by the malevolent use of Facebook user data before, during and after the 2016 presidential election. Before Cambridge Analytica even began working for the Trump campaign, Facebook failed to verify that the consultancy had actually destroyed its large illicit cache of Facebook user data. During the campaign, Facebook continued to ignore growing reports that the Trump campaign was effectively deploying psychological profiling and micro-targeting techniques, rife with fake news and targeted imagery in pivotal swing states.","And even after President Trump’s gobsmacking victory, Zuckerberg continued to proclaim that the notion that fake news could have influenced the U.S. presidential election was a \"pretty crazy idea,\" going on to dismiss the importance of filter bubbles and claiming that fake news represents a \"very small volume\" of the total content on Facebook’s platform.","Zuckerberg’s stubborn denial of the ability of Cambridge Analytica and other foreign political operatives to exploit Facebook’s data and platform to influence voter behavior is bizarrely hypocritical, since the secret sauce that has always driven Facebook’s profitability is its proven ability to enable advertisers to precisely tailor product messaging to targeted prospective customers.","According to whistleblower Chris Wylie, Steve Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the stated objective of using psychological profiling tools to change voters’ cultural attitudes. In fighting a self-proclaimed culture war, Bannon understood that micro-targeting − akin to smart bombs − could be far more cost effective than carpet bombing political ads on mass media. Cambridge Analytica arguably was in a position to be particularly effective in this regard because they illicitly gained the access to Facebook’s vast user database to build detailed psychological profiling models.","Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in falling prey to the perfect storm of corporate myopia. One could argue that Travis Kalanick at Uber and Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos also had hubristic visions to change the world for the better, coupled with overconfidence in the infallibility of their technology and an inability to recognize black swan risks threatening to damage their company and the world at large. Kalanick was ultimately forced to resign from Uber by his board, and Holmes recently settled a lawsuit with the SEC that forced her to forfeit control of Theranos, now in tatters.","There are of course key differences in Zuckerberg’s case. Unlike the other two executives, Facebook has been spectacularly profitable, and Zuckerberg enjoys bulletproof shareholder control of his company. Under these circumstances, the question is, how will Mark Zuckerberg address the growing challenges threatening Facebook’s future?","Can Zuckerberg Clean Up Facebook’s Mess?","The key to answering this question lies in understanding what problem Mark Zuckerberg will choose to address: quelling the current uproar over the Cambridge Analytica debacle, or addressing broader, longstanding concerns with Facebook’s unprecedented global power to control access to information hiding behind its opaque business practices.","Zuckerberg’s mea culpa media tour starting March 21st clearly signaled his primary interest on the first problem. In his interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher, Zuckerberg opined “the good news is that as of three or four years ago, new apps weren’t able to do what happened here. So this is largely ... this issue is resolved going forward for a while.” As Swisher rightfully observed, Zuckerberg’s comments were predominantly backward-looking, and inadequately recognized the broader challenges that lie ahead.","By focusing Facebook’s attention on tracking down possible terms of service violations by thousands of third party developers many years ago, and promising new controls on developer platform access, Zuckerberg framed Facebook’s problem entirely in terms of external data portability, ignoring the fact that through these interactions, Facebook also amassed and retains extensive data on user behavior for its own commercial purposes.","Worries over just how much user data Facebook routinely collects and how that information is used erupted again this week when press accounts revealed that Facebook has been logging Android users’ telephone calls and SMS messages for years. As with prior concerns expressed over the company’s expansive data capture, Facebook reprised its typical response: “we never sell your data and trust us, having all this information helps us provide a better user experience on our platform.”","But a growing chorus of political leaders no longer trusts Facebook’s blame-shifting apologies and repeated assurances of altruistic intent, and are now calling for the company’s CEO to testify before Congress on a broad range of data privacy concerns. The FTC has also weighed in, opening an investigation to determine whether Facebook’s business practices have been violating a 2011 agreement settling charges over the company’s user privacy policies.","So how can we expect Facebook to respond? Given Mark Zuckerberg’s management mindset, and the company’s track record in dealing with past crises, it would take overwhelming pressure from the government or other key stakeholders for Facebook to move beyond reactive tweaks to its business practices. The harsh reality is, Facebook’s stakeholders are unlikely to mount a serious and sustained challenge to the company’s status quo.","Users","The potential for a user revolt clearly poses the gravest threat to Facebook’s market dominance, which explains why Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have devoted so much of their apology tour last week seeking to restore user trust. Facebook executives are well aware that Uber reportedly lost as much as 15 percentage points of market share in major US metro markets last year after a #deleteuber campaign erupted over the company’s alleged mishandling of its response to protests over President Trump’s Muslim country travel ban. In Uber’s case, consumers had a readily available choice to switch to a competitor (Lyft) offering an essentially comparable service.","Facebook’s situation is considerably different. Despite the genuine outrage expressed over recent damaging revelations, isolated calls to #deletefacebook have failed to gain much traction simply because Facebook is too deeply embedded in the lives of its 2 billion users. Consciously or unwittingly, the vast majority of Facebook users appear to have accepted the Faustian bargain of trading their personal data for free access to Facebook’s valued services. Don’t expect many Facebook or Instagram users to switch to Snapchat any time soon.","Advertisers","As long as users remain engaged on the platform, advertisers will be understandably reluctant to exclude Facebook from their advertising mix. No platform provides nearly as much market reach, targeting effectiveness or useful ROI tracking tools as Facebook. Consequently, why would Facebook’s 5 million advertisers be willing to cede such advantages to competitors? While a few companies have in fact announced a temporary suspension of Facebook advertising (e.g., Pep Boys, Sonos, Commerzbank), Facebook is likely to remain a dominant a channel for most advertisers in the months ahead.","Investors/Government","As long as users and advertisers stay on board, many investors are likely to follow suit. Facebook’s recent loss of market value largely reflects current investor nervousness over the prospect for restrictive government regulation. Mark Zuckerberg surprisingly fanned the flames of investor concern by signaling his support for appropriate regulatory controls.","But there are reasons to doubt that government action will be swift, comprehensive or overly damaging to Facebook’s business model. For starters, President Trump will obviously seek to discourage debate on an issue that relitigates the legitimacy of his 2016 election. On Capitol Hill, Congress already has a full agenda of more pressing political issues to deal with, going into the 2018 midterm elections. As such, today’s announcement that the FTC is launching an investigation of Facebook may give Congress cover to pass the baton in dealing with this gnarly issue.","It would not be surprising to see Facebook voluntarily announcing a few enhancements to its data privacy policies in the coming months to diminish the perceived urgency for comprehensive government regulation. These dynamics suggest that government action is likely to be slow and measured at best, giving investors time to monitor and react to Facebook’s actual financial performance in the months ahead, which promises to remain strong.","Board of directors","Facebook has a distinguished board that in normal circumstances could be counted on to exert strong oversight over the company's operational and reputational risk management. But a board can go only so far in reining in a CEO who controls 60% of the voting shares of the fifth largest publicly traded company in the world. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to be the loudest voice in the room in guiding Facebook’s strategic direction.","Competitors","What competitors? Facebook has exploited strong network economies of scale and a relentless appetite to acquire or replicate the services of upstart competitors. While it is true that Facebook will likely be barred from additional major acquisitions, the company has already built a seemingly unassailable lead over competitors in the advertising-supported social media space. Even if Congress does act to impose limits on future user data sourcing and portability, it may actually strengthen Facebook’s current competitive advantage given that it already has by far the biggest user database in the industry.","So where does that leave us? In the months ahead, we’re likely to see a number of incremental improvements in Facebook’s business practices through a combination of voluntary company policy changes and possible regulatory reforms governing the allowable sourcing and use of personal data.","Greater transparency in identifying the sponsors and content of targeted ads on Facebook’s platform (particularly those involving political content)","Tighter controls over user data portability across the Internet","More stringent requirements for users to be asked for opt-in permission (in clear language) before Facebook can collect and store user data.","These welcome changes will not unduly crimp Facebook’s extraordinarily successful business model, and may even help Mark Zuckerberg overcome his corporate myopia that has exposed the company to preventable reputational risk in the past. Whether we “Like” it or not, we’re destined to live in the social media world we collectively helped Facebook build for many more years to come.","I am an Executive in Residence and Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, teaching courses in business strategy and corporate entrepreneurship.

Which wouldn't matter, except that it is genuinely harder and harder to make any kind of way as a writer without doing some of this stuff - not least because publishers will be wary of a writer who is invisible in social media terms.","But the good news is that it's perfectly possible to have a useful presence out there. So to that end I've asked Anita Chapman, who as Neets Marketing runs courses in social media management for authors and publishers, to talk about how you can get involved without selling either your soul or your entire working life.","And the other good news is that it can be fun. I've taken part in some really good discussions of writing topics with some well-known writers, all in 240-character tweets, I've made contacts that have resulted people buying my book and offering me work, and it's the main way I keep in touch with my writer friends and potential colleagues and collaborators all round the world.","So, in the Itch spirit of overcoming the fear by understanding more clearly what's involved, over to Anita!","Over the past few years, I’ve trained and worked with unpublished writers; and authors who write for traditional publishers, and who are self-published. Emma invited me to write about social media for aspiring and new writers, and for anyone who feels a bit daunted by it all, so hopefully the following post will take away some of that fear that can stop you from getting started.","Why do writers need to use social media?","These days, authors are expected to have social media accounts set up, and to know how to use them, whether they’re published traditionally, by a corporate or independent publisher. And of course, if you decide to self-publish, you will do all of the marketing yourself. If you’re unpublished, but submitting to agents and publishers, it’s a good idea to set up social media accounts and a blog now.","Many authors set up social media accounts and start a blog before they’re published. When a book is released, there is so much to do already. In the run up to publication date, there are deadlines to meet and often the next book to write or edit, guest posts to draft and interview questions to answer for a blog tour*. And then there’s the hunting down of the right outfit and cake for that launch (ha) as well as other stuff. The last thing you need is to be learning how to use social media then, and unfortunately it’s not possible to build an online presence in the two week period before your book comes out.","I know authors who have been in that situation, who wished they’d started sooner, but then built their presence steadily before the next book, and are now doing really well. If you’re in that situation, don’t worry - just think about moving forwards and plan for the next book. Blog tours can be arranged between books as well as around the time of launches too.","And if, when you get that book deal, your publisher asks you to write under a different name, you’ve already learnt how to use social media and built your network; and you can change the name on your social media accounts - so I wouldn’t let that stop you from setting up accounts now.","Where does the fear come from?","The fear mainly relates to unpublished writers not feeling worthy, not knowing how to deal with potential unpleasantness (which is talked about in the press a lot), and not knowing what to do. There’s also the worry that strangers can see what you post online.","How can you protect yourself online?","You can block and report accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram; and you can set up posts on Facebook to be seen by certain friends only. On Facebook, if anyone is being unpleasant, you can unfriend them. You can also choose who sends you friend requests and who to accept as a friend. Check Privacy, Timeline and Tagging, and Apps under Settings on Facebook especially carefully (also see my postscript below, in relation to the recent Cambridge Analytica data breach).","If revealing too much of your personal life to strangers is a concern, think before posting photos of your family and where you live and post photos of places you visit only after you leave.","How can writers get started on social media?","Start with Twitter, Facebook and if you have time, Instagram which is growing in popularity. Observe those authors who use social media well, and start to build your online presence. It takes time to gain the right followers, i.e. other writers and authors, and those in the book world as you grow your network; plus book bloggers, booksellers, librarians, potential readers, and followers relating to your brand who may help to spread the word about your books (see “What’s your brand?” below). Build your online presence slowly and steadily, looking for those Twitter and Instagram followers mentioned above.","On Twitter, try not to just retweet. Quote tweets, adding your own comment. Create your own tweets relating to your brand (see below) or to what’s trending (a nice easy way to get started, and to get your profile out there). Get to know the writing community by taking part in writing chats such as #WritersWise #writingchat #histficchat, and use hashtags for writers such as #amwriting (there are many others – see my post on hashtags to understand what they are and how to use them).","On Facebook, make friends with other writers, authors, book bloggers and join Facebook groups for writers and bloggers, as well as those relating to subjects and themes from your books, and your interests. Before your book is released, you can set up a Facebook Page so readers can keep up-to-date with your news, but Facebook Pages tend only to be effective (i.e. Facebook shows these posts in News Feeds) when you pay to boost posts or create adverts using Ads Manager.","If you can, set up a blog and learn how to write an effective blog post, i.e. one that gets the page views. This is good practice for when you write guest posts for blog tours.","Who is the online you?","Decide how much of you, you want to give online. Will you talk about your family and your personal life, your political views, or will you keep your online presence just about writing and general interests? If your book is a memoir or about something going on in your life, then you may want to share more of yourself online.","Be aware that if you talk about politics, religion, big issues, there will be tweet replies and Facebook comments which disagree with you (some more diplomatic than others), and it’s worth thinking about whether you want to, and are able to deal with this. Make these decisions early on, and don’t go on social media after a few drinks – I have seen many a Facebook post and tweet deleted the morning after the night before.","What’s your brand?","Think about what defines you and your books and aim to focus on those subjects and themes when you post on social media.","Getting past the fear factor:","Just get stuck in. You’ll need to invest time in social media to be successful, and make it part of your life. Building your presence slowly and steadily works well, if you haven’t got that book deal yet. Observing those who know what they’re doing is key. It’s better to make a beginner’s mistake before you’re published (such as copying in lots of people on a series of tweets which have nothing to do with them), and of course, don’t say anything online which is offensive to others. I’ve heard stories about authors not being taken on by agents and publishers because their social media accounts haven’t shown them in the best light. It’s worth thinking carefully about what you’d like agents and publishers to see if they google you or look at your social media accounts.","My social media blog for writers includes how-to posts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, blogging and more. Many author guests have visited to give their advice on book marketing and social media too (see my bio below for the link). Good luck!","*What is a Blog Tour? Authors often take part in a blog tour near to the publication date of their book. It can last for a week, two weeks and occasionally a month; with usually a series of daily (one or more) guest posts/interviews and reviews from advance copies of the book (known as ARCs) appearing on book blogger blogs. Guest posts can be on other types of blogs too. Blog tours are often organised by publishers, and also authors by approaching bloggers directly or via a blog tour organiser.","postscript: The above post was written before the Cambridge Analytica data breach revelations, and this article, at The Guardian explains how to protect your privacy settings on Facebook.

Check Privacy, Timeline and Tagging, and Apps under Settings on Facebook especially carefully (also see my postscript below, in relation to the recent Cambridge Analytica data breach).","If revealing too much of your personal life to strangers is a concern, think before posting photos of your family and where you live and post photos of places you visit only after you leave.","How can writers get started on social media?","Start with Twitter, Facebook and if you have time, Instagram which is growing in popularity. Observe those authors who use social media well, and start to build your online presence. It takes time to gain the right followers, i.e. other writers and authors, and those in the book world as you grow your network; plus book bloggers, booksellers, librarians, potential readers, and followers relating to your brand who may help to spread the word about your books (see “What’s your brand?” below). Build your online presence slowly and steadily, looking for those Twitter and Instagram followers mentioned above.","On Twitter, try not to just retweet. Quote tweets, adding your own comment. Create your own tweets relating to your brand (see below) or to what’s trending (a nice easy way to get started, and to get your profile out there). Get to know the writing community by taking part in writing chats such as #WritersWise #writingchat #histficchat, and use hashtags for writers such as #amwriting (there are many others – see my post on hashtags to understand what they are and how to use them).","On Facebook, make friends with other writers, authors, book bloggers and join Facebook groups for writers and bloggers, as well as those relating to subjects and themes from your books, and your interests. Before your book is released, you can set up a Facebook Page so readers can keep up-to-date with your news, but Facebook Pages tend only to be effective (i.e. Facebook shows these posts in News Feeds) when you pay to boost posts or create adverts using Ads Manager.","If you can, set up a blog and learn how to write an effective blog post, i.e. one that gets the page views. This is good practice for when you write guest posts for blog tours.","Who is the online you?","Decide how much of you, you want to give online. Will you talk about your family and your personal life, your political views, or will you keep your online presence just about writing and general interests? If your book is a memoir or about something going on in your life, then you may want to share more of yourself online.","Be aware that if you talk about politics, religion, big issues, there will be tweet replies and Facebook comments which disagree with you (some more diplomatic than others), and it’s worth thinking about whether you want to, and are able to deal with this. Make these decisions early on, and don’t go on social media after a few drinks – I have seen many a Facebook post and tweet deleted the morning after the night before.","What’s your brand?","Think about what defines you and your books and aim to focus on those subjects and themes when you post on social media.","Getting past the fear factor:","Just get stuck in. You’ll need to invest time in social media to be successful, and make it part of your life. Building your presence slowly and steadily works well, if you haven’t got that book deal yet. Observing those who know what they’re doing is key. It’s better to make a beginner’s mistake before you’re published (such as copying in lots of people on a series of tweets which have nothing to do with them), and of course, don’t say anything online which is offensive to others. I’ve heard stories about authors not being taken on by agents and publishers because their social media accounts haven’t shown them in the best light. It’s worth thinking carefully about what you’d like agents and publishers to see if they google you or look at your social media accounts.","My social media blog for writers includes how-to posts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, blogging and more. Many author guests have visited to give their advice on book marketing and social media too (see my bio below for the link). Good luck!","*What is a Blog Tour? Authors often take part in a blog tour near to the publication date of their book. It can last for a week, two weeks and occasionally a month; with usually a series of daily (one or more) guest posts/interviews and reviews from advance copies of the book (known as ARCs) appearing on book blogger blogs. Guest posts can be on other types of blogs too. Blog tours are often organised by publishers, and also authors by approaching bloggers directly or via a blog tour organiser.","postscript: The above post was written before the Cambridge Analytica data breach revelations, and this article, at The Guardian explains how to protect your privacy settings on Facebook.

Pham Van Hoi, manager of a media company in Hanoi, said, “Facebook user data has long stopped being private.” A dozens of computer applications were created by developers to scan Facebook User ID (UID) to get related information. UID is similar to the identification number (ID) that Facebook gives to users and it is also the only way to identify a person. Through UID, scanning tools can access the data store for retrieving a person’s name, date of birth, gender, address, and even that person’s public friend list, then save it in an Excel file. A tool allowed to get the information of Facebook users Hoi also said that before June 2015 Facebook allowed ads to run directly with UID, which means that advertisers could target customers with greater accuracy. However, later the social network has stopped these kinds of ads, but they still indirectly run via phone or email (except the address of @facebook.com). Therefore, with some converters, Facebook users’ data can be used for marketing purposes. With monthly subscription fees going from hundreds to several millions of VND, the application can filter Facebook users’ private data for many different purposes.

Thom Tillis win his seat in 2014.","North Carolina voters were among the first in the U.S. to be targeted by Cambridge Analytica, which boasted that its cache of \"psychographic data\" could be used to build personality profiles of voters and target political ads at them to influence their behavior.","Much of that data appears to have come from Facebook profiles.","One of the founders of Cambridge Analytica said the firm bought Facebook data, starting in 2014, from a Russia-linked researcher who claimed he was gathering it for academic study. It was gathered using a Facebook personality quiz that also took personal data from a user's friends without their knowledge.","Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Facebook reportedly learned of the data breach more than two years ago but did not tell users. Instead, the social media giant told Cambridge Analytica to delete the unauthorized data. The firm claimed it did, but copies of the database still exist.","In 2014, Tillis' campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $30,000, and the North Carolina Republican Party paid $150,000, making the GOP the company's fourth-largest client that year. The party also paid the firm $65,000 in 2015.","\"CA Political was contracted to provide modeled data and data analysis on partisanship, turnout, issue importance and personality profile for North Carolina GOP in the race between Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Kay Hagan,\" the case study states. \"Harnessing our unique data-rich voter file, we were able to accurately predict partisanship, turnout, issue importance and build psychographic profiles for all voters in North Carolina. We produced clusters of voters based on the modeled data to maximize campaign impact, which enabled the creation of tailored messages directed at those audiences.\"","Those messages went out, according to the case study, in the form of direct mail and get-out-the-vote calls to more than 128,000 voters, increasing turnout by more than 12 percent.","Tillis defeated Hagan by fewer than 50,000 votes following a campaign marked by one negative ad after another on both sides.","Cambridge Analytica's third-largest client in 2014, the John Bolton SuperPAC, was also highly active in the Tillis/Hagan race, spending nearly $1.5 million to benefit Tillis and damage Hagan. The super-PAC spent $341,000 with the company for messaging consulting.","Tillis didn't respond Monday to repeated requests for comment on the allegations against Cambridge Analytica’s methods. Republican 10th District Congressman Patrick McHenry, whose campaign also spent $15,000 on Cambridge Analytica’s services in 2014, also didn't respond to requests for comment.","Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the state Republican Party, said the party uses the Republican National Committee for voter data and never used Cambridge Analytica for that purpose.","\"The vendor in question was one of several contracted to do work on the party's direct mail program. The company was not hired and did not do social media work for the party,\" Woodhouse, who didn't work for the GOP in 2014, said in an email. \"They have not been engaged in nearly four years, and there are no plans to use the company in the future. Any vendor that operated in less than a transparently ethical manner is forbidden from future work.\"","Still, North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin said the new revelations raise a lot of questions about what the GOP, Tillis or McHenry knew about Cambridge Analytica, what they asked the firm to do and when they found out about its connections to Russia.","\"I don't know if it had any direct impact but it certainly was a trial run for what happened in 2016 here in the elections across our country,\" Goodwin said. \"I would never have thought that North Carolina would have been the guinea pig for this type of activity.\"","President Donald Trump used Cambridge Analytica in his general election campaign in 2016.","The company is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","Goodwin said many questions need to be answered to safeguard the integrity of elections in the social media age.","\"We can't control or know the algorithms of what data, what ads, what information – fake news, real news – we don't know what all is sent our way,\" he said. \"If you're bombarded with this stuff by someone who's weaponizing data tuned in just to what your trigger points are, no telling what the outcome could be at election time.\"","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to WRAL News' request for comment.","William ShermanMar 20, 2018","View quoted thread","a perfect example of voter manipulation thru fake news- the Steele Dossier was NEVER public until after the 2016 election.

Fox News has been the most watched cable news network in the country for 12 straight years, regularly pulling in more viewers than CNN and MSNBC combined. During the first Republican primary debate of this season, Fox clocked its most-ever (24 million) viewers, making the two-hour show the highest-rated non-sports cable telecast of all time.","Over the last ten years, everyone I know has lost a friend or family member or mentor to Fox News. Like me, they have watched helplessly as people they love have become part of the conservative punditry herd and, over time, traded their compassion for paranoia; their thoughtful opinions for manufactured outrage; and their empathy for hateful rhetoric. These people — these moms and dads and aunts and uncles and grandparents and brothers and sisters and pastors and politicians and friends — have been deceived into believing that Fox News and Fox-approved talk radio hosts provide the only commentary they can trust.","What these people so dear to us fail to understand is that Fox News is not only uninterested in being fair and balanced; it is also uninterested in being a reliable source of news. That’s because Fox News is playing a zero-sum political game in which every major news story is an opportunity to use their viewers as pawns to advance the power and agenda of the most extremist ideology of the Republican Party.","Consider Trayvon Martin. After he was murdered by George Zimmerman, multiple journalists pointed out that Fox News had been oddly silent on the subject. Until they had a firm grasp on how to mold the story to their benefit, they refused to report on it. Then, as Media Matters senior fellow Eric Boehlert explains: “Obama addressed it, and once Obama enters the conversation about race, you know, [Fox News] went from zero to a hundred … they decided that the story was partisan, and that supporting Trayvon Martin was the Democratic position, supporting the guy who killed an unarmed teen was the Republican conservative position, and so they set up the markers, and went for it.”","When a grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson for the murder of Michael Brown, Sean Hannity proved Boehlert’s claim. Hannity was practically giddy when he announced to his audience: “Zero for three, a three-time loser! President Obama on high-profile race cases.”","Study after study after study after study has shown that Fox News viewers are the most uninformed and misinformed people in America. One recent study even found that people who didn’t watch any news programs at all had a firmer grasp on the reality of current events than those who only watched Fox News.","Rather than adhering to any kind of journalistic standard when reporting the news, or — as is the case with liberal-leaning MSNBC — reporting truthfully on the news and offering ideological commentary grounded in facts, Fox News starts with their end goal in mind and works backwards. How can a news story be used to damage their viewers’ perceptions of President Obama or the Democratic Party? How can a news story be used to bolster Republican politicians, or advance the causes of Republican-leaning policy influencers like the National Rifle Association or evangelical Christians? How can a news story be used to vilify causes championed by progressive Americans?","Once they’ve settled on the outcome they want, Fox News shapes its narrative and sets in motion its brainwashing cycle.","Fox News’ use of propaganda to isolate and indoctrinate its viewers is deliberate and terrifyingly effective. It thrives off of fear-based sexism, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, and dogmatic intolerance toward anyone who is not a straight, white Christian.","The Fox News Propaganda Cycle","I’ve been studying Fox News’ methodology since 2004, when I saw someone I love get pulled into their orbit and transformed for the first time. This article is the culmination of all my research. Below you’ll see a chart I made outlining the way Fox News and their talk radio counterparts use classic propaganda techniques to isolate and indoctrinate their viewers/listeners. And below that, you’ll find an explanation of each technique, along with examples of what these methods look like in action. There are thousands of examples to choose from. I only picked a handful.","Isolate Viewers","“When you’ve got the national liberal media working compulsively on your behalf, it is very difficult to break through the noise to the reality.” – Lou Dobbs, November 2012","“The liberal elite” is a concept created by Richard Nixon’s campaign during his bid for presidency in 1960. Feminists who were advocating for workplace equality; black people who were working to end racist violence, segregation, and laws against interracial marriage; and anti-war demonstrators who were weary of the war in Vietnam were making white men uneasy, so the Nixon campaign began branding those activists and their sympathizers as “the liberal elite.” Good old hardworking white men like Nixon were the real Americans, and the “liberal elite” were a threat to a traditional, God-approved, Founding Fathers-sanctioned way of life.","Fox News has piggybacked off Nixon’s strategy and expanded it with wild success.","False Dichotomies","Creating a false dichotomy is a propaganda technique used to oversimplify complicated issues and force people to believe they have an either/or choice. The group creating the false dichotomy knows many choices are available, but for their message to be successful, they must convince listeners that their choices are limited. Fox News and its talk radio counterparts don’t simply position themselves against MSNBC; they position themselves against literally every other source of information. You can choose the good guy, or you can choose the bad guy. You can get your news from Fox and Fox-approved talk radio hosts (true patriots who are trying to save the country) or you can get your news from the liberal media (deceitful or delusional people who are trying to destroy the country).","Maintaining a false dichotomy is essential for Fox News. If their viewers receive information or analysis from any other group, no matter how apolitical or nonpartisan that group is, viewers will be forced to confront the misinformation that is pressed onto them by Fox News.","Ad Nauseam","Ad nauseam is a propaganda tactic that involves repeating a phrase or an idea over and over and over until an audience begins to accept it as fact. Fox News uses the ad nauseam technique in every step of their propaganda cycle, but it’s most crucial in the isolation phase because it’s most effective when a viewer/listener’s media sources are limited. After creating the false dichotomy between Fox and every other news source, Fox pundits scorn the “liberal media” or “mainstream media” with relentless fervor. Political wins that don’t line up with conservative ideology are caused by the evil liberal media. Anyone who questions Fox News is part of the lying liberal media. If you read something on the internet that made you doubt Fox News, it’s because the internet is controlled by the manipulative liberal media.","Hour after hour, day after day, Fox uses the phrases “liberal media” and “mainstream media” to perpetually reinforce the false dichotomy that isolates Fox viewers from reality.","Confirmation Bias and Cognitive Dissonance","Once a person has settled on a core belief, they are likely to seek out information that validates that belief and avoid information that challenges it. They are also more likely to bend evidence to fit inside the paradigm of their belief than they are to alter their belief to align with evidence suggesting their belief is incorrect. The practice of accepting only information that confirms something you already believe while rejecting any information that challenges that belief is called confirmation bias. Having core beliefs challenged causes cognitive dissonance.","One of the main reasons Fox News is so effective at using cognitive dissonance to keep people away from other news sources is that Fox has strategically aligned itself with evangelical Christianity. So, if one of Fox News’ teachings is called into question, Fox itself is called into question; and if Fox is synonymous with God’s politics, God’s politics are called into question; and if God’s politics are called into question, God is called into question. Therefore, any challenge to Fox is framed as an attack on God himself.","Creating cognitive dissonance by framing oneself as God’s true ally and spokesperson is one of the most powerful propaganda techniques of all time. It has worked for fascists on a national scale and it has worked for cult leaders operating out of barns. It is especially compelling in the United States, where our belief that we are God’s chosen people has been methodically woven into our national identity since John Winthrop gave his “City on a Hill” speech in 1630, before ever setting foot on this continent.","Create Enemy","“The days of [minorities] not having any power are over, and they are angry. And they want to use their power as a means of retribution.” – Rush Limbaugh, June 2009","“This is the new America; this ain’t your father’s America.” – Dick Morris, November 2012","The most important component of maintaining a world built on propaganda is creating an enemy who is excluded from an in-group. Bouncing off of Nixon’s concept of traditional Americans, Fox has cultivated an image of its in-group (for its in-group) as people who love God, who love their families, and who love their country. Once the parameters of the in-group have been established, the process of othering begins. By exploiting pre-existing beliefs, images, and negative stereotypes, an out-group is formed. In the case of Fox, this out-group, again, aligns with Nixon’s definition of the “liberal elite”: people who challenge the oppression of the established power structure.","Once the enemy has been created, there’s no need to appeal to logic. In her fantastic book Enemy Images in War Propaganda, Marja Vuorinenexplains that humans tend to think of themselves and their in-groups as possessing all the qualities of good virtue (“honesty, righteousness, purity, proper manners, hard work, right religion”), and in an attempt to preserve that fragile self-image, humans project the opposite attributes (“evil, untruthful, cooked, lazy, superstitious, barbaric”) onto groups of people who are not like them. Fox is addictive not only because it feeds a specific ideology, but also because it provides daily reassurance that Fox viewers are God’s chosen Good Guys by reiterating that the “liberal elite” are the Bad Guys.","Projection/Flipping","Projection/flipping is simply falsely accusing someone else of the doing/being the thing you’re responsible for doing/being. These techniques are Fox News favorites. They are used in every step of Fox’s propaganda cycle, but they’re especially effective at creating enemies.","+ On a November 2012 episode of The O’Reilly Factor, notorious bully Bill O’Reilly lambasted dishonest media culture and “vicious” people from the far-left, saying: “There are entire media operations that exist solely to promote ideology; it’s obviously a bad situation that is getting worse.” He is describing himself and Fox news with alarming clarity, but accusing the “liberal media” of his crimes instead.","+ In May 2012, President Obama was asked on The Viewwhether or not he expected the presidential election to be close. He replied, “When your name is Barack Obama, it’s always tight.” President Obama was referring to the tactics conservative pundits have used paint him as a non-American with sympathies and ties to radical Middle Eastern terrorist groups. That afternoon, however, Fox News regular Monica Crowley called the president “bigoted” for suggesting many Americans view him through a racist lens. This is flipping in a nutshell: When a victim calls you out on your bigotry and your suggest that they are the bigot and you are the victim.","+ Glenn Beck — who has a long history of spewing racist rhetoric against black people, Muslims, and undocumented workers — accused President Obama of having “a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white culture.”","Character Assassination","Character assassination is a propaganda technique used to attack a person, rather than an idea, by discrediting, defaming, demonizing, or dehumanizing them. Fox News does not only use character assassination against liberal politicians and organizations; it also uses character assassination against innocent people involved in tragedies that could be catalysts for progressive changes, like greater equality for racial minorities or gun control. For example, Fox News has made it a common practice to create heroes out of the racist white men who kill innocent black teenagers.","+ When Trayvon Martin was murdered by George Zimmerman, Fox News guest Doug Burns said, “I know everybody keeps sarcastically saying about the Skittles. You could probably kill somebody with Skittles. The thing is, yeah, you’re spinning a lot of hypotheticals. And you could break a bottle of iced tea, right, with the jagged edge, and you could kill somebody with it.” Geraldo Rivera insisted that Martin’s “hoodie is as much responsible for [his] death as George Zimmerman was.” After which he continued to paint a menacing picture of the unarmed teenager and defend Zimmerman’s decision to kill him.","+ After Eric Garner was killed by New York City police who used an illegal chokehold on him, Fox News went to great lengths to blame his murder on Garner himself. The coroner’s report stated that Garner died of “compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.” However, Fox News sought commentary from pundits who blamed Garner’s other health issues for his death, believed Garner had it coming because he was selling cigarettes illegally, or denied that he was even placed in a chokehold at all.","+ After unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot multiple times by Officer Darren Wilson, Fox News hosts repeatedlyasserted that Brown was a “bad guy,” a narrative that included the perpetual presentation of false information.","+ When Freddie Gray was killed in the back of a police van in Baltimore, Fox News contributor Bo Dietel said, “I’m just hoping they did toxicology [on Gray]. Possibly he was on drugs.” When Geraldo Rivera arrived on the scene in Baltimore to cover the protests, he said residents seemed to be “looking for trouble.”","Scapegoating","Scapegoating is a propaganda technique used to place blame on an innocent group or individual to move blame away from the group or individual responsible for the problem, or to make sweeping generalizations about a group of people based on the actions of a few.","+ On The View in 2010, Bill O’Reilly said the reason he opposed a mosque being built near Ground Zero was because: “Muslims killed us on 9-11.”","+ The idea for an international cultural center in Manhattan was derided by Bill Hemmer as “the first stop for a radical jihadist who comes to America who wants to go pray.”","+ On The O’Reilly Factor, Ann Coulter said if all Muslims would boycott airlines we could dispense with airport security altogether.”","Appeal to Fear","“I have to pick on the ACLU because they’re the most dangerous organization in the United States of America right now. Theirs by far. There’s nobody even close to that. They’re, like, second next to Al Qaeda.” – Bill O’Reilly, June 2004","“Why has the Black Lives Matter movement not been classified yet as a hate group? I mean, how much more has to go in this direction before someone actually labels it as such?” – Elizabeth Hasselbeck, August 2015","Creating a climate of fear is essential to all propagandists, and Fox News is no exception. Fear is a primitive and often irrational emotion, so messages that appeal to fear bypass the brain’s logic center and land right in the hypothalamus, which controls a person’s fight-or-flight response. Like I mentioned above, Fox News’ out-group includes anyone who is not a straight white Christian, so it’s very easy for the network to exploit their viewers’ irrational fears of every minority group in America. The white victimization narrative is a cornerstone of Fox News’ (and Fox-adjacent talk radio hosts) programming. The idea they perpetuate is that the way of life treasured by hard-working, God-fearing, America-loving, family-first Conservatives is under constant threat by minority groups.","Media scholar/sociologist David L. Altheide’s book, Creating Fear: News and the Construction of Crisis, points out that “the poor, dispossessed, and most recently franchised segments of society are disproportionately associated with the largest fear application.”","The people who consume Fox News’ messages do so in a state of perpetual state of fear; reason is replaced by anxiety, and the ability to think logically is lost.","Minority-Baiting/Coded Language","Minority-baiting is a propaganda technique used to prey on fear that is based in otherness. Fox News accomplishes this by reaffirming the bigoted, ignorant beliefs their viewers have ingested throughout the course of their lives from TV, movies, books, advertising, political campaigns, and American foreign policy propaganda; then, they create a false narrative in which the stereotyped minority is threatening the American way of life.","In Ian Haney López’s masterwork on the language of race, Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class, he describes coded language as words or phrases that “trigger racial anxiety and allow plausible deniability by crafting language that lets the speaker deny that he’s even thinking about race.” One of Fox News’ most successful and despicable propaganda tactics is perpetually suggesting that people who talk about race are the real racists, while methodically weaving coded racial messages into their programming. Here are just a few examples:","+ When Fox News talks about “State Rights,” they’re invoking the language used as a coded racial appeal during the Civil Rights Movement that gave states the right to ignore federally mandated racial integration.","+ The phrase “illegal alien” triggers fears about immigrants being criminals who want to undermine the American way of life.","+ Phrases like “Defender of marriage” or “defender of faith” are used to position advocates of LGBT equality as people determined to destroy marriage or destroy faith.","+ Words like “thug,” “ghetto,” and “hood” are used to other black people and their cultural expressions while drawing to mind violent images from pop culture.","Stereotyping","Stereotyping is a propaganda technique in which pre-existing ideas about a racial, ethnic, or cultural group are exaggerated and used to make generalizations that usually perpetuate discrimination and inequality. Fox News stereotypes by using coded language, yes, but they also stereotype by presenting “dramatic anecdotes in place of scientific evidence, promoting isolated events as trends, [and] depicting categories of people as dangerous.”","+ When Fox News talks about “welfare” and “food stamps,” they do so with the unspoken suggestion that these programs are about lazy minorities taking wealth from hard-working white people. Same with “entitlement society.”","+ The phrase “black-on-black crime” suggests that black people are inherently criminal, and that all violent actions taken against them are justified because white people are defending themselves/their family against someone who is, or likely will be, a criminal.","+ Following O’Reilly’s The View appearance during which he said “Muslims killed us on 9-11,” Brian Kilmeade defended him on Fox & Friends by saying: “Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.”","Create Alternate Reality","“By the way, who ended slavery and Jim Crow? Christians. The Rev. Martin Luther King. Christians. Christianity is the reason we don’t have slavery in the world today.” – Tucker Carlson, February 2015","Misinformation","Misinformation is simply spreading false information that is intended to deceive. Fox News constantly, purposefully misinforms its viewers. I’m going to list a handful of examples below with an annotation about which of the aforementioned propaganda techniques the misinformation is used to play into. There are entirewebsites dedicated to correcting Fox News’ lies on a daily basis. Remember that Fox News viewers overwhelmingly accept these lies as irrefutable facts.","+ In March 2010, Fox & Friends co-anchor Gretchen Carlson said the Texas Board of Education is was considering new history textbooks that would “eliminate references to certain holidays, Founding Fathers, the Constitution! I mean, no surprise that Christmas, they want to get rid of that because they’ve been doing that for the last couple of years, but c’mon, the Constitution?” Untrue. (Isolate viewers: ad nauseam, cognitive dissonance.)","+ In January 2014, on Fox & Friends, Brian Kilmeade said Colorado welfare recipients can turn their benefits into cash at ATMS, which they will do to buy marijuana. Untrue. (Appeal to fear: minority-baiting, coded language, stereotyping.)","+ In April 2014 Todd Starnes said that liberals had figured out a Facebook algorithm and “all the people getting banned from Facebook are somehow conservatives.” Untrue. (Isolate viewers: false dichotomies, ad nauseam. Create an enemy: character assassination.)","+ In February The Five co-host Dana Perions said about climate change: “The temperature readings have been fabricated, and it’s all blowing up in their (scientists’) faces.” On the same panel, Kimberly Guilfoyle called climate change research “fraud science.” Obviously untrue. (Just pure misinformation, as are 72% of Fox News claims about climate change.)","+ In September 2014, Britt Hume said that President Obama was sending a much larger force to deal with Ebola in West African countries than with ISIS. Super untrue. (Appeal to fear: minority-baiting, coded language.)","+ And let’s not forget Birtherism. In 2013, 64 percent of Republicans still believed President Obama was not born in the United States. (Appeal to fear: minority-baiting, coded language, stereotyping.)","Confuse","The propaganda technique of purposefully confusing people is different than misinforming. Instead of presenting outright lies as facts, confusion is implemented by presenting deliberately vague generalities so the audience can fill in the blank with the messages they’ve already received about people who have already been othered. It’s talking around an idea with willful ambiguousness for the purpose of obscuring facts.","+ Looking at the way Fox News and its viewers bumbled around in various states of bewilderment after the 2012 election is the perfect way to illustrate that point. In the build-up to election day, the math that lead multiple long-respected, nonpartisan polling organizations to forecast a win for President Obama was condemned by Fox News as “scientific gobbledygook,” “liberal media noise,” and “numbers that parrot the mainstream media.”","Rewrite History","Rewriting history is simply lying about events that have already happened. It’s a type of misinformation in which the propagandists’ current opinions are justified by presenting an inaccurate view of the past.","+ After the 2012 presidential election, Fox News blamed President Obama’s campaign for many of the public perceptions about Mitt Romney that led to his defeat. However, it was Republican candidates who crafted those messages during the primary campaign season. Fox told its viewers President Obama was responsible for Americans believing the narrative that Romney “was a vulture, that he was a vampire,” a “Vulture Capitalist.” In fact, it was Rick Perry who coined the phrase and Newt Gingrich who continued to promote it. Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire who ultimately became one of Romney’s chief financial supporters, is the one who financed Gingrich’s now-infamous “King of Bain” attack documentary.","+ In an attempt to paint President Obama as soft on terrorism, Eric Bolling, co-host of the Fox News program The Five,said there were no terrorist attacks in America during President Bush’s time as president: “America was certainly safe between 2000 and 2008. I don’t remember any terrorist attacks on American soil during that period of time.” Not a single person on the panel pointed out that Bolling had either forgotten or was deliberately excluding 9/11, the most devastating terrorist attack in United States history. When Bolling was called out by basically every non-Fox new organization in the country, he said that he misspoke, but that the “radical liberal left” was “being petty” for expressing outrage over his lie.","+ In January 2013, Sean Hannity told Fox News viewers that there were 8.3 million fewer Americans working than when President Bush left office in 2008, which was completely untrue.","What kind of effects do we see when large numbers of people are consuming baseless propaganda under the impression that it’s news journalism? Well, a study conducted by Cambridge’s Journal of Politics found that all Americans — not just evangelical Christians or diehard Republicans — are susceptible to Fox News’ message. Democratic members of Congress became more sympathetic to Republican causes after being exposed to Fox News. Their hostility toward Mexican immigration increased, for example, as did their belief in inaccuracies about climate change and the Iraq war. Fox News deliberately misinforms its viewers about things like climate change to score political capital, and most scientists now believe the earth is on the brink of its sixth mass extinction. Fox News not only fosters a culture of terror and hate; it also purposefully contributes to the destruction of the literal planet.","Though Fox News will deny it, one of the reasons Donald Trump has been so successful in Republican Primary polls is that he’s explicitly saying what Fox News has been using coded messages to say for the last decade. Fox has convinced their viewership that brown people are inherently criminal, and black people are inherently lazy, and gay people are in opposition to God, and women don’t deserve the same rights as men or control over their own bodies. It’s not surprising that when Trump bluntly gives voice to these opinions, many Republicans — the majority of whom consume Fox News at least weekly — support him. He is doing nothing more than parroting the message of Fox News with more directness. When two white dudes attack a homeless Latino man and pee on him, citing Donald Trump as their inspiration, that is a direct effect of Fox News propaganda cycle.","My goal with this article isn’t to ridicule people who watch Fox News; my goal is to to make plain this deliberate, manipulative cycle Fox traps its viewers inside, so we can use our knowledge to begin to set our friends and family free.","Armed with these truths, maybe we won’t all feel so helpless during this election season."],"isopubdate":"2015-09-02"}

People buy other risky or illegal substances on the dark web, including drugs, pirated content like movies or music and materials that help with scams, including credit-card “skimmers.”","Facebook logins can be sold for $5.20 each because they allow criminals to have access to personal data that could potentially let them hack into more of an individual’s accounts. The credentials to a PayPal\nPYPL, +1.17%\naccount with a relatively high balance can be sold on the dark web for $247 on average, the report found.","One’s entire online identity, including personal identification numbers and hacked financial accounts, can be sold for only about $1,200 on the dark web, Fractl found.","That’s because so much personal information may already available to hackers, after repeated data breaches across a range of industries. It comes down to supply and demand, said Adam Levin, the founder of the security firm CyberScout and the author of “Swiped.” Hackers want to grab personal information and sell it as fast as they can, so they can move on, he said.","“With 5.3 billion records released due to accidents and 2.6 billion records released due to hacking last year, personal information is becoming cheap,” said Rick McElroy, a security strategist at the security firm Carbon Black.","Wealthier individuals are more valuable to criminals, and those without money are worth less, said Al Pascual, a senior vice president and research director at the security firm Javelin. But the more information hackers have, the more valuable the data.","“A college student with not a lot of money in the bank might be worth $50,” Pascual said. “If you’re near retirement, with a fat retirement account and plenty of money in the bank, you’ll be worth more.”","Voter data are also vulnerable and valuable during election season, Pascual said. There are more attempts to compromise voter records in the run-up to elections, including attacks against registrars’ offices. Electronic voting machines can also be compromised, he said.","Type of account","Average price log-in goes for on dark web","PayPal","$247","Costco","$5","ASOS (clothing)","$2","Airbnb","$8","Uber","$7","T-Mobile","$10.51","DHL","$10.40","Facebook","$5.20","Gmail","$1","Grubhub","$9","Logins for food delivery websites such as Grubhub can be sold for about $9 because they allow criminals to fraudulently order expensive food and alcohol.","And a login for the lodging site Airbnb can be sold for about $8 because it opens up “a world of scams,” Fractl said. Fraudsters have changed hosts’ payment details to steal their earnings, or have been able to assume the identities of well-reviewed guests in order to book their own stays. Airbnb has updated its security measures in the last year to combat fraud.","Consumers should always use two-factor authentication when possible, such as a password and a security question or a biometric login like a fingerprint, Pascual said. Amazon often asks consumers to re-enter their payment information when they are asking to ship to an unfamiliar address, he said.","Pascual also recommended signing up for security alerts on every account that offers them, so consumers can keep track of transactions as they’re made in real time. “For better or worse, individuals have to be their own advocates for the security of their identity,” he said.","Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","See the full visual","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick Guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","See the full visual","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Two Facebook employees were named as co-authors of the study, alongside researchers from Cambridge, Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley. Kogan was publishing under the name Aleksandr Spectre at the time.","A University of Cambridge press release on the study’s publication noted that the paper was “the first output of ongoing research collaborations between Spectre’s lab in Cambridge and Facebook”. Facebook did not respond to queries about whether any other collaborations occurred.","“The sheer volume of the 57bn friend pairs implies a pre-existing relationship,” said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “It’s not common for Facebook to share that kind of data. It suggests a trusted partnership between Aleksandr Kogan/Spectre and Facebook.”","Facebook downplayed the significance of the dataset, which it said was shared with Kogan in 2013. “The data that was shared was literally numbers – numbers of how many friendships were made between pairs of countries – ie x number of friendships made between the US and UK,” Facebook spokeswoman Christine Chen said by email. “There was no personally identifiable information included in this data.”","Facebook’s relationship with Kogan has since soured.","“We ended our working relationship with Kogan altogether after we learned that he violated Facebook’s terms of service for his unrelated work as a Facebook app developer,” Chen said. Facebook has said that it learned of Kogan’s misuse of the data in December 2015, when the Guardian first reported that the data had been obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","“We started to take steps to end the relationship right after the Guardian report, and after investigation we ended the relationship soon after, in 2016,” Chen said.","On Tuesday, Facebook went further, saying in a statement: “The entire company is outraged we were deceived.” And on Wednesday, in his first public statement on the scandal, its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called Kogan’s actions a “breach of trust”.","But Facebook has not explained how it came to have such a close relationship with Kogan that it was co-authoring research papers with him, nor why it took until this week – more than two years after the Guardian initially reported on Kogan’s data harvesting activities – for it to inform the users whose personal information was improperly shared.","And Kogan has offered a defence of his actions in an interview with the BBC and an email to his Cambridge colleagues obtained by the Guardian. “My view is that I’m being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Kogan said on Radio 4 on Wednesday.","The data collection that resulted in Kogan’s suspension by Facebook was undertaken by Global Science Research (GSR), a company he founded in May 2014 with another Cambridge researcher, Joseph Chancellor. Chancellor is currently employed by Facebook.","Between June and August of that year, GSR paid approximately 270,000 individuals to use a Facebook questionnaire app that harvested data from their own Facebook profiles, as well as from their friends, resulting in a dataset of more than 50 million users. The data was subsequently given to Cambridge Analytica, in what Facebook has said was a violation of Kogan’s agreement to use the data solely for academic purposes.","In his email to colleagues at Cambridge, Kogan said that he had created the Facebook app in 2013 for academic purposes, and used it for “a number of studies”. After he founded GSR, Kogan wrote, he transferred the app to the company and changed its name, logo, description, and terms and conditions. CNN first reported on the Cambridge email. Kogan did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on this article.","“We made clear the app was for commercial use – we never mentioned academic research nor the University of Cambridge,” Kogan wrote. “We clearly stated that the users were granting us the right to use the data in broad scope, including selling and licensing the data. These changes were all made on the Facebook app platform and thus they had full ability to review the nature of the app and raise issues. Facebook at no point raised any concerns at all about any of these changes.”","Kogan is not alone in criticising Facebook’s apparent efforts to place the blame on him.","“In my view, it’s Facebook that did most of the sharing,” said Albright, who questioned why Facebook created a system for third parties to access so much personal information in the first place. That system “was designed to share their users’ data in meaningful ways in exchange for stock value”, he added.","Whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Observer that Facebook was aware of the volume of data being pulled by Kogan’s app. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use,” Wylie said. “So they were like: ‘Fine.’”","In the Cambridge email, Kogan characterised this claim as a “fabrication”, writing: “There was no exchange with Facebook about it, and ... we never claimed during the project that it was for academic research. In fact, we did our absolute best not to have the project have any entanglements with the university.”","The collaboration between Kogan and Facebook researchers which resulted in the report published in 2015 also used data harvested by a Facebook app. The study analysed two datasets, the anonymous macro-level national set of 57bn friend pairs provided by Facebook and a smaller dataset collected by the Cambridge academics.","'They were given an inch and took 100 miles': readers on Cambridge Analytica, Facebook and privacy","Read more","For the smaller dataset, the research team used the same method of paying people to use a Facebook app that harvested data about the individuals and their friends.

The study notes that the users signed a consent form about the research and that “no deception was used”.","The paper was published in late August 2015. In September 2015, Chancellor left GSR, according to company records.

(Image: Sinclair Broadcast Group)","WASHINGTON (SBG) —","A number of Facebook users are changing their status with the social media giant from \"It's Complicated\" to \"Separated\" after learning the company mishandled user data and shared it with third-party developers.","For any public company, trust is its currency. The latest revelations of a massive user privacy breach at Facebook have raised new questions about whether the company can and should be trusted to responsibly manage the personal data of its more than 2.1 billion users.","#DeleteFacebook began trending last week after reports that Facebook allowed the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access the personal data of as many as 50 million users. According to admissions by Cambridge Analytica, the data was used to develop psychographic profiles to help political campaigns target voters.","In the aftermath of these revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a charm offensive, speaking with reporters, apologizing for mishandling user data and promising to do better in the future.","On Sunday, Zuckerberg took out a full-page ad in multiple U.S. newspapers that read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't we don't deserve it.\"","The ad referred to the Cambridge Analytica operation and the actions of a \"university researcher,\" Aleksandr Kogan, who developed a quiz app in 2014 on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Under Facebook's policy at the time, Kogan was able to pay for a feature called \"friends permission.\" That allowed him to harvest the data of 270,000 quiz-takers, who gave explicit consent to use their data, as well as the data that could be gleaned from their friend networks.","In his ad, Zuckerberg admitted that Kogan's app was not the only one that trawled large amounts of user information. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" Zuckerberg said. He concluded, \"Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\"","Some have taken note of the CEO's apology and applauded the company for taking steps to make its data-sharing policies more transparent. Zuckerberg and other executives at Facebook have published notices explaining steps they're taking to crack down on platform abuses as well as their efforts to make privacy settings more user-friendly.","Others have pointed to the fact that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user data.","\"Facebook says we don't sell your data, but they certainly provide access to it,\" observed Michelle De Mooy, director of the privacy and data project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.","Moreover, Facebook acknowledged that it knew about Cambridge Analytica's questionable contract with Kogan in 2015. At that time, they suspended Kogan and asked him to confirm that he had deleted the user data. According to reports, that user data remained accessible to Cambridge Analytica for years.","\"Facebook has been dragged, seemingly kicking and screaming into being more transparent,\" said Dave Levine, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \"Facebook has not done nearly as much as it could, simply by way of explanation to the public about its behaviors, about how your information or posts are curated, about what kind of data it collects and how it shares it.\"","The Cambridge Analytica breach is only the latest example of the company's opacity and delayed response to public outcry. Facebook has been at the center of the fake news controversy and spreading misinformation during the 2016 election. The company has been called before Congress over their role in facilitating Russian election interference and online terrorist recruitment. And the company finally acknowledged and changed their newsfeed policy after being caught suppressing conservative content.","Each scandal has temporarily hurt Facebook, but the latest scandal over violating users' privacy could be the one that tips the scales and imposes real costs and consequences on the social media giant.","\"Ultimately the problem here is one of trust,\" explained Julian Sanchez, privacy and technology fellow at the Cato Institute. If users no longer believe the company is responsibly handling their information or feel they cannot understand the company's policies for sharing their data, Zuckerberg's apologies will be \"too little, too late,\" Sanchez noted.","\"Once that's burned, once people don't have a sense of trust, I don't know if the specific policy changes will help much,\" he continued. \"Even if they really are making genuine improvements, as it appears they are, once that trust is gone, it's hard to get back.\"","In a new poll conducted in the days after the data sharing scandal erupted, Reuters/Ipsos found that the majority of respondents do not trust Facebook to handle their data.","Facebook was deemed the least trustworthy when it came to obeying laws that protect American's personal information when compared to other companies that gather user data like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo.","\"Maybe the poll is new, but the sentiment is not,\" De Mooy explained. The reason, she said, is that social media platforms \"are designed for opacity,\" intentionally making it harder for users to understand and make informed decisions about their data.","Facebook and other companies that rely on selling access to user data have had to walk a thin line between protecting their users' data and monetizing it. Consistently over recent years, polls have shown that even as users sign up and sign away some of the rights to their data, they are wary of how that information is being used.","Periodically, this concern has translated into relatively short-lived calls for people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, but it is not clear that those efforts have caused the company to fundamentally change how it operates.","\"If a few hundred-thousand people delete their Facebook accounts that will have a marginal impact on their bottom line,\" Levine noted. \"However if there is a reputational hit at the trust level, which is what Facebook needs to maintain in order to be a viable business, that cumulatively could create problems.\"","In recent weeks, Facebook has taken a significant hit with the markets valuing the breach of privacy and trust in the tens of billions. Since the story broke earlier this month, Facebook's stock has plunged more than 15 percent in a selling spree that has cost the company over $75 billion in market value.","Facebook could also be facing even more costs as the consumer protection watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy and data use policies based on the reports about the company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","The FTC already brought charges against Facebook in 2011 for what it termed \"deceptive privacy claims.\" At the time, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC and signed a consent decree which, among other things, required the company to obtain a user's explicit consent before allowing third parties to access their data. Moreover, the agreement required Facebook to inform users if they discovered they were unable to protect their data.","\"Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here,\" former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Jessica Rich told the Washington Post last week. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties.\"","If the FTC finds Facebook in violation of the consent decree, the company could face a $40,000 fine per violation. It is not clear whether that fine would apply to the alleged 50 million users whose data was shared inappropriately with Cambridge Analytica. In a statement to the Post, a Facebook spokesperson said the company rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","De Mooy said she is encouraged by the FTC investigation, emphasizing that \"the consent decrees need to be meaningful.\" However, she worries that regulators simply lack the enforcement authority when it comes to protecting consumer data.","In the United States, consumer data is largely governed by contracts and terms of use agreements between the consumer and the company. This approach is vastly different from the European Union, which will be implementing a new regime of privacy protections, the General Data Protection Regulation, beginning in May.","The new privacy regime will directly impact U.S. tech companies that will be required to be more transparent in informing consumers about their sharing practices in order to get consent. Companies that fail to protect user data can also expect to see millions of dollars in fines.","It is yet to be seen whether U.S. lawmakers, who have traditionally taken a lax approach to regulating internet companies, will take steps to strengthen data privacy protections."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Now, that data is collected and leveraged by bad actors in an attempt to manipulate you and your friends.","The time for ignorance is over. We need social responsibility to counterbalance a bad product. The public learned in alarming detail this weekend how a Trump-aligned firm called Cambridge Analytica managed to collect data on 50 million people using Facebook. All, as the Guardian put it, to \"predict and influence choices at the ballot box.\" Individuals who opted into Cambridge Analytica's service — which was disguised as a personality quiz on Facebook — made their friends vulnerable to this manipulation, as well.","There were better days on the social network. When you signed up for Facebook, it's likely because it was an alluring way for you to connect with old friends and share pictures. You hadn't ever imagined \"Russian trolls\" or \"fake news\" or, lord knows, \"Cambridge Analytica.\" Chances are, you signed up before 2016, when Wired recently declared the social network had begun \"two years of hell,\" thanks in no small part to reporting efforts from current Mashable staffer Michael Nuñez.","By then, the vast majority of Facebook's 239 million monthly users in America had registered, had likely built an entire virtual life of friends and photos and status updates that were primed to be harvested by forces they couldn't yet see or understand. Unlike those who continued smoking after the Marlboro Man arrived (two years after a seminal 1952 article in Reader's Digest explained the dangers of cigarettes to the broad American public), these Facebook users lit up before they knew the cancer was coming.","Running with a health metaphor, Wired's \"two years of hell\" feature was promoted with a photo illustration by Jake Rowland that depicted a bloodied and bruised Mark Zuckerberg:","Image: photo illustration by jake rowland/esto. courtesy conde nast.","Zuckerberg may have been assaulted from all sides, but we — his users — took more of a licking than he did.","That's because Facebook's past two years have been all about ethical and technological crises that hurt users most of all.

Human life is incidental.","Facebook's problems extend forever out of the idea that we are all different clumps of data generation","The photos you post are interpreted by Facebook's programs to automatically recognize your face; the interests you communicate via text are collated and cross-examined by algorithms to serve you advertising. Our virtual social connections enrich this marketing web and make advertisers more powerful.","And many of us open the app to scroll without really knowing why. Facebook literally presents us with a \"feed.\" We are users the way drug addicts are users, and we're used like a focus group is used to vet shades of red in a new can of Coca-Cola.","None of this has been secret for some time. Braver, more fed up, or perhaps more responsible users have deactivated their Facebook accounts before. But any change they made was on the basis of their experience as individuals. New revelations demand we think more in terms of our online societies.","I have exactly 1,000 Facebook friends, and about 10 actual, best friends I see on a regular basis.

But recent revelations that a firm called Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal information of 50 million unwitting Facebook users in 2015 has created new sense of urgency for those hoping for some modicum of control over their online life. If you ever needed a wake-up call, this is it.","The good news: Despite the repeated, public privacy lapses, Facebook does offer a fairly robust set of tools to control who knows what about you—both on the platform and around the web. The bad news: Facebook doesn't always make those settings easy to find, and they may not all offer the level of protection you want.","Fear not! Below, we'll walk you through the steps you need to take to keep advertisers, third-party apps, strangers, and Facebook itself at bay. And if after all that you still feel overly exposed? We'll show you how to walk away entirely.","Keep Apps in Check","Over the years you've used Facebook, you've probably given various apps permission to tap into its data trove. And why not? At the time it's a simple enough request, a way to share photos more easily, or find friends across the app diaspora.","In doing so, though, you're granting developers deep insight into your Facebook profile. And until Facebook tightened up permissions in 2015, you were also potentially letting them see information about your friends, as well; Cambridge Analytica scored all that data not from a hack, but because the developer of a legitimate quiz app passed it to them.","So! Time to audit which apps you've let creep on your Facebook account, and give the boot to any that don't have a very good reason for being there. That's most of them.","On a desktop—you can do this on mobile as well, but it's more streamlined on a computer—head to the downward-facing arrow in the upper-right corner of your screen, and click Privacy. (You're going to spend a lot of time here today.) Now go to Apps, and gaze upon what your wanton permissions-granting hath wrought.","On this page, you can see a list of apps with access to your Facebook profile information.","OK, so maybe it's not that bad. Or maybe it is! I have friends who discovered well over a dozen apps lurking within the Logged in with Facebook pane; I only have four, but that's because I did some spring cleaning recently. Either way, you can see not only what apps are there, but how much info they're privy to. For instance: I haven't used IFTTT in years, but for some reason it has access to my Friend list, my timeline, my work history, and my birthday.","To revoke any of those permissions, go over and click the pencil. To scrap the app altogether, hit the X. You'll get a pop-up asking if you're sure. Yes, you're sure. Click Remove to make it official.","An important note here: Those developers still have whatever data about you that they've collected up to this point. You have to contact them directly to ask them to delete it, and they're under no obligation to do so. To at least make the attempt, find the app on Facebook and send them a message. If they ask for your User ID, you can find that back on the Apps page by clicking on the app in question and scrolling all the way down.","It feels like you should be done now, but you're not. From that same Apps page, go down just a smidge further to Apps, Websites, and Plugins. If you don't want Facebook bleeding into any other part of your online experience—that's games, user profiles, apps, you name it—then click Disable Platform. This could have unintended consequences, especially if you've used Facebook to login to other sites! Only one way to find out, though.","And then scroll down just one more teensy bit to Apps Others Use, where you'll see about a dozen bits of information about you, like your birthday, or if you're online, that your friends might unwittingly be sharing with apps and websites. Uncheck anything you don't want out there in the world, which is honestly probably all of it. (UPDATE: As it turns out, this setting doesn't actually do anything, and hasn't for years. Facebook somehow never got around to changing it.)","OK, now you're done. With apps. There's still a lot left, though.","Bad Ads","Back to the Settings panel! This time head to Ads, which you'll find right below Apps. (The fact that neither of these falls under Security or Privacy should tell you all you need to know about Facebook's disposition here.)","Just to be clear, Facebook—along with Google, and tons of faceless ad networks—tracks your every move online, even if you don't have an account. That's the internet we're stuck with for now, and no amount of settings tweaks can fix it. What you can do, though, is take a modicum of control over what Facebook does with that information.","That pair of shoes that haunts your News Feed, even though you already bought a similar pair? Exorcise them by turning off Ads based on my use of websites and apps.","\"Online interest-based ads\" are advertisements that rely on access to your browsing activity.","Also say no to Ads on apps and websites off the Facebook companies, which covers all the non-Facebook parts internet where the company serves up ads—which is pretty much everywhere. Then head straight down the line to Ads with your social actions, which you should only leave on in the event you want to share with the world that you accidentally clicked Like on that sponsored post from a furniture company that probably exists only on a server in Luxembourg.","And for some fun insight into what Facebook thinks you're into, click on Your Interests. There you'll find the categories that Facebook uses to tailor ads to your Liking. You can clear out any that bother you by clicking the X in the upper-righthand corner when you hover over, but mostly it's a fun lesson in how digital advertisers distill your essence. You'll also likely find at least one surprise; Facebook thinks I'm into IndyCar, which honestly, maybe, if I'd only give it a chance.","Please remember that none of this will in any way change the number of ads you see on Facebook or around the web. For that, you'll need an ad blocker.","Friends Focus","After a decade on Facebook, you've likely picked up friends along the way you no longer recognize—not just their profile picture, their name and context. Who are all these people? Why are they Liking my baby pics? Why aren't they liking my baby pics?","To get a handle on who can see which of your posts, it's finally time to head to Settings then Privacy.","Start with Who can see my posts, then click on Who can see my future posts to manage your defaults. You've got options! You can go full-on public and share with the world, or limit your circle by geography, employers, schools, groups, you name it. Whatever you pick will be your default from here on out.","Whatever you pick, immediately go to Limit the audience for posts you've shared with friends of friends or public? to make that choice retroactive. In other words, if you had a public account until now, changing your settings won't automatically make your past posts private. You have to get in a few extra clicks for that.","Not everyone you know needs to see everything you do.","Skip ahead down to How People Find and Contact You, since that's thankfully pretty straightforward. Tweak all the settings to your liking. The main note here: Don't share your email or phone number unless you absolutely have to, and if you do, keep the circle as small as possible. (If you do have to share one or the other with Facebook for account purposes, you can hide them by going to your profile page, clicking Contact and Basic Info, then Edit when you mouse over the email field. From there, click on the downward arrow with two silhouettes to customize who can see it, including no one but you.)","And while we're almost done with this part, first we have to talk about tagging. If people want to tag you on Facebook, there's not much you can do about it. Sorry! But you can at least stop those embarrassing pics from showing up in your timeline. Enable the option to Review posts you're tagged in before the post appears on your timeline so you can clear anything out that you'd rather not see there.","Then, head to Timeline and Tagging in the left-hand menu. There you can limit who can post to your timeline, who can see which posts, who can see what you're tagged in, and so on. Your tolerance here will vary depending on how active a Facebook user you are and how obnoxious your friends can be, but at the very least it's helpful for setting custom audiences that exclude people—your boss, maybe, or an ex—you definitely don't want taking an active role in your Facebook experience.","To test out those changes, head to Review what other people see on your timeline, where you can see what your account looks like through the eyes of a set of people or a specific friend.","One last thing: You'll see a Face Recognition option in the left-hand menu pane as well. It has some genuine uses, like letting you know if someone is using a photo of you in their account for trolling or impersonation. But if you're fundamentally more creeped out by Facebook's algorithms hunting for your face than by potential human jerks, go ahead and switch it off.","What About Russians?","While it still sounds like the subplot to a lesser Die Hard installment, dozens of Russian propagandists really did infiltrate Facebook a few years ago. Did you follow or like one of their accounts? Find out for sure here, assuming Facebook doesn't once again upwardly revise the number. And then find a way to get that link in front of your aunt. You know which one I mean.","Is Facebook Listening To Everything I Say?","By this point, it's a trope: You have a casual conversation about umbrellas with your roommate—as one does—and a few hours later, umbrella ads flood your News Feed. Surely this means Facebook's using your smartphone's mic to eavesdrop, right?","Well, no, sorry! As we've explained here and others have investigated elsewhere, Facebook's not actually hijacking your microphone. For starters, it would be wildly impractical not only to sort through all that data, but to figure out which words meant anything.","Besides, worrying about Facebook eavesdropping distracts from the far more concerning fact that it doesn't have to. The things you and your friends do online, and where you do them, and when, and how, and from what locations, all form more than enough of a profile to inform ads that feel like Facebook isn't just listening in on your conversations, but on your private thoughts. So, please do feel better about the mic thing, but much, much worse about the state of internet tracking, targeting, and advertising at large.","Going Nuclear","If even scrolling through all of these settings tweaks has left you exhausted, much less actually implementing them, you do have a more efficient option: pulling the plug altogether.","Before you do this: First, do recognize that this won't solve all of your online ad woes. You'll still be tracked, targeted, and so on across the web, both by Facebook and other ad networks. They'll all have that much less info to work with, though! So that's something.","And second, if you do decide to go through with it, think about downloading your account first. There's no reason to lose all those photos and statuses and such. To preserve those memories offline, head to Settings > General Account Settings > Download a copy of your Facebook data and click Start my archive. Facebook will email you with a download link when it's ready, which you should pounce on since it'll expire eventually.","OK all set? Here we go. Head back to Settings again, where you'll start in General. Click on Manage Account, scroll past the grim \"what happens to my social media presence when I die\" bits, and click Deactivate my account. You'll need to enter your password here, look at photos of friends who will \"miss\" you, take a quick survey about why you're bailing, and then click Deactivate one more time.","There are several steps to deleting your account. Be sure to complete all of them.","Please note that you have not yet actually deleted your account! You've just put it in hibernation, in case you ever decide to come back. For full-on deletion—which means if you do decide to go back you'll have to start from scratch—head to this link right here. That'll put you just a password entry and a CAPTCHA away from freedom. There's a delay of a few days though, and if you sign back on in the interim, Facebook will go ahead and cancel that deletion request. So stick to your guns, don't log in, and maybe delete the Facebook app from your phone just in case.","And that's it! You're clear, at least until Facebook changes its privacy options once again. Whether you decide to stay or leave, the important thing is to take as much control over how your data gets used as possible. Sometimes that's still not a lot—but it's something."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

By age 12, more than half of all children have a social media profile.[2] This rises to 96%[3] of 16-24 year olds having a social media account.\nMedia reports in the past week estimate that 50 million Facebook users had their personal data exploited by the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica. Thousands of children and young people are likely to be part of this figure.","This is fundamentally inconsistent with the 5Rights framework[4], which highlights children’s five key rights in relation to technology, including the right to be informed.","Young people have previously articulated concerns about data being gathered without their informed consent, for example through unclear data gathering terms and conditions.","Children in Scotland’s Head of Policy Amy Woodhouse said:","“This breach represents a worrying step outside already unclear terms and we are concerned that it is part of a pattern.

All companies and organisations should have rigorous processes and be fully transparent in what data they are gathering, why, and what purposes it may be used for.","“We welcome the Information Commissioner’s ongoing investigation into data analytics for political purposes[8], and believe that children and young people’s rights must be a core consideration of this investigation.”"],"isopubdate":""}

While pursuing an internship in Doha at the Qatar Computer Research Institute (QCRI) at Hamad Bin Khalifa University, he examined the potential use of Facebook’s advertising audience estimates as a data source to shed new light on the digital gender gap worldwide.","This data is essential to global aid organizations tracking internet and mobile phone use by gender. Improving women’s digital access has been recognized by aid groups as a critical development goal. But monitoring progress toward that goal has been challenging due to a lack of gender-disaggregated data, especially in low-income countries. Facebook’s Ads Manager provides a real-time source of information that can be used to measure digital gender gaps in areas where data is scarce or non-existent, Fatehkia said.","Masoomali Fatehkia spent the summer of 2017 interning in Doha at the Qatar Computer Research Institute (QCRI) at Hamad Bin Khalifa University, where he used Facebook's advertising audience estimates as a data source to shed new light on the digital gender gap worldwide.","Photo courtesy of Masoomali Fatehkia","Fatehkia’s findings have been published in the journal World Development. His paper, “Using Facebook Ad Data to Track the Global Digital Gender Gap,” is co-authored with his mentors and collaborators, Ingmar Weber, QCRI’s research director for social computing, and Ridhi Kashyap, associate professor of social demography at the University of Oxford and professorial fellow at Nuffield College.","Fatehkia, who is from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, developed the internship opportunity with QCRI on his own initiative when researching summer opportunities focused on applying data science for the social good. “They [QCRI] were working on areas I was interested in,” Fatehkia said. “[Ingmar] does research in the area of social computing to explore migration and social gaps.”","Princeton’s International Internship Program (IIP) supports internships like Fatehkia’s. Of the 1,000 applications IIP receives each year, it funds approximately 250 summer internships, about 20 of which are student-initiated, said Luisa Duarte-Silva, IIP’s director.","“We encourage our students who take the initiative of creating their own internship to get in touch with alumni oversees and with professors here at the University,” she said. “Once they have made contact, we encourage them to vet the organization they are working with through several channels, including the American Embassy. They are required to show us all their correspondence with their future mentor, and to have negotiated work responsibilities that will challenge them in skills they already have or teach them new skills.”","In researching QCRI, Fatehkia discovered that 2009 Princeton alumnus Kenton Murray had held an internship there, and he was helpful in providing guidance. Murray also forwarded Fatehkia's resume to Weber.","When Fatehkia arrived in Qatar, Weber and Kashyap were completing a proposal for Data2X’s Big Data for Gender Challenge. Their idea was based on a UNESCO Broadband Commission for Digital Development goal of reaching gender equality in access to broadband by 2020.","“Masoomali showed excellent initiative right from the start,” Kashyap said. “Once we introduced the general motivation for the project and the different data sources to him, he took the lead on the data development and analysis for the research presented in the World Development journal article. He also actively commented on and contributed to the broader Data2X Big Data for Gender Challenge grant proposal that I was writing, which was Ingmar’s and my original motivation for delving into this line of research.”","Fatehkia spent 12 weeks in Qatar working with Weber using Facebook’s Ads Manager as well as custom software Weber had created to automate the capture of gender-related data. Kashyap joined them regularly by Skype.","Previously, the International Telecommunications Union, the United Nations’ specialized organization for communications and information technology, had statistics on gender digital access for 84 countries. Using the Facebook data, Fatehkia and his mentors expanded that to 152 countries. They made the biggest gains in adding low- and lower-middle-income countries to the data.","“Masoomali did an outstanding job in collecting and analyzing the data, as well as in writing up the findings,” Weber said. “Thanks to his efficiency and focus, we could even iterate a couple of times to improve the analysis methods.”","“This study presents a case of a low-cost data innovation to help monitor — or ‘nowcast’ — an important development indicator related to gender inequality that is a part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals,” Kashyap said. “The idea of nowcasting is to generate real-time predictions or measures based on data that are real-time, [and that are] much more frequently available and updated compared with conventional social science data sources (e.g., field surveys).”","“I think of data science as a toolkit to enable decision makers from various domains to make more informed decisions that are backed up by evidence and data,” Fatehkia said. “Using data science for social good is a unique combination that enables me to combine my strengths and interests in the various disciplines that constitute data science with my passion for engaging in work where I can have a positive impact.”","The success of Fatehkia’s internship is leading IIP to pursue a formal relationship with QCRI, allowing more students to benefit from the collaboration in the future, Duarte-Silva said."],"isopubdate":""}

A detailed, article in Motherboard magazine explained how the whizkids of CA were, perhaps single-handedly, responsible for putting US President Donald Trump in power, and persuading the people of Great Britain to leave the EU.","What was astonishing was how CA harvested Facebook and other social media and created individual demographic and psychographic profiles of tens of millions of voters in the US. It then individually targeted people with messages on who to vote for, who not to, when to go out and vote, and, in certain cases, not to do so.","I set out to find out how this could possibly happen, and if there were other Cambridge Analyticas in the wild, which we could use for our businesses. I found two things: What CA did was painstakingly done over many years, mostly through Facebook, which was borderline illegal; and that there were other firms out there, who could not do a CA on you, but come pretty close.","Well, Cambridge Analytica is in the news again, and how! And, it has also dragged in a much larger beast into the spotlight: Facebook.","Facebook has been in the spotlight before. Many times, it has been there for the wrong reasons – privacy, security, free basics, payments, non-compliance of regulation. However, the current situation is perhaps its most dire yet, and I believe that it is the end of Facebook as we know it.","The company will have to relook its technology, security and privacy policies as a whole. Beyond that, it will have to reconsider its core business model, and also its whole set of beliefs and values, the way Uber is doing.","Talking of Uber, when the Travis Kalanick controversy, and subsequent sacking, broke upon us, I had spoken about how perhaps Travis should be replaced by a Blockchain! Again, I want to explore and suggest as to how perhaps Blockchain can be the answer to Facebook’s problems, and even be its disruptor.","Let us understand the Blockchain first: it is a distributed database shared among a network of computers, all of which must approve a transaction before it can be recorded. So, it is essentially a universal ledger in the cloud, of digital records (or identity)—one that’s shared between various parties.","It can only be updated by consensus of a majority of the participants. So, it is a pure peer-to-peer network, which can be used to exchange digital assets without friction (no central ledger and transactions between people can happen nearly instantly without any intermediary), execute smart contracts (contracts and documents can be stored electronically, and executed algorithmically), and store digital records (have an electronic identity).","Above all, the Blockchain is the ultimate decentraliser.","This bit was actually supposed to be the Internet’s responsibility. The Internet, in fact, did solve a multitude of problems for us: it solved the information, distribution and communication problems with search, ecommerce and email/chat. However, there were two other problems it was supposed to address: trust and intermediation.","The Internet was supposed to be the ultimate disintermediator – create a level playing field, help the long tail, and destroy monopolies. This has not happened; arguably, the Internet created bigger monopolies and intermediaries than ever. Google monopolises information, Amazon monopolises online shopping, and Facebook monopolises connections, communication and interactions.","On the Internet, if it is free, then you are the product.","Therefore, Facebook’s powerful business model is all about monetising you, and your data. It serves to collect every single piece of information, emotion, intention, location and connection you have, make sense out of it for an advertiser, and sell this packaged and massaged information to them.","Facebook has vast repositories of this data – the new oil – in its server farms: data from its eponymous two billion strong social network, from Instagram, and now from Whatsapp.","It is estimated that more than 90 percent of all the trillions of pictures out there are hosted by Facebook or one of its companies! Around 70 percent of Facebook is now accessed on the mobile phone, so its already rich data is further enhanced by location, proximity, and your phone connections (on WhatsApp).","Facebook has powerful incentives to collect and store as much data as it can so that its formidable machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms crunch this to create devastatingly accurate profiles of you. Machine learning algorithms are an insatiable beast, and the more data they ingest, the more powerful they become. The more the data, the sharper your profile, the more specifically targeted the advertising, the more the advertisers pay for it. This business model is a self-propelling machine, a fission reactor of data.","Except that now, the fissile material has reached critical mass, and, Frankenstein-like, has the potential to explode in the face of its creators.","What if there was a different business model, and what if it was decentralised? Imagine if the architecture of the social network was on a Blockchain, and each user was a node on the same. The user would specify what data could be shared or not, and if it were to be so, it would be by some kind of consensus, rather than being decided by one single centralized monopoly.","Based on the data the user shared with the advertiser, the advertiser would directly pay the user through a set of self-actuating smart contracts. And, the payment would be through some manner of cryptocurrency tokens or coins. These coins, in turn, could be used to buy user data, or exchanged for goods and services. They can also be freely listed and traded on a crypto exchange, and be redeemed for other cryptocurrency or fiat currency.","This would be a win-win for the user and the advertiser: the user would get paid for sharing her data and would control the extent of data shared, and the advertiser would still pay, but to a bunch of its customers, rather than one monolithic identity. There is then the obvious advantage of security. Given the distributed, consensus-driven nature of Blockchain, an external agency like CA cannot just harvest data without explicit permission, and distributed consensus. This was the loophole that CA employed in the current architecture.","The above is not my original idea, and is not wholly fiction. There are Social 3.0 networks mushrooming, networks that do not ‘sell’ you, and involve direct payments between producers and consumers. Steemit (www.steemit.com ) is one such example: It is a Blockchain based platform, where you get paid for good content; users post and upvote articles on Steemit to get your share of the daily rewards pool.","There are already competitors to Uber emerging, for example, where drivers and passengers directly fix rides and pay each other through smart contracts. This has started emerging in music and content too, where the musician directly sells her music to her customers, rather than through iTunes, and gets paid through Bitcoin or Ether or equivalent.","All of these ideas are in their infancy, but these are the future. They are true Peer-to-Peer or P2P networks. Facebook is not P2P, it is P2F2P; neither is YouTube frankly, which is P2Y2P. The Blockchain, as previously stated, is potentially the great decentraliser.","It is not surprising, therefore, that Mark Zuckerberg had already started exploring Blockchain and Crypto, and, in fact, made it his mission for this year. He knows, perhaps better than us, that Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. He will have to lead Facebook’s charge into new business models, or a Blockchain-based competitor will come and disrupt him.","(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

But, the events that unfolded last week underlined the extent of complexities that can be created in society based on how data is used.","A year-long investigation by multiple media outlets in the US and Britain revealed that a consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, accessed data of at least 50 million social media users without their proper consent. The data was then used to psychologically profile people and individually target them with politically-motivated content to manipulate the 2016 US presidential election. A similar approach was used to influence electoral outcomes all over the world, possibly even in India.","Even though the process of manipulating the political narrative during elections is not something new, there is something sinister about for-profit organisations and foreign agents using data technologies to disrupt democratic norms.","The offices of Cambridge Analytica in central London. AP","If electoral outcomes come to be defined by exploiting deep-rooted psychological fears of voters based on data analytics, instead of developmental issues that drive progress and prosperity, social cohesion will fall under immediate threat, proving pernicious to the very fabric of democracy. The political vision of governments and politicians needs to be steered by people instead of mathematical algorithms.","It must be highlighted that social media and the vast explosion of data because of it are not the problems per se. However, when societies find themselves being increasingly run by data, a defined set of ethical norms need to be formulated to guide its use. The issue is of the utmost importance for India, as it has a significant online presence that is vulnerable to privacy violations. It has the highest number of Facebook users and the second-highest number of Twitter users in the world—with a combined reach of almost 300 million.","A committee of experts under Justice BN Srikrishna has already been set up to deliberate on a data protection framework for India. It is working on drafting a data protection bill and has deliberated on a number of pertinent issues like what constitutes \"personal data\", the specifications of consent and establishment of a data protection authority. A white paper has also been published by the authority, detailing a lengthy discourse on these very issues.","Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology has also listed \"Citizens' data security and privacy\" as a subject of study. However, not much seems to have been done on the subject. Recent events might hopefully set the ball rolling on that front and inspire a multi-partisan report on the matter.","Once the processes of setting up a robust framework of regulatory policy and statutory law to govern matters of data privacy are complete, there will be a need to establish cultural expectations that incorporate ethical standards right when the data technologies are being built.","The application of regulatory mechanisms after individuals have been profiled is akin to closing the stable doors after the horses have bolted. The race to become the next-big-thing in technology has placed ethics on the backseat and, hence, it is often the case that investigations are conducted and apologies demanded, only after the damage has been done. The environment of \"develop first, question later\" will have to change.","The issue of data and privacy regulations will become even more important as technological companies gain greater market share in the area of financial services instead of traditional banks. When you instantly transfer money to friends and family over apps like WhatsApp to avoid the hassle of asking around for bank account numbers, the company gains direct access to your transactions. The power of that data will lie with the entity which possess it. Interestingly, retail banks will begin to lose out on this essential oil as it will be unable to identify customer interactions once it shifts to these new age non-banks.","The use of data mining as a strategic tool, put in the right hands, can be a powerful tool to understand societal preferences and address consumer needs. However, no good comes with a complementary bad, and our democratic societies need to be wary of the latter by building robust security mechanisms that ensure privacy and consent. At times, even that might not be enough. Consumers willingly hand over a lot of personal information for the convenience of services without knowledge of the consequences of their actions and the eventual use of their data. Therefore, it is crucial to create awareness among users in the world of data. There is simply no substitute to a well-informed consumer base."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Twitter has also taken some recent steps to rein in Geofeedia though it has not ended the data relationship.","Further steps are required if these companies are to live up to their principles and policies by protecting users of all backgrounds engaging in political and social discourse. So today the ACLU of California, the Center for Media Justice, and Color of Change are calling on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to commit to concrete changes to better protect users going forward. Read our letters here and here.","We first learned about these agreements with Geofeedia from responses to public records requests to 63 California law enforcement agencies. These records revealed the fast expansion of social media surveillance with little-to-no debate or oversight.","But as we continued to comb through thousands of pages of documents, we saw emails from Geofeedia representatives telling law enforcement about its special access to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram user data.","Instagram had provided Geofeedia access to the Instagram API, a stream of public Instagram user posts. This data feed included any location data associated with the posts by users. Instagram terminated this access on September 19, 2016.","Facebook had provided Geofeedia with access to a data feed called the Topic Feed API, which is supposed to be a tool for media companies and brand purposes, and which allowed Geofeedia to obtain a ranked feed of public posts from Facebook that mention a specific topic, including hashtags, events, or specific places. Facebook terminated this access on September 19, 2016.","Twitter did not provide access to its “Firehose,” but has an agreement, via a subsidiary, to provide Geofeedia with searchable access to its database of public tweets. In February, Twitter added additional contract terms to try to further safeguard against surveillance. But our records show that as recently as July 11th, Geofeedia was still touting its product as a tool to monitor protests. After learning of this, Twitter sent Geofeedia a cease and desist letter.","Because Geofeedia obtained this access to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram as a developer, it could access a flow of data that would otherwise require an individual to “scrape” user data off of the services in an automated fashion that is prohibited by the terms of service (here and here). With this special access, Geofeedia could quickly access public user content and make it available to the 500 law enforcement and public safety clients claimed by the company.","Social media monitoring is spreading fast and is a powerful example of surveillance technology that can disproportionately impact communities of color. Using Geofeedia’s analytics and search capabilities and following the recommendations in their marketing materials, law enforcement in places like Oakland, Denver, and Seattle could easily target neighborhoods where people of color live, monitor hashtags used by activists and allies, or target activist groups as “overt threats.” We know for a fact that in Oakland and Baltimore, law enforcement has used Geofeedia to monitor protests.","Yet there is a severe disconnect between these positions and the data access they have provided.","Beyond the agreements with Geofeedia, we are concerned about a lack of robust or properly enforced anti-surveillance policies. Neither Facebook nor Instagram has a public policy specifically prohibiting developers from exploiting user data for surveillance purposes. Twitter does have a “longstanding rule” prohibiting the sale of user data for surveillance as well as a Developer Policy that bans the use of Twitter data “to investigate, track or surveil Twitter users.” Publicly available policies like these need to exist and be robustly enforced. Here is what we’re asking of the social networks:","No Data Access for Developers of Surveillance Tools: Social media companies should not provide data access to developers who have law enforcement clients and allow their product to be used for surveillance, including the monitoring of information about the political, religious, social views, racial background, locations, associations or activities of any individual or group of individuals.","Clear, Public & Transparent Policies: Social media companies should adopt clear, public, and transparent policies to prohibit developers from exploiting user data for surveillance purposes. The companies should publicly explain these policies, how they will be enforced, and the consequences of such violations. These policies should also appear prominently in specific materials and agreements with developers.","Oversight of Developers: Social media companies should institute both human and technical auditing mechanisms designed to effectively identify potential violations of this policy, both by the developers and end users, and take swift action for violations.","The government should not have preferred access to social media speech for surveillance purposes. We are confident the companies agree. Facebook and Instagram have already cut off access to Geofeedia and Twitter should do the same. It’s also time for all three of the companies to live up to their words by taking the additional concrete steps outlined in ourletters.","Note: The CEO of Geofeedia has asked to meet with us. We will see what he has to say for himself.","Update (10/11/16)","At 11:06 am EST Twitter today (10/11/16) announced the following:","\"Based on the information in the ACLU's report, we are immediately suspending Geofeedia’s commercial access to Twitter data.\"","Matt Cagle is the Technology & Civil Liberties Policy Attorney at the ACLU of Northern California.","Learn more - explore the new batch of public records we're releasing today:"],"isopubdate":"2016-10-11"}

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Shortly thereafter, prominent Trump supporter and American businessman Robert Mercer invested $15 million in the firm. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, served as board member.","In addition to its involvement with the Trump team, Cambridge has also been involved with dozens of other political campaigns in the US and the UK, including the Brexit referendum and Sen.

But This One Is Different.","text":["Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has everything: peculiar billionaires, a once-adored startup turned monolith, a political mercenary who resembles a Bond villain and his shadowy psychographic profiling firm, an eccentric whistleblower, millions of profiles worth of leaked Facebook data, Steve Bannon, the Mercers, and — crucially — Donald Trump, and the results of the 2016 presidential election.","On its face, the incident read as confirmation of many people’s worst fears — that the online platforms we live on are manipulating us, using the personal information we provided in good faith without our knowledge. Add to it that one of those many unintended outcomes could have been Donald Trump’s election and you’ve got the makings of a lasting outrage.","While the main players in the scandal — Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Trump — will occupy headlines, they’re just the context — the perfect conditions for genuine outrage. But the Cambridge Analytica scandal isn’t really about Cambridge Analytica at all.","This is a data collection scandal. This is a scandal triggered by a specific incident, but that is broadly about the ways massive companies track us, harvest information from us, and then sell us as coercion targets in sophisticated information campaigns that could be for anything from diapers to mattresses to anti-vax literature.","The story will endure not because of animosity toward political data use but because it perfectly touches upon a deeper anxiety about our online privacy that’s been building for years. Indeed, the Cambridge Analytica scandal could well be the catalyst for a much bigger targeting revolt — a full-scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we’ve used the internet for the last decade. It’s a moment that forces us, collectively, to step back and think about what we sacrificed for a more convenient and connected world. And on an internet that feels increasingly toxic it’s hard to look at the tradeoffs we’ve made and feel like we’re getting a fair deal.","2. This is every place I have been in the last twelve months in Ireland, going in so far as the time of day I was in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT","You can see this reckoning already begin play out across the media as the focus shifts from Cambridge Analytica’s deeds to more general concerns about privacy and the degree to which our personal lives are catalogued so that we can be targeted by anyone with a dollar (or ruble) to spend online. Over the weekend, Ars Technica reported that Facebook has long requested access to contacts, SMS data, and call history on Android devices, hiding behind a confusing opt-in page as cover.","On Twitter, Facebook users are downloading their data and combing through it to highlight various abuses of trust: that the company kept a record of private phone calls and text message data or that Facebook shared personal information with outside entities for ad purposes. Download your own Facebook, Google, and YouTube data and you'll find years’ worth of personal information: every photo, comment, sticker emoji, video you've ever posted online; every location you’ve visited and IP address you’ve logged in from; every search, every file, and every single website you visited. It's binary confirmation of something we perhaps all have silently suppressed. Every movement you make online — and even where you move about in the world — is fastidiously catalogued, analyzed, and ultimately sold.","Ok @Google. I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway. See recent videos I watched! I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS? 😖😡🤬 https://t.co/NdJqEYfQIV","In the wake of this revolt, a 2010 clip of Steve Jobs talking about privacy has found new resonance in recent days. In an interview with journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, Jobs is asked to weigh in on a then-recent Facebook scandal and lays out his feelings on user privacy, as Mark Zuckerberg looks on in the audience. “Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly,” he says. “I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.”","Today, the clip is presented as a face-to-face warning from Jobs to Zuckerberg and as proof of sorts that Facebook knew exactly what sort of surveillance tools it was building. Indeed, Facebook’s history of privacy scandals makes the current revelations feel all the more flagrant.","In 2007, Zuckerberg first apologized for its controversial Beacon ad program, which tracked purchases on outside sites and posted that information onto a user’s News Feed. “Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. Three years later, in a sweat-filled interrogation at another D conference, Zuckerberg repeatedly dodged direct questions about Facebook’s cavalier attitudes toward privacy. More than 11 years after Beacon, Facebook is still behaving recklessly with our personal information and still making the same apologies — the only difference is that this time the advertising systems are far more complicated and the apologies come in full-page ads in the New York Times.","The Great Targeting Revolt isn’t just about the platforms; some in the ad industry are coming clean too. On Sunday the Verge published an editorial by a former digital marketer suggesting that Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the iceberg. “The contemporary Internet runs on the exploitation of user data,” the author wrote, before citing examples of corporations flagrantly flaunting user privacy to extract data. It may seem obvious but the revelation is profound and the language is important. Marketing is passive but targeting is active and invasive. A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted. Cambridge Analytica, the piece argues, isn’t an outlier but the blueprint for the internet’s vast online ad economy.","A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted.","Now in its second week, the size of the scandal is still unclear. We know that data obtained by a researcher was improperly shared with political consultants and that Cambridge Analytica did not delete the data upon Facebook’s request, but there’s a whole lot we don’t know for sure. Is this sort of improper data sharing an isolated incident or is this just part of a systemic information-control problem inside Facebook? Did the data get passed around to data brokers, states, or other companies besides SCL and Cambridge Analytica? Was the specific profile data used in any way to help target voters in the 2016 election? More importantly, is this data actually as useful in persuading voters as the targeting firms would have us believe? And are the people at Cambridge Analytica the psychographic targeting evil geniuses they claim to be? Or is it all just a bunch of bullshit — less “mindfuck tool” and more midlevel marketing?","There’s evidence to suggest that the Cambridge Analytica team were, at the very least, likely overselling their influence. “When we first saw the pitch the first thought was ‘Why would I pay all this money for this stuff when I could just get our guy from Facebook to do this kind of thing for us?’” a former senior Trump campaign official told BuzzFeed News. And some researchers and psychologists are dubious about the effectiveness of the Facebook data in political ad targeting. Speaking to Wired UK, one researcher argued that psychographic profiling is light on actual science. Another professor who studied voter behavior inside Facebook between 2010 and 2015 told the publication that the Facebook data gathered through questionnaires like Cambridge Analytica’s “may not measure what you really care about” and could have actually corrupted the ad targeting data the company had previously collected.","But none of that may matter much anymore at this point. The scandal feels like a watershed moment no matter how effective Cambridge Analytica may have been. Not only has the outrage endured more than a full week of news cycles, but it seems now as if in it the Big Tech backlash has reached a critical mass, sparking an unprecedented crisis. It’s caught the eye of lawmakers across the world — Zuckerberg has been summoned by Parliament in the UK and asked to testify in Congress by multiple senators; Facebook is now under an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission about its mishandling of Cambridge Analytica data; and across the world, company executives are getting skewered by governments in nations like the UK and, worse, Singapore, where officials suggest the company has lost their trust. It’s prompted more direct talk — even from Zuckerberg himself — of regulation. Anti-monopoly advocates are calling on the FTC to restructure Facebook, suggesting a spinoff of Facebook’s ad network and even the reversal of the company’s WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions to make them competing social networks. It even appears that inside Facebook itself there’s confusion and a sense of dwindling morale. And while the blowback isn’t enough to unseat Facebook in the App Store, regular, loyal Facebook users around the world have put momentum behind a #DeleteFacebook campaign — a novel act of online rebellion despite plenty of previous privacy scandals.","Some news events unexpectedly break through and take on new lives and trigger genuine, lasting movement. Moments like these are impossible to predict or control. The Parkland school shooting this February wasn’t an outlier in terms of casualties or sheer scale of horror and yet that particular tragedy’s aftermath was a breaking point and prompted a full-throated rejection of the status quo. The Parkland students were simply fed up. Fed up with the notion of not having control over their own safety. Fed up with a system in which victims of gun violence seemingly have no agency.","While the situations are drastically different, the frustration at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is similarly about agency and control. For years we’ve read about privacy scandals from the NSA’s Prism program to the data breaches everywhere from Equifax to Ashley Madison. We’re no stranger to the warnings that the platforms we live on harvest our data and that every detail of our online activities acts as the oil that powers the internet’s economic engine and that there’s little we can do, save for opting out completely. But this one lays bare the downsides of this tradeoff — how, despite their pledge to empower us, the platforms we live on have done just the opposite and stripped us of the agency to dictate what happens with our most personal information. Maybe it’s because Facebook feels so personal or because the 2016 election was so divisive, but this scandal is shaping up to be the event that forces the scales to fall from our eyes. We’ve lost control. And we’re fed up.","Every revolution needs to be ignited. Cambridge Analytica feels a lot like a spark.","If you want to read more about Facebook’s data scandal,subscribe to Infowarzel, a BuzzFeed News newsletter by the author of this piece, Charlie Warzel.","Charlie Warzel is a Senior Technology Writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in Missoula, Montana"],"isopubdate":""}

Google and Facebook combined still represent more than half of the U.S. advertising market, but Amazon’s ad business, while just 2.5 percent, is growing faster than both of them, according to speakers at AdExchanger’s Industry Preview in New York City.","Scott Galloway, founder of consultancy L2, predicts that digital ad revenue for Amazon Media Group, Amazon’s in-house team that sells ad products, will grow more than 40 percent year-over-year. That’s faster than Facebook, which is poised to grow about 25 percent; and Google, about 15 percent, Galloway said in his presentation on Jan. 17.","Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said Amazon has aggressively hired marketing talent from top universities over the past year or so. “One in eight kids in my class goes to work for Amazon,” Galloway said.","Another presenter, Geoff Ramsey, co-founder and chief innovation officer for eMarketer, also discussed Amazon’s growth. Ramsey said that although the duopoly accounts for more than 65 percent of U.S. ad spend, compared to 2.5 percent from Amazon, Amazon was the second-fastest growing advertising company last year, second only to Snapchat. Ramsey estimated that this year, Amazon’s advertising business will increase by 42 percent compared to a year prior.

And Amazon’s growth in advertising can also be attributed to advertisers gradually adopting e-commerce as a marketing discipline, he said.","“Two years ago, we oftentimes had to explain why we had an advertising business,” Dallaire said on stage. “But now, we go beyond that, and the tenor of the [client] conversation is more urgent, centered on how advertising on Amazon works. Holding companies are looking to build capacity in data interpretation and e-commerce marketing, while boutique agencies are very focused on search and programmatic display [on Amazon].”","One reason behind Amazon’s growing ad business is that with AMG, it requires clients to spend a minimum amount on some ad products. One product has a threshold of $100,000, for example. A media buyer, speaking anonymously, said AMG can provide managed service if an advertiser doesn’t know how to use the self-serve Amazon Advertising Platform yet plans to spend more than $35,000 on display advertising on Amazon.

{"originalurl":"https://www.travel-impact-newswire.com/2018/03/why-the-facebook-scandal-makes-travel-technobabblers-look-like-idiots/","title":"Why the Facebook scandal makes travel technobabblers look like idiots","text":["Travel technology forums, aka technobabblers, have experienced a shock-and-awe reality check in the wake of the Facebook scandal. I stopped attending technobabble forums many years ago. I just got bored of the starry-eyed delegates listening with open mouths to the usual gang of suspects spewing out the latest techno-toy wizardry and how it was going to revolutionise travel.","That it revolutionised travel is beyond doubt. What went completely undebated were all the now-emerging downsides of the big data movement – privacy violations, linkage with geopolitical agendas, consumer protection, legal issues, accountability and more. Sponsors, mainly travel technology companies themselves, do not want these on the event programmes for reasons which have now become apparent. The result was traditional sunny-side-up talk-shops – just another gathering of people preaching to the converted.","Sweeping these issues under the carpet and shying away from challenging conventional wisdoms still remains an option, of course. But only a complete idiot would choose to ignore a trust-violation of such magnitude. The cash- and data-rich travel & tourism sector is an intrinsic part and parcel of this data-vacuuming operation, and of enormous geopolitical and macroeconomic value to governments and multinational conglomerates.","Indeed, Facebook is just one of many American conglomerates in the data-vacuuming business. Google knows everything about what you read, search for and write. Expedia knows a lot about your travel habits. Marriott and Starwood know a lot about what you eat, what time you enter and exit your hotel room and what you order for room service. Visa, American Express and Mastercard know your spending habits by item, location and period of purchase. Apple phones can track your movements by the second. Airbnb and Uber know even more about your movements. In India, Amazon knows too much about what you buy. Each time you apply for a U.S. visa, the U.S. government harvests a treasure trove of information about your job, bank accounts and much more.","One may assume being protected by the so-called privacy policy. Has anyone ever read a privacy policy? Or even seen one in plain language? Written entirely in legal gobbledygook, it actually gives these companies the right to keep tabs on you – all in the interests of improving their service to you, of course.","Many years ago, I attended a Press conference by a U.S. government official in the days when the U.S. government was working to preserve net neutrality and ensure “openness” and “transparency”. I asked him why privacy policies could not be written in plain language. The answer was couched in equally complicated gobbledygook as the privacy policy. In effect, it was: Sorry, that’s not possible.","A few weeks later, I was at a Greater Mekong Subregion forum in Laos. There, Google was making its first appearance to highlight its ability to provide targeted marketing services to match demographics with destinations. Seeking to establish a fraternal relationship with the industry, the Google representative urged the industry representatives to think of the company as a “big brother” coming to the help of its younger brothers by offering a much more affordable and targetted marketing option. In the Q&A, I reminded him that the term “Big Brother” also has a more sinister Orwellian connotation, that the company knows too much about its users and would he care to clarify whether it shares that data with governments. He did not like that question one bit.","It does not end there. The plot thickens when more pieces are added to the jigsaw. U.S. advertising and PR companies and public opinion polling companies monitor public moods, purchasing habits and viewpoints. U.S. management consultancy companies constantly tell us how we need to re-engineer, compete and stay ahead. U.S. gurus give motivational talks about how to survive in a rapidly changing world. U.S. TV stations and print media lead us by the nose via commentaries and editorials. U.S. finance companies, banking institutions and ratings agencies influence our investment and currency and stock markets. U.S. movies and entertainment abound at every shopping mall.","Now remind me again – this is all innocuous stuff intended to improve my quality of life. To even suggest that the U.S. government or any other government has access to this information, or even misuses it, is to venture into the realm of a conspiracy theory.","As this “conspiracy theory” accusation is now in dubious territory, some collateral questions emerge: Why is all this data-vacuuming necessary?","Simple: For the pursuit and maintenance of power. Some would call it hegemony.","It is no secret that the U.S. government is in pursuit of power to maintain its post-Cold War pre-eminence and counter the rise of new powers such as Russia and China. As every empire has historically found out over the centuries, running one is an expensive business, especially when its gets overstretched geographically. Maintaining a global empire in the 21st century requires outsourcing the policing costs to external deputy sheriffs – Israel, India, Japan, Australia and Singapore to name just a few. American conglomerates are critical players in this game. Having established their presence in Europe, Asia and the Arab world, they are now moving into Africa and Latin America where the regime change agenda is in full swing to ensure governments toe the line.","Over the years, the U.S. government is publicly known to have used various strategies to foment regime change, for example, military coups in Chile and Iran. Then came the era of anti-government street protests such as in Poland, which led to the fall of the Berlin wall. Some, like Iraq, required outright invasions. Then came various colour revolutions and seasonal revolutions like the Arab spring. The more recent ones required heavy-duty use of communications tools to rally the masses, and deceive them. Today, just as drones operated from consoles in Arizona can be used long distance to kill people in Afghanistan, mind-games can be played via social media networks, with location being no bar.","In one way or another, all have at their core the need to manipulate the public – be it called disinformation, propaganda or fake news.","The mediums and methods may change, but the message and objective do not.","The plot thickens further when even more jigsaw pieces are added, especially to pinpoint the financiers. A key beneficiary of this global agenda is the Jewish state, Israel. Zuckerberg is a multi-billionaire Jew. So are Jeff Bezos, George Soros, Harvey Weinstein, Steve Wynn, Sheldon Adelson, and more. According media reports, Cambridge Analytica is almost wholly owned by the family of another Jewish billionaire Robert Mercer, former CEO of Renaissance Technologies. It is a rare Jew who does not back Israel which is being touted as an oasis of peace, stability and growth in a period of regional and global disruption and dystopia.","Anyone wonder how that happens?","Dual nationality is a big help. Hundreds of dual-national Israelis holding American, European, Australian even Canadian and New Zealand passports are living, working and travelling throughout Asia. Many run travel companies, booking engines and reservation systems. They know everything about everyone – every politician, bureaucrat, businessman, general, journalist. Known as ‘sayanim’ (look up the word in Wikipedia) they are ready swing into action to neutralise potential threats. Thanks to the vast information resources, they know exactly which pressure points to apply, how, when and where.","Now, to talk about Jews is all good if it is to laud how smart, kind, benevolent and ingenious they are. To even suggest that they would indulge in any nefarious behaviour such as harvesting personal data, invading your privacy or promoting regime-change is, uh, anti-semitism??","Like the “conspiracy theory”, that spurious, subjective allegation too has run its course.","Start putting the global, regional and local pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together, and it all makes perfect sense – the inter-relationship between geopolitical and macroeconomic agendas, the preservation of U.S. pre-eminence, the protection of Israeli ‘security,’ national elections in many countries, man-made mayhem and the mind-games being played to drive disruption agendas. This year, elections are due in Malaysia. Next year, in Indonesia and India. All are countries of great strategic importance in pursuit of that wider agenda.","The Facebook scandal confirms the veracity of what whistle-blowers such as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden sought to expose at great personal risks to themselves. Travel industry technobabble forums have a golden opportunity to move beyond the parochial idiocy of short-term revenue objectives and take a hard look at the deeper, long-term agenda of the data-vacuumers. My impression is that they will not. They will blandly accept the Facebook explanations, swallow the crisis-management lies being spewed out by the FB spin doctors and go back to business as usual.","Peace Through Tourism","How Travel & Tourism Can Help Restore the Balance in the Emerging New World Order","\"The travel & tourism buzzword of the 21st century will be the search for balance.\"","That forecast was made by Imtiaz Muqbil, Executive Editor, Travel Impact Newswire, in the monthly strategic intelligence publication of PATA, the Pacific Asia Travel Association, way back in February 1999.

{"originalurl":"http://profitagency.us/facebook-makes-its-privacy-data-downloading-and-deletion-settings-easier-to-find","title":"Facebook makes its privacy, data downloading and deletion settings easier to find - Profit Agency","text":["With Facebook facing a wave of public backlash over how it has handled user data over the years — a backlash that was kicked off two weeks ago with the revelation that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had worked on targeted election campaigns using personal and private Facebook data — the company today announced a new set of changes to help users find and change their privacy settings, as well as download and delete whatever data has been collected through Facebook’s network of social media services.","To be clear, many of these settings and features already existed in Facebook, but now Facebook is making them significantly clearer for the average user to find and use. It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks.","FREE BONUS SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD!** Includes Giveaway Rights **","Brought To You By Profit Agency","Free Downloads","Click The Image To Download","Products & Reviews:","The key purpose is to sponsor brands through various types of digital media.

Donald Trump has ordered a Veteran’s Day parade in Washington, D.C., so that our hard-working troops can spend their days practicing drills and preparing to salute their deplorable commander as they march through the streets of D.C. How much is this show going to cost? Conservative estimates done by Trump’s own administration put it anywhere between $10 million to $30 million taxpayer dollars.","Budget director Mick Mulvaney said Wednesday that he has seen estimates that a potential military parade requested by President Donald Trump could cost between $10 million and $30 million.","Mulvaney told a congressional hearing that a parade is not included in the administration's budget proposal because it came up late in the planning process. But if the administration decides to go forward with a parade, the Office of Management and Budget would study the costs.","Yes, you read that right—it isn’t even in the budget for 2018, but Trump has ordered they move forward with it anyway. The most outrageous part is that the Trump administration proposed cutting food stamps to our troops in need. From Military.com:","President Donald Trump's proposals to cut eligibility for food stamps in 2018 would hit hard on thousands of military families who receive the benefit, the Pentagon said Tuesday.","\"It's a very unfortunate situation,\"ArmyLt. Gen. Anthony R. Ierardi, the Pentagon's Joint Staff Director for force structure, readiness and assessment, said of the difficulties of troops who have to resort to food stamps.","How many active duty troops and their families are in need of food stamps? Far, far too many:","The report found that about 23,000 active duty service members received food stamps in 2013, according to U.S. Census data. In addition, information from the Department of Defense Education Activity showed that in September 2015, 24 percent of 23,000 children in U.S. DoDEA schools were eligible for free meals, while 21 percent were eligible for reduced-price meals.","There were 40,056 homeless veterans in the United States in 2017, according to a Department of Housing and Urban Developmentreportpublished last December. The finding marked a 1.5 percent increase from the 39,471 homeless veterans in 2016—the first such increase in seven years.","Feeding America, a non-profit organization and the nation's largest hunger-relief and food rescue group, found the average cost-per-meal in the U.S. was$2.94in 2015, the latest data available. The organization culled data from several organizations and agencies, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and found the cost-per-meal ranged from a low of $2.04 in Maverick County, Texas to a high of $5.61 in Crook County, Oregon.","A $10 million military parade—Mulvaney's lowest estimate, granted it included tanks—could provide $249.65 for all 40,056 homeless veterans. That could provide each of those veterans 44.5 meals priced at $5.61 per meal—the highest national cost estimate, according to Feeding America—enough for three meals a day for 14.8 days.","Adjusting the cost per meal to the national average of $2.94, homeless veterans could eat three meals a day for nearly a month, 28.3 days.","With so many active and retired military personnel in need, it is downright shameful and insulting to waste precious taxpayer dollars on an ego boost for Donald Trump.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The “behavioural microtargeting” company has also received around $2.5m over the past two years from conservative Super Pacs to which Mercer or members of his family have donated.","In an interview with the Guardian last month, Cruz said his funding and outreach apparatus “is very much the Obama model – a data-driven, grassroots-driven campaign – and it is a reason why our campaign is steadily gathering strength”.","Cruz is increasingly seen as a leading Republican contender, uniting factions within the party beyond his evangelical and Tea Party base. In Iowa – the first state to vote in the presidential primary, in less than two months – the outspoken Texas senator dethroned Trump in a poll for the first time this week as the mogul became ensnared in yet more controversy.","Cambridge Analytica has also worked with the Republican candidate Ben Carson, receiving $220,000 from his campaign earlier this year. But the company is more closely involved in Cruz’s presidential bid, with a team of its data scientists currently working at Cruz campaign headquarters in Houston.","Having donated $11m to the main pro-Cruz Super Pac, Keep the Promise I, Mercer is Cruz’s top financier – and the largest individual donor to Super Pacs or outside groups during the presidential election cycle thus far, according to data compiled by the political transparency website Open Secrets.","Mercer’s connections to both the Cruz campaign and the data firm that is apparently helping to power the senator’s advantages were previously reported by Politico and Bloomberg. But political strategists and privacy advocates agreed that Mercer’s parallel funding channels, combined with concerns over the surreptitious, commodified Facebook data – reported here for the first time – represented an intensified collision of billionaire financing and digital targeting on the campaign trail.","“If people begin to be turned off by Trump, the Cruz campaign will probably have a better strategic understanding of the implications and how to capitalize upon them,” said Bud Jackson, a Democratic specialist in digital grassroots campaigning, when asked to review the relationships. “Where a candidate’s campaign may be afraid to go outside the boundaries of ethical behaviour because of a potential public backlash, an outside group may be less afraid.”","In an interview, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said the campaign had contracted Cambridge Analytica “because they’re a market leader and best in the field” but that officials had “done our due diligence”.","“My understanding is all the information is acquired legally and ethically with the permission of the users when they sign up to Facebook,” he said, referring questions about previous research to Cambridge Analytica.","The Guardian contacted Cambridge Analytica prior to publication via email with its findings and a list of detailed questions. Repeated calls were also made to its offices in Washington and New York, as well as its parent company in London. A representative in New York refused to speak with the Guardian and hung up the phone.","After this article was published, Facebook said the company was “carefully investigating this situation” regarding the Cruz campaign.","“[M]isleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do, including banning those companies from Facebook and requiring them to destroy all improperly collected data,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement to the Guardian.","Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist and senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, described the Guardian’s findings as “troubling” and highlighted shortcomings by the FEC to adequately regulate campaigns’ use of data.","“What it essentially means is there is no one regulating campaigns’ privacy data and security practices,” he said. “So it means you have a wild west, where the campaigns can do whatever they want and get away with it.”","Research that seeded data on millions","Documents seen by the Guardian show Cambridge Analytica’s parent, a London-based company called Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL), was first introduced to the concept of using social media data to model human personality traits in early 2014 by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at Cambridge University’s renowned psychology department.","Kogan established his own company in spring that year and began working with SCL to deliver a “large research project” in the US. His stated aim was to get as close to every US Facebook user into the dataset as possible.","The academic used Amazon’s crowdsourcing marketplace Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to access a large pool of Facebook profiles, hoovering up tens of thousands of individuals’ demographic data – names, locations, birthdays, genders – as well as their Facebook “likes”, which offer a range of personal insights.","This was achieved by recruiting MTurk users by paying them about one dollar to take a personality questionnaire that gave access to their Facebook profiles. This raised the alarm among some participants, who flagged Kogan for violating MTurk’s terms of service. “They want you to log into Facebook and then download a bunch of your information,” complained one user at the time.","Crucially, Kogan also captured the same data for each person’s unwitting friends. For every individual recruited on MTurk, he harvested information about their friends, meaning the dataset ballooned significantly in size. Research shows that in 2014, Facebook users had an average of around 340 friends.","Kogan assured the MTurk users their Facebook data would “only be used for research purposes” and remain “anonymous and safe”.","However, the Facebook data was then used to generate sophisticated models of each of their personalities using the so-called “big five” personality traits and characteristics – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism (known as the OCEAN scale).","By summer 2014, Kogan’s company had created an expansive and powerful dataset. His business partner boasted on LinkedIn that their private outfit, Global Science Research (GSR), “owns a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles”.","Documents show SCL agreed to a contract with GSR, whereby it would pay its data collection costs in order to improve “match rates” against SCL’s existing datasets or to enhance GSR’s algorithm’s “national capacity to profile capacity of American citizens”.","In an email, Kogan said he was unable to explain in detail where all the data came from, as he was restricted by various confidentiality agreements. He said SCL is no longer a client.","He said that while GSR often used MTurk for data collection, it “never collected more than a couple thousand responses on MTurk for any one project, or even across all projects for a single client – the vast majority of our MTurk data collection as a company is in the form of surveys only”. He said GSR stores Facebook data anonymously.","Kogan explained that separate from his university role, his private company undertook various commercial ventures relating to data analysis. He said that when GSR collect Facebook data, the terms detail the use that information collected will be put to and make clear to participants that they are giving GSR full permission to use the data and user contribution for any purpose.","He said Cambridge University had “no knowledge of the clients or projects GSR had worked on” and that GSR has never used any data collected as part of his university activities.","‘Packaging voters like they’re consumers’","Today, Cambridge Analytica’s central offering to US politicians is to enable them to use the OCEAN scale in shaping highly targeted campaign messages. This allows candidates like Cruz to campaign on specific issues, but communicate them in multiple ways to different audiences depending on the personal information the company holds about them.","As the company’s CEO, Alexander Nix, explains in a promotional video: “The more you know about someone, the more you can align a campaign with their requirements or their wants and needs.” He did not respond to a request for comment.","Michael Zimmer, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he specialises in privacy and internet ethics, described this as a “particularly problematic” kind of voter targeting that raised broader concerns in the US about “packaging voters like they’re consumers”.","“It’s one thing for a marketer to try to predict if people like Coke or Pepsi,” he said, “but it’s another thing for them to predict things that are much more central to our identity and what’s more personal in how I interact with the world in terms of social and cultural issues.”","Prior to its relationship with Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with a handful of 2014 midterm candidates, according to FEC filings. The firm also secured hundreds of thousands of dollars of business with John Bolton’s Super Pac, formed by the hawkish former UN ambassador to support conservative candidates campaigning on national security issues.","Last week, the Cruz campaign launched a combative TV ad timed to air during a major college football game in Iowa. In the 30-second ad, Cruz vows: “We’ll rebuild our military, we’ll kill the terrorists and every Islamic militant will know – if you wage jihad against us, you’re signing your death warrant.”","Tyler, the Cruz spokesman, said Cambridge Analytica did not work on television advertising for the campaign. “They’re helping with online targeting and messaging, and that’s how we find people online,” he said.","It remains unclear when Mercer’s involvement with Cambridge Analytica began, but FEC filings show the company started working with Super Pacs that the secretive conservative donor has backed during the second half of 2014.","On Wednesday in Washington, Cruz was the only member of the Senate armed services committee to skip a hearing on US strategy to combat the Islamic State. Instead, he travelled to attend a fundraising luncheon in New York hosted by the president of Keep the Promise I, the Super Pac funded by Mercer that, one day earlier, had announced a $600,000 digital advertising strategy to be rolled out via social media in early voting states."],"isopubdate":"2015-12-11"}

While you may not have heard of SCL, its political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica has made headlines in the last few years due to work for the Trump campaign and the Brexit initiative. According to former US Magistrate and current Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal, this move is occurring because an app \"thisisyourdigitallife\" pulled in personal information of the 270,000 people who used it as well as information from their friends. While this is allowed under its policy, its creator -- a Cambridge psych professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan -- passed the data onto other parties including Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook's stance is that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015, which Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, said they did. The social network disagrees, and said it has been informed that not all of the data was deleted. Now it's suspending their access while it investigates.","So who are these people and what did they do with that data? Last May The Guardian reported extensively on Cambridge Analytica, citing a source who said Wylie is \"the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica.\" That same article specifically pointed out Kogan's app and its link to the company, which combined psychological profiles with specific names, phone numbers and email address plus information it bought from consumer databases. One of the claims it makes is that as much as promoting one candidate, its objective was voter disengagement and to keep potential Democratic voters home.","Facebook's VP of consumer hardware and former VP of ads, Andrew Bosworth, tweeted \"We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies. They cannot buy ads or administer its clients' pages.\" Facebook also noted that in 2014, it changed its policies around how apps can pull information from someone's friends, and now puts apps through a review process to find out if they need all the information they're requesting. But as a report by The Intercept detailing how Kogan's program worked by signing up Amazon Mechanical Turkers notes, the information had already been obtained.","As Facebook continues to investigate, there will surely be more scrutiny from all sides over how internet companies are protecting their user's information. Oh, and there's one more thing you should know -- this announcement comes the same day that a lawsuit filed by a US professor against Cambridge Analytica has been filed. Mother Jones reports that David Carroll requested a copy of the data the company has compiled on him and says that what he received is incomplete.","Update: Cambridge Analytica has responded to the suspension. It claimed it \"fully complies\" with Facebook's terms of service and that its commercial and political wings don't use or hold on to data from Facebook. CA said it had contracted Global Science Research to collect data within the UK Data Protection Act and with consent, but deleted that data when it realized that GSR had collected info against Facebook policies. None of that info was used in the Trump campaign, it said.","We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies.

On Saturday, The New York Times and The Guardian reported that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked with the Trump campaign, harvested information from 50 million Facebook accounts without their permission.","How Cambridge Analytica got that data is where it gets complicated. It allegedly leads back to a Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" a personality quiz that was billed as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","He legitimately gained access to information on 270,000 accounts through Facebook's Login feature, which lets people use their Facebook account to log into outside apps so they don't have to create new usernames and passwords. At the time, Kogan allegedly collected the information, Facebook allowed developers to also access information not only from the people who opted into the feature, but some other data about their network of friends. That added data from more than 50 million accounts, according to The Times.","Facebook changed its rules three years ago to stop developers from seeing information about people's friends.","So far, Kogan's data-gathering was all above board and in compliance with Facebook's rules.","But in 2015, Facebook learned that Kogan had passed on that data to Cambridge Analytica, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, said in a blog post. When Facebook found out, the social network demanded Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy the data. Facebook said it received certifications they had complied.","Now, there are allegations not all the data had been destroyed.","In reaction to the controversy, Facebook's most senior executives have been trying to stress that Facebook was deceived. Kogan shouldn't have passed on the data, they said, and those involved shouldn't have lied about deleting all of it.","\"[Kogan] lied to those users and he lied to Facebook about what he was using the data for,\" Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a now-deleted tweet.","But the dust-up raises several questions about Facebook's responsibility in all of this. Facebook's trove of data on its 2 billion monthly users is a powerful tool. It helps millions of people connect with one another, while also helping advertisers send targeted ads based on what people put in their profiles.","To what extent is Facebook responsible for bad actors who abuse developer agreements? Could Facebook have done more to ensure the data had been destroyed -- beyond accepting certifications it was deleted? How can the social network try to make sure other developers don't pass on the data they collect to other parties?","Facebook didn't respond to CNET's request for comment asking the company these questions.","Still, critics put the blame squarely on the social network. \"Facebook leaders think we are questioning their motives and sincerity. Hardly,\" tweeted Siva Vaidhyanathan, director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia. \"We are calling them out on their policies, actions, and their consequences.\"","Facebook leaders think we are questioning their motives and sincerity. Hardly. We are calling them out on their policies, actions, and their consequences.","For Facebook's part, Grewal said Facebook has made changes to how it deals with developers in the last five years. For example, the need to undergo an app review that requires them to justify collecting certain types of date.","A broader problem","What happened with Cambridge Analytica is just the latest in a growing list of ways Facebook's platform has been reportedly misused.","Malicious actors from propagandists to trolls have been abusing its systems for sometimes nefarious ends. The social network is still under fire for Russian trolls abusing Facebook with ads and organic posts to sow discord among Americans and influence the 2016 election.","Because of that, Facebook has drawn ire from lawmakers threatening to impose regulations on the social network and its advertising business. Last November, Facebook, along with Twitter and Google, sent their general counsels to hearings on Capitol Hill for a grilling from members of Congress.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","But perhaps the most concerning part is that the Russians -- and now Cambridge Analytica -- didn't abuse Facebook by breaching its security. There were no passwords stolen, no systems hacked. Instead, they used Facebook's products exactly as they were built (though in the case of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, the rule-breaking allegedly came later).","Stamos and Andrew Bosworth, another top exec at Facebook who used to run its ads business, have been quick to point out the difference between data breach and service violation. Still, Bosworth acknowledged Facebook's responsibility to protect people from \"predatory behavior.\"","\"The distinction you're drawing between this infraction and a data breach is meaningful from your perspective, but not from ours,\" a Twitter user named Evan Baily replied to a Bosworth tweet. \"Facebook's platform must protect us from predatory behavior or we can't and shouldn't trust the platform.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

That was the basis that the entire company was built on.\"","Facebook, which did not say how the data was used or misused, said it removed the app in 2015 when it learned of the violation, and was told by Kogan and everyone who received the data that it had since been destroyed.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Grewal wrote.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.","\"We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.\"","The New York Times reported that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica were still online and that its team had viewed some of the raw data.","Cambridge Analytica, the US unit of British behavioural marketing firm SCL, rose to prominence as the firm that the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU hired for data-gathering and audience-targeting.","ADVERTISEMENT","POST A COMMENT","HOUSE RULES","1.

The personal data of at least 50 million Facebook users was practically given away to a shadowy data analytics firm known as Cambridge Analytica, now known for its devious methods to influence elections and carry out blackmail operations.","That may seem like a big deal, but let’s be honest, this kind of thing probably happens far more and on a much more regular basis than anyone would like to admit. I’m willing to bet that the vast majority of ad-based tech companies have APIs and business models that are ripe for systematic privacy violations.","What’s needed is aggressive regulatory change. And it’s coming. Under the upcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation (coming into force on the 25th May), you’ll have to explicitly state which third parties you’re sending personal data to upon initial sign-up and essentially get informed consent for it if it’s not necessary to carry out legal or contractual obligations. You’ll also have to inform the user and get their informed consent even after they’ve signed up to your service if you want to send their personal data to new third parties that weren’t agreed to in the original sign-up.","Facebook and similar companies could rely on the lawful basis of “legitimate interest” instead of consent but I strongly doubt that will suffice as the ad-based marketing Facebook carries out is not at all relied on by the actual social network part of their service to operate functionally.","In short, hold on tight; we’re in for a rocky ride in the privacy world and big data in general."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Major stories by the British Observer, the New York Times, and most recently Mother Jones revealed that Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm that worked for the Trump campaign in 2016, misappropriated the personal Facebook data of more than 50 million people after obtaining it from a Russian-American psychology professor. Chris Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica staffer, claims that when Facebook learned that Cambridge had harvested those tens of millions of profiles, the company asked that the data be deleted but did little to certify that this had actually happened. The story, as recounted in my recently published five-month investigation, went like this:","Undeterred, [Cambridge Analytica partner company] SCL instead hired Kogan, who went on to create his own Facebook app, “thisisyourdigitallife.” As detailed in a class-action suit against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the app—which purported to be for academic research—not only collected personality data on the 270,000 people who took the quiz but also let Kogan vacuum up Facebook user data on all their friends. The Washington Post reported in late March that Facebook separately provided Kogan with data on 57 billion friendships as part of his work with two of the company’s data scientists between 2013 and 2015. Around the same time he was mining Facebook data, Kogan also forged a relationship with Saint Petersburg University, which hired him as an associate professor and provided him with research funding. He denies this research had any connection to his work for SCL.","According to Wylie, Kogan acquired more than 50 million profiles. He says Kogan then passed that data to SCL—in apparent violation of Facebook’s terms of use—in order to build its psychographic profiling methods. “Everyone knew we were wading into a gray area,” Wylie later said. “It was an instance of if you don’t ask questions, you won’t get an answer you don’t like.” (Kogan denies any wrongdoing: “My view is that I’m being basically used as a scapegoat.”)","This isn’t Facebook’s first run-in with the FTC. In 2011, the company settled charges brought by the agency alleging that the social network misleadingly told its users they could keep their information private. As part of the settlement, Facebook agreed to no longer make “further deceptive privacy claims” and to better inform its users going forward about how it shares their information.","The question now is whether Facebook violated the terms of that FTC agreement when it allowed Alex Kogan, the Russian-American academic, to extract huge amounts of personal data from Facebook and then pass it to Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook’s stock price had lost as much as 6 percent of its value on Monday after the FTC confirmed its investigation.","FACT:","Mother Jones was founded as a nonprofit in 1976 because we knew corporations and the wealthy wouldn’t fund the type of hard-hitting journalism we set out to do.","Today, reader support makes up about two-thirds of our budget, allows us to dig deep on stories that matter, and lets us keep our reporting free for everyone.

But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.","[Update, March 25, 2018, 20:24 Eastern Time]: Facebook has responded to this and other reports regarding the collection of call and SMS data with a blog post that denies Facebook collected call data surreptitiously. The company also writes that it never sells the data and that users are in control of the data uploaded to Facebook. This \"fact check\" contradicts several details Ars found in analysis of Facebook data downloads and testimony from users who provided the data. More on the Facebook response is appended to the end of the original article below.","This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years' worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.","This experience has been shared by a number of other Facebook users who spoke with Ars, as well as independently by us—my own Facebook data archive, I found, contained call-log data for a certain Android device I used in 2015 and 2016, along with SMS and MMS message metadata.","Calls I made to my office number to check my voicemail, and from my office number to find my phone, found in my Facebook data archive. In total, there were two years of call data, from the period I used my Blackphone as my primary phone.","To retrieve a .zip file of your Facebook data, go to the Settings page on Facebook and click the link circled in this screen shot.","In response to an email inquiry by Ars about this data gathering, a Facebook spokesperson replied, \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","The spokesperson pointed out that contact uploading is optional and installation of the application explicitly requests permission to access contacts. And users can delete contact data from their profiles using a tool accessible via Web browser.","Further Reading","Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past. (For Facebook's instructions on turning off continuous contact uploading, go here. )","If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. From Android 4.1 on, a single request from those applications would trigger two separate permission requests.","But until the \"Marshmallow\" version of Android, even with split permissions, all permissions could still be presented all at once, without users getting the option to decline them individually. So Facebook and other applications could continue to gain access to call and SMS data with a single request by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Starting with Marshmallow, users could toggle these permissions separately themselves. But as many as half of Android users worldwide remain on older versions of the operating system because of carrier restrictions on updates or other issues.","Apple iOS has never allowed access to call log data by third-party apps, overt or silently, so this sort of data acquisition was never possible.","Facebook provides a way for users to purge collected contact data from their accounts, but it's not clear if this deletes just contacts or if it also purges call and SMS metadata. After purging my contact data, my contacts and calls were still in the archive I downloaded the next day—likely because the archive was not regenerated for my new request. (Update: The cached archive was generated once and not updated on the second request. However, two days after a request to delete all contact data, the contacts were still listed by the contact management tool.)","As always, if you're really concerned about privacy, you should not share address book and call-log data with any mobile application. And you may want to examine the rest of what can be found in the downloadable Facebook archive, as it includes all the advertisers that Facebook has shared your contact information with, among other things.","Update, March 25, 2018, continued:","Facebook responded to reports that it collected phone and SMS data without users' knowledge in a \"fact check\" blog post on Sunday. In the response, a Facebook spokesperson stated:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","This contradicts the experience of several users who shared their data with Ars. Dylan McKay told Ars that he installed Messenger in 2015, but only allowed the app the permissions in the Android manifest that were required for installation. He says he removed and reinistalled the app several times over the course of the next few years, but never explicitly gave the app permission to read his SMS records and call history. McKay's call and SMS data runs through July of 2017.","In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used. Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.","While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data.","Facebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \"help friends find each other\" after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \"opt-in\" for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \"OK\" button to approve \"keeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\"","Facebook says that the company keeps the data secure and does not sell it to third parties. But the post doesn't address why it would be necessary to retain not just the numbers of contacts from phone calls and SMS messages, but the date, time, and length of those calls for years.","Sean Gallagher\nSean is Ars Technica's IT and National Security Editor.

Unless users had their Facebook privacy settings locked down the app slurped not only the 270,000 consenting users but all their friends as well - over 50 million people according to Christopher Wylie, a former researcher director at CA, who had a copy of the data set.","Facebook is peeved that the data was collected under an academic license and then sold commercially. Dr Kogan has no comment at time of publication, but CA has said it was misled about the data’s legality under British law when it worked with Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR) in 2014.","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” CA said in a statement.","“No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Facebook knew about the incident in 2015 and sought assurances from all concerned that the data had been deleted. What has prompted Friday’s suspension of Cambridge Analytica was Wylie going public to various media outlets with some extraordinary claims about how the data was used.","Down the rabbit hole","According to Wylie the Facebook data was used to build up detailed profiles of the social and political views of around 30 million US voters. Once their preferences had been cataloged, Cambridge Analytica determined what types of emotional and visual messages would sway their views and then spammed their social media fields with professionally produced, carefully crafted misinformation.","Wylie was an early employee of Cambridge Analytica and claims the firm’s flamboyant old-Etonian CEO Alexander Nix sold former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon on the technology. The way Wylie tells it, Bannon, who at the time was editor of the right-wing website Breitbart, wanted to use Cambridge Analytica’s technology to change the very culture of America.","“Steve wanted weapons for his culture war,” Wylie told The Observer. “We offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do which was change the culture of America.” You can see the full interview below:","Bannon needed money to do this, and Wylie claims it came from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and former IBM fellow who is known for throwing millions in funding at right-wing causes, including Breitbart.","Wylie claims he and Nix travelled to pitch Mercer on the plan in New York and sold him on the idea. Mercer pumped US$15m into Cambridge Analytica, Bannon became the company's vice president, and Nix celebrated by slicing the top off a champagne bottle with a sabre that he keeps in the office, Wylie said.","There was only one problem - the software didn’t work. So Cambridge Analytica, in the time honored tradition of Bill Gates’ first IBM operating system, went out and bought better software for peanuts. Documents Wylie took with him after he left the company in mid-2014 show it paid GSR a little under £1m ($1.39m) for the data and the means to use it.","“What Kogan offered us was way cheaper, way faster, and of a quality that nothing matched,” he said. In a few months the profiles of over 50 million Facebook users had been slurped and fed into Cambridge Analytica’s new and improved algorithms. “I was naive and made a big mistake\", Wylie said.","Last month Nix denied Cambridge Analytica had ever used Facebook data for political purposes to the UK's Culture Media and Sport select committee. Wylie claims this was a lie and while it wasn’t explicitly stated, everyone at CA knew where the data had come from.","“It was an instance of If you don’t ask questions then you won’t get an answer that you don’t like,” he said.","In light of Wylie’s claims the UK Information Commissioner's Office has announced that it will open an investigation into the affair. CA is already being quizzed as to its involvement in Britain's Brexit referendum, so it looks like Nix will be back to Parliament soon for another grilling.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham.","“We are continuing to invoke all of our powers and are pursuing a number of live lines of inquiry. Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously\".","Wylie said he quit the company in mid-2014, telling Channel 4 News “I don’t want to work for the alt-right.”","He set up a similar firm called Eunoia Technologies to do more ethical marketing, taking a copy of the data with him, and has since had legal issues with CA But he insisted he wasn’t out for revenge.","Mr. Wylie is a former contractor for, not a founder of CA. He is the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent misuse of the company's intellectual property. 4/8","He claims to have deleted the data before being formally asked to do so by Facebook in 2016, a year after the misuse was discovered by the social media firm.

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a Democratic member of the committee, not the ranking Democratic member. (The ranking Democrat is Senator Dianne Feinstein.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election.","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending information over misuse of data.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Nix told the same MPs: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office.","It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in the largest ever breach of Facebook data.","Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence he supplied to authorities in the UK and US includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he told the Observer. “That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile information, but it was for research purposes only.","So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing of Facebook data.","Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica told the Observer that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Last week, Brooks reminisced on performing at Rodeo Houston and joyfully discussed his memories of opening and closing the event.","However, during his near half hour live on Facebook, he also tackled a more somber topic, risking alienating some fans by using his platform to support the Parkland, Florida teenagers who organized a nationwide protest. The March for Our Lives was held on Saturday, March 24, and Brooks took time to specifically address one of the most prominent figures in the “Never Again Movement,” Emma Gonzalez, and show his support.","Brooks told Gonzalez that the future is hers. He went on to advise:","Just remember when you march, you have a voice, and you’re representing yourself when you march. So, how you march is so important. Be patient. Be loving, because there might be some cross voices that enter in this march. Be tolerant. Be loving. Do not let hate win.","Next, Brooks took a chance, stating that he wasn’t sure if performing a piece of a newly penned song would cause trouble. He emotionally delivered the song, using it as a way to encourage the students of Parkland and those in the “school shooting generation” to stand tall and march with strength.","You can see Brooks’ message to Gonzalez and her fellow organizers around the twenty-five minute mark.","Following Brooks’ video, he received a bit of backlash from those who disagree with the march and what the students stand for. However, if we have learned anything about Brooks over the years, it is that his calm, caring voice will not be stifled by opposing views.","From someone who calls Coral Springs, Florida “home” and whose brother lost one of his best friends (Joaquin “Guac” Oliver) in the Stoneman Douglas shooting on February 14, 2018, I thank Garth Brooks for taking time to pat these strong willed future leaders on the back.

{"originalurl":"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/","title":"Inside Facebook's Hellish Two Years—and Mark Zuckerberg's Struggle to Fix it All | WIRED","text":["One day in late February of 2016, Mark Zuckerberg sent a memo to all of Facebook’s employees to address some troubling behavior in the ranks. His message pertained to some walls at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters where staffers are encouraged to scribble notes and signatures. On at least a couple of occasions, someone had crossed out the words “Black Lives Matter” and replaced them with “All Lives Matter.” Zuckerberg wanted whoever was responsible to cut it out.","“ ‘Black Lives Matter’ doesn’t mean other lives don’t,” he wrote. “We’ve never had rules around what people can write on our walls,” the memo went on. But “crossing out something means silencing speech, or that one person’s speech is more important than another’s.” The defacement, he said, was being investigated.","All around the country at about this time, debates about race and politics were becoming increasingly raw. Donald Trump had just won the South Carolina primary, lashed out at the Pope over immigration, and earned the enthusiastic support of David Duke. Hillary Clinton had just defeated Bernie Sanders in Nevada, only to have an activist from Black Lives Matter interrupt a speech of hers to protest racially charged statements she’d made two decades before. And on Facebook, a popular group called Blacktivist was gaining traction by blasting out messages like “American economy and power were built on forced migration and torture.”","So when Zuckerberg’s admonition circulated, a young contract employee named Benjamin Fearnow decided it might be newsworthy. He took a screenshot on his personal laptop and sent the image to a friend named Michael Nuñez, who worked at the tech-news site Gizmodo. Nuñez promptly published a brief story about Zuckerberg’s memo.","A week later, Fearnow came across something else he thought Nuñez might like to publish. In another internal communication, Facebook had invited its employees to submit potential questions to ask Zuckerberg at an all-hands meeting. One of the most up-voted questions that week was “What responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?” Fearnow took another screenshot, this time with his phone.","Fearnow, a recent graduate of the Columbia Journalism School, worked in Facebook’s New York office on something called Trending Topics, a feed of popular news subjects that popped up when people opened Facebook. The feed was generated by an algorithm but moderated by a team of about 25 people with backgrounds in journalism. If the word “Trump” was trending, as it often was, they used their news judgment to identify which bit of news about the candidate was most important. If The Onion or a hoax site published a spoof that went viral, they had to keep that out. If something like a mass shooting happened, and Facebook’s algorithm was slow to pick up on it, they would inject a story about it into the feed.","Facebook prides itself on being a place where people love to work. But Fearnow and his team weren’t the happiest lot. They were contract employees hired through a company called BCforward, and every day was full of little reminders that they weren’t really part of Facebook. Plus, the young journalists knew their jobs were doomed from the start. Tech companies, for the most part, prefer to have as little as possible done by humans—because, it’s often said, they don’t scale. You can’t hire a billion of them, and they prove meddlesome in ways that algorithms don’t. They need bathroom breaks and health insurance, and the most annoying of them sometimes talk to the press. Eventually, everyone assumed, Facebook’s algorithms would be good enough to run the whole project, and the people on Fearnow’s team—who served partly to train those algorithms—would be expendable.","The day after Fearnow took that second screenshot was a Friday. When he woke up after sleeping in, he noticed that he had about 30 meeting notifications from Facebook on his phone. When he replied to say it was his day off, he recalls, he was nonetheless asked to be available in 10 minutes. Soon he was on a video­conference with three Facebook employees, including Sonya Ahuja, the company’s head of investigations. According to his recounting of the meeting, she asked him if he had been in touch with Nuñez. He denied that he had been. Then she told him that she had their messages on Gchat, which Fearnow had assumed weren’t accessible to Facebook. He was fired. “Please shut your laptop and don’t reopen it,” she instructed him.","That same day, Ahuja had another conversation with a second employee at Trending Topics named Ryan Villarreal. Several years before, he and Fearnow had shared an apartment with Nuñez. Villarreal said he hadn’t taken any screenshots, and he certainly hadn’t leaked them. But he had clicked “like” on the story about Black Lives Matter, and he was friends with Nuñez on Facebook. “Do you think leaks are bad?” Ahuja demanded to know, according to Villarreal. He was fired too. The last he heard from his employer was in a letter from BCforward. The company had given him $15 to cover expenses, and it wanted the money back.","The firing of Fearnow and Villarreal set the Trending Topics team on edge—and Nuñez kept digging for dirt. He soon published a story about the internal poll showing Facebookers’ interest in fending off Trump. Then, in early May, he published an article based on conversations with yet a third former Trending Topics employee, under the blaring headline “Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News.” The piece suggested that Facebook’s Trending team worked like a Fox News fever dream, with a bunch of biased curators “injecting” liberal stories and “blacklisting” conservative ones. Within a few hours the piece popped onto half a dozen highly trafficked tech and politics websites, including Drudge Report and Breitbart News.","The post went viral, but the ensuing battle over Trending Topics did more than just dominate a few news cycles. In ways that are only fully visible now, it set the stage for the most tumultuous two years of Facebook’s existence—triggering a chain of events that would distract and confuse the company while larger disasters began to engulf it.","This is the story of those two years, as they played out inside and around the company. WIRED spoke with 51 current or former Facebook employees for this article, many of whom did not want their names used, for reasons anyone familiar with the story of Fearnow and Villarreal would surely understand. (One current employee asked that a WIRED reporter turn off his phone so the company would have a harder time tracking whether it had been near the phones of anyone from Facebook.)","The stories varied, but most people told the same basic tale: of a company, and a CEO, whose techno-optimism has been crushed as they’ve learned the myriad ways their platform can be used for ill. Of an election that shocked Facebook, even as its fallout put the company under siege. Of a series of external threats, defensive internal calculations, and false starts that delayed Facebook’s reckoning with its impact on global affairs and its users’ minds. And—in the tale’s final chapters—of the company’s earnest attempt to redeem itself.","In that saga, Fearnow plays one of those obscure but crucial roles that history occasionally hands out. He’s the Franz Ferdinand of Facebook—or maybe he’s more like the archduke’s hapless young assassin. Either way, in the rolling disaster that has enveloped Facebook since early 2016, Fearnow’s leaks probably ought to go down as the screenshots heard round the world.","II","By now, the story of Facebook’s all-consuming growth is practically the creation myth of our information era. What began as a way to connect with your friends at Harvard became a way to connect with people at other elite schools, then at all schools, and then everywhere. After that, your Facebook login became a way to log on to other internet sites. Its Messenger app started competing with email and texting. It became the place where you told people you were safe after an earthquake. In some countries like the Philippines, it effectively is the internet.","The furious energy of this big bang emanated, in large part, from a brilliant and simple insight. Humans are social animals. But the internet is a cesspool. That scares people away from identifying themselves and putting personal details online. Solve that problem—make people feel safe to post—and they will share obsessively. Make the resulting database of privately shared information and personal connections available to advertisers, and that platform will become one of the most important media technologies of the early 21st century.","But as powerful as that original insight was, Facebook’s expansion has also been driven by sheer brawn. Zuckerberg has been a determined, even ruthless, steward of the company’s manifest destiny, with an uncanny knack for placing the right bets. In the company’s early days, “move fast and break things” wasn’t just a piece of advice to his developers; it was a philosophy that served to resolve countless delicate trade-offs—many of them involving user privacy—in ways that best favored the platform’s growth. And when it comes to competitors, Zuckerberg has been relentless in either acquiring or sinking any challengers that seem to have the wind at their backs.","Facebook’s Reckoning","Two years that forced the platform to change","by Blanca Myers","March 2016","Facebook suspends Benjamin Fearnow, a journalist-­curator for the platform’s Trending Topics feed, after he leaks to Gizmodo.","November 2017","January 2018","Facebook begins announcing major changes, aimed to ensure that time on the platform will be “time well spent.”","In fact, it was in besting just such a rival that Facebook came to dominate how we discover and consume news. Back in 2012, the most exciting social network for distributing news online wasn’t Facebook, it was Twitter. The latter’s 140-character posts accelerated the speed at which news could spread, allowing its influence in the news industry to grow much faster than Facebook’s. “Twitter was this massive, massive threat,” says a former Facebook executive heavily involved in the decisionmaking at the time.","So Zuckerberg pursued a strategy he has often deployed against competitors he cannot buy: He copied, then crushed. He adjusted Facebook’s News Feed to fully incorporate news (despite its name, the feed was originally tilted toward personal news) and adjusted the product so that it showed author bylines and headlines. Then Facebook’s emissaries fanned out to talk with journalists and explain how to best reach readers through the platform. By the end of 2013, Facebook had doubled its share of traffic to news sites and had started to push Twitter into a decline. By the middle of 2015, it had surpassed Google as the leader in referring readers to publisher sites and was now referring 13 times as many readers to news publishers as Twitter. That year, Facebook launched Instant Articles, offering publishers the chance to publish directly on the platform. Posts would load faster and look sharper if they agreed, but the publishers would give up an element of control over the content. The publishing industry, which had been reeling for years, largely assented. Facebook now effectively owned the news. “If you could reproduce Twitter inside of Facebook, why would you go to Twitter?” says the former executive. “What they are doing to Snapchat now, they did to Twitter back then.”","It appears that Facebook did not, however, carefully think through the implications of becoming the dominant force in the news industry. Everyone in management cared about quality and accuracy, and they had set up rules, for example, to eliminate pornography and protect copyright. But Facebook hired few journalists and spent little time discussing the big questions that bedevil the media industry. What is fair? What is a fact? How do you signal the difference between news, analysis, satire, and opinion? Facebook has long seemed to think it has immunity from those debates because it is just a technology company—one that has built a “platform for all ideas.”","This notion that Facebook is an open, neutral platform is almost like a religious tenet inside the company. When new recruits come in, they are treated to an orientation lecture by Chris Cox, the company’s chief product officer, who tells them Facebook is an entirely new communications platform for the 21st century, as the telephone was for the 20th. But if anyone inside Facebook is unconvinced by religion, there is also Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act to recommend the idea. This is the section of US law that shelters internet intermediaries from liability for the content their users post. If Facebook were to start creating or editing content on its platform, it would risk losing that immunity—and it’s hard to imagine how Facebook could exist if it were liable for the many billion pieces of content a day that users post on its site.","And so, because of the company’s self-image, as well as its fear of regulation, Facebook tried never to favor one kind of news content over another. But neutrality is a choice in itself. For instance, Facebook decided to present every piece of content that appeared on News Feed—whether it was your dog pictures or a news story—in roughly the same way. This meant that all news stories looked roughly the same as each other, too, whether they were investigations in The Washington Post, gossip in the New York Post, or flat-out lies in the Denver Guardian, an entirely bogus newspaper. Facebook argued that this democratized information. You saw what your friends wanted you to see, not what some editor in a Times Square tower chose. But it’s hard to argue that this wasn’t an editorial decision. It may be one of the biggest ever made.","In any case, Facebook’s move into news set off yet another explosion of ways that people could connect. Now Facebook was the place where publications could connect with their readers—and also where Macedonian teenagers could connect with voters in America, and operatives in Saint Petersburg could connect with audiences of their own choosing in a way that no one at the company had ever seen before.","III","In February of 2016, just as the Trending Topics fiasco was building up steam, Roger ­McNamee became one of the first Facebook insiders to notice strange things happening on the platform. McNamee was an early investor in Facebook who had mentored Zuckerberg through two crucial decisions: to turn down Yahoo’s offer of $1 billion to acquire Facebook in 2006; and to hire a Google executive named Sheryl Sandberg in 2008 to help find a business model. McNamee was no longer in touch with Zuckerberg much, but he was still an investor, and that month he started seeing things related to the Bernie Sanders campaign that worried him. “I’m observing memes ostensibly coming out of a Facebook group associated with the Sanders campaign that couldn’t possibly have been from the Sanders campaign,” he recalls, “and yet they were organized and spreading in such a way that suggested somebody had a budget. And I’m sitting there thinking, ‘That’s really weird. I mean, that’s not good.’ ”","But McNamee didn’t say anything to anyone at Facebook—at least not yet. And the company itself was not picking up on any such worrying signals, save for one blip on its radar: In early 2016, its security team noticed an uptick in Russian actors attempting to steal the credentials of journalists and public figures. Facebook reported this to the FBI. But the company says it never heard back from the government, and that was that.","Instead, Facebook spent the spring of 2016 very busily fending off accusations that it might influence the elections in a completely different way. When Gizmodo published its story about political bias on the Trending Topics team in May, the ­article went off like a bomb in Menlo Park. It quickly reached millions of readers and, in a delicious irony, appeared in the Trending Topics module itself. But the bad press wasn’t what really rattled Facebook—it was the letter from John Thune, a Republican US senator from South Dakota, that followed the story’s publication. Thune chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, which in turn oversees the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that has been especially active in investigating Facebook. The senator wanted Facebook’s answers to the allegations of bias, and he wanted them promptly.","The Thune letter put Facebook on high alert. The company promptly dispatched senior Washington staffers to meet with Thune’s team. Then it sent him a 12-page single-spaced letter explaining that it had conducted a thorough review of Trending Topics and determined that the allegations in the Gizmodo story were largely false.","Facebook decided, too, that it had to extend an olive branch to the entire American right wing, much of which was raging about the company’s supposed perfidy. And so, just over a week after the story ran, Facebook scrambled to invite a group of 17 prominent Republicans out to Menlo Park. The list included television hosts, radio stars, think tankers, and an adviser to the Trump campaign. The point was partly to get feedback. But more than that, the company wanted to make a show of apologizing for its sins, lifting up the back of its shirt, and asking for the lash.","According to a Facebook employee involved in planning the meeting, part of the goal was to bring in a group of conservatives who were certain to fight with one another. They made sure to have libertarians who wouldn’t want to regulate the platform and partisans who would. Another goal, according to the employee, was to make sure the attendees were “bored to death” by a technical presentation after Zuckerberg and Sandberg had addressed the group.","The power went out, and the room got uncomfortably hot. But otherwise the meeting went according to plan. The guests did indeed fight, and they failed to unify in a way that was either threatening or coherent. Some wanted the company to set hiring quotas for conservative employees; others thought that idea was nuts. As often happens when outsiders meet with Facebook, people used the time to try to figure out how they could get more followers for their own pages.","Afterward, Glenn Beck, one of the invitees, wrote an essay about the meeting, praising Zuckerberg. “I asked him if Facebook, now or in the future, would be an open platform for the sharing of all ideas or a curator of content,” Beck wrote. “Without hesitation, with clarity and boldness, Mark said there is only one Facebook and one path forward: ‘We are an open platform.’”","Inside Facebook itself, the backlash around Trending Topics did inspire some genuine soul-searching. But none of it got very far. A quiet internal project, codenamed Hudson, cropped up around this time to determine, according to someone who worked on it, whether News Feed should be modified to better deal with some of the most complex issues facing the product. Does it favor posts that make people angry? Does it favor simple or even false ideas over complex and true ones? Those are hard questions, and the company didn’t have answers to them yet. Ultimately, in late June, Facebook announced a modest change: The algorithm would be revised to favor posts from friends and family. At the same time, Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s News Feed boss, posted a manifesto titled “Building a Better News Feed for You.” People inside Facebook spoke of it as a document roughly resembling the Magna Carta; the company had never spoken before about how News Feed really worked. To outsiders, though, the document came across as boilerplate. It said roughly what you’d expect: that the company was opposed to clickbait but that it wasn’t in the business of favoring certain kinds of viewpoints.","The most important consequence of the Trending Topics controversy, according to nearly a dozen former and current employees, was that Facebook became wary of doing anything that might look like stifling conservative news. It had burned its fingers once and didn’t want to do it again. And so a summer of deeply partisan rancor and calumny began with Facebook eager to stay out of the fray.","IV","Shortly after Mosseri published his guide to News Feed values, Zuckerberg traveled to Sun Valley, Idaho, for an annual conference hosted by billionaire Herb Allen, where moguls in short sleeves and sunglasses cavort and make plans to buy each other’s companies. But Rupert Murdoch broke the mood in a meeting that took place inside his villa. According to numerous accounts of the conversation, Murdoch and Robert Thomson, the CEO of News Corp, explained to Zuckerberg that they had long been unhappy with Facebook and Google. The two tech giants had taken nearly the entire digital ad market and become an existential threat to serious journalism. According to people familiar with the conversation, the two News Corp leaders accused Facebook of making dramatic changes to its core algorithm without adequately consulting its media partners, wreaking havoc according to Zuckerberg’s whims. If Facebook didn’t start offering a better deal to the publishing industry, Thomson and Murdoch conveyed in stark terms, Zuckerberg could expect News Corp executives to become much more public in their denunciations and much more open in their lobbying. They had helped to make things very hard for Google in Europe. And they could do the same for Facebook in the US.","Facebook thought that News Corp was threatening to push for a government antitrust investigation or maybe an inquiry into whether the company deserved its protection from liability as a neutral platform. Inside Facebook, executives believed Murdoch might use his papers and TV stations to amplify critiques of the company. News Corp says that was not at all the case; the company threatened to deploy executives, but not its journalists.","Zuckerberg had reason to take the meeting especially seriously, according to a former Facebook executive, because he had firsthand knowledge of Murdoch’s skill in the dark arts. Back in 2007, Facebook had come under criticism from 49 state attorneys general for failing to protect young Facebook users from sexual predators and inappropriate content. Concerned parents had written to Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal, who opened an investigation, and to The New York Times, which published a story. But according to a former Facebook executive in a position to know, the company believed that many of the Facebook accounts and the predatory behavior the letters referenced were fakes, traceable to News Corp lawyers or others working for Murdoch, who owned Facebook’s biggest competitor, MySpace. “We traced the creation of the Facebook accounts to IP addresses at the Apple store a block away from the MySpace offices in Santa Monica,” the executive says. “Facebook then traced interactions with those accounts to News Corp lawyers. When it comes to Facebook, Murdoch has been playing every angle he can for a long time.” (Both News Corp and its spinoff 21st Century Fox declined to comment.)","Zuckerberg took Murdoch’s threats seriously—he had firsthand knowledge\nof the older man’s skill in the dark arts.","When Zuckerberg returned from Sun Valley, he told his employees that things had to change. They still weren’t in the news business, but they had to make sure there would be a news business. And they had to communicate better. One of those who got a new to-do list was Andrew Anker, a product manager who’d arrived at Facebook in 2015 after a career in journalism (including a long stint at WIRED in the ’90s). One of his jobs was to help the company think through how publishers could make money on the platform. Shortly after Sun Valley, Anker met with Zuckerberg and asked to hire 60 new people to work on partnerships with the news industry. Before the meeting ended, the request was approved.","But having more people out talking to publishers just drove home how hard it would be to resolve the financial problems Murdoch wanted fixed. News outfits were spending millions to produce stories that Facebook was benefiting from, and Facebook, they felt, was giving too little back in return. Instant Articles, in particular, struck them as a Trojan horse. Publishers complained that they could make more money from stories that loaded on their own mobile web pages than on Facebook Instant. (They often did so, it turned out, in ways that short-changed advertisers, by sneaking in ads that readers were unlikely to see. Facebook didn’t let them get away with that.) Another seemingly irreconcilable difference: Outlets like Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal depended on paywalls to make money, but Instant Articles banned paywalls; Zuckerberg disapproved of them. After all, he would often ask, how exactly do walls and toll booths make the world more open and connected?","The conversations often ended at an impasse, but Facebook was at least becoming more attentive. This newfound appreciation for the concerns of journalists did not, however, extend to the journalists on Facebook’s own Trending Topics team. In late August, everyone on the team was told that their jobs were being eliminated. Simultaneously, authority over the algorithm shifted to a team of engineers based in Seattle. Very quickly the module started to surface lies and fiction. A headline days later read, “Fox News Exposes Traitor Megyn Kelly, Kicks Her Out For Backing Hillary.\"","V","While Facebook grappled internally with what it was becoming—a company that dominated media but didn’t want to be a media company—Donald Trump’s presidential campaign staff faced no such confusion. To them Facebook’s use was obvious. Twitter was a tool for communicating directly with supporters and yelling at the media. Facebook was the way to run the most effective direct-­marketing political operation in history.","In the summer of 2016, at the top of the general election campaign, Trump’s digital operation might have seemed to be at a major disadvantage. After all, Hillary Clinton’s team was flush with elite talent and got advice from Eric Schmidt, known for running ­Google. Trump’s was run by Brad Parscale, known for setting up the Eric Trump Foundation’s web page. Trump’s social media director was his former caddie. But in 2016, it turned out you didn’t need digital experience running a presidential campaign, you just needed a knack for Facebook.","Over the course of the summer, Trump’s team turned the platform into one of its primary vehicles for fund-­raising. The campaign uploaded its voter files—the names, addresses, voting history, and any other information it had on potential voters—to Facebook. Then, using a tool called Look­alike Audiences, Facebook identified the broad characteristics of, say, people who had signed up for Trump newsletters or bought Trump hats. That allowed the campaign to send ads to people with similar traits. Trump would post simple messages like “This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!” that got hundreds of thousands of likes, comments, and shares. The money rolled in. Clinton’s wonkier messages, meanwhile, resonated less on the platform. Inside Facebook, almost everyone on the executive team wanted Clinton to win; but they knew that Trump was using the platform better. If he was the candidate for Facebook, she was the candidate for LinkedIn.","Trump’s candidacy also proved to be a wonderful tool for a new class of scammers pumping out massively viral and entirely fake stories. Through trial and error, they learned that memes praising the former host of The Apprentice got many more readers than ones praising the former secretary of state. A website called Ending the Fed proclaimed that the Pope had endorsed Trump and got almost a million comments, shares, and reactions on Facebook, according to an analysis by BuzzFeed. Other stories asserted that the former first lady had quietly been selling weapons to ISIS, and that an FBI agent suspected of leaking Clinton’s emails was found dead. Some of the posts came from hyperpartisan Americans. Some came from overseas content mills that were in it purely for the ad dollars. By the end of the campaign, the top fake stories on the platform were generating more engagement than the top real ones.","Even current Facebookers acknowledge now that they missed what should have been obvious signs of people misusing the platform. And looking back, it’s easy to put together a long list of possible explanations for the myopia in Menlo Park about fake news. Management was gun-shy because of the Trending Topics fiasco; taking action against partisan disinformation—or even identifying it as such—might have been seen as another act of political favoritism. Facebook also sold ads against the stories, and sensational garbage was good at pulling people into the platform. Employees’ bonuses can be based largely on whether Facebook hits certain growth and revenue targets, which gives people an extra incentive not to worry too much about things that are otherwise good for engagement. And then there was the ever-present issue of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. If the company started taking responsibility for fake news, it might have to take responsibility for a lot more. Facebook had plenty of reasons to keep its head in the sand.","Roger McNamee, however, watched carefully as the nonsense spread. First there were the fake stories pushing Bernie Sanders, then he saw ones supporting Brexit, and then helping Trump. By the end of the summer, he had resolved to write an op-ed about the problems on the platform. But he never ran it. “The idea was, look, these are my friends. I really want to help them.” And so on a Sunday evening, nine days before the 2016 election, McNamee emailed a 1,000-word letter to Sandberg and Zuckerberg. “I am really sad about Facebook,” it began. “I got involved with the company more than a decade ago and have taken great pride and joy in the company’s success … until the past few months. Now I am disappointed. I am embarrassed. I am ashamed.”","Eddie Guy","VI","It’s not easy to recognize that the machine you’ve built to bring people together is being used to tear them apart, and Mark Zuckerberg’s initial reaction to Trump’s victory, and Facebook’s possible role in it, was one of peevish dismissal. Executives remember panic the first few days, with the leadership team scurrying back and forth between Zuckerberg’s conference room (called the Aquarium) and Sandberg’s (called Only Good News), trying to figure out what had just happened and whether they would be blamed. Then, at a conference two days after the election, Zuckerberg argued that filter bubbles are worse offline than on Facebook and that social media hardly influences how people vote. “The idea that fake news on Facebook—of which, you know, it’s a very small amount of the content—influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,” he said.","Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for this article, but people who know him well say he likes to form his opinions from data. And in this case he wasn’t without it. Before the interview, his staff had worked up a back-of-the-­envelope calculation showing that fake news was a tiny percentage of the total amount of election-­related content on the platform. But the analysis was just an aggregate look at the percentage of clearly fake stories that appeared across all of Facebook. It didn’t measure their influence or the way fake news affected specific groups. It was a number, but not a particularly meaningful one.","Zuckerberg’s comments did not go over well, even inside Facebook. They seemed clueless and self-absorbed. “What he said was incredibly damaging,” a former executive told WIRED. “We had to really flip him on that. We realized that if we didn’t, the company was going to start heading down this pariah path that Uber was on.”","A week after his “pretty crazy” comment, Zuckerberg flew to Peru to give a talk to world leaders about the ways that connecting more people to the internet, and to Facebook, could reduce global poverty. Right after he landed in Lima, he posted something of a mea culpa. He explained that Facebook did take misinformation seriously, and he presented a vague seven-point plan to tackle it. When a professor at the New School named David Carroll saw Zuckerberg’s post, he took a screenshot. Alongside it on Carroll’s feed ran a headline from a fake CNN with an image of a distressed Donald Trump and the text “DISQUALIFIED; He’s GONE!”","At the conference in Peru, Zuckerberg met with a man who knows a few things about politics: Barack Obama. Media reports portrayed the encounter as one in which the lame-duck president pulled Zuckerberg aside and gave him a “wake-up call” about fake news. But according to someone who was with them in Lima, it was Zuckerberg who called the meeting, and his agenda was merely to convince Obama that, yes, Facebook was serious about dealing with the problem. He truly wanted to thwart misinformation, he said, but it wasn’t an easy issue to solve.","One employee compared Zuckerberg to Lennie in Of Mice and Men—a man\nwith no understanding of his own strength.","Meanwhile, at Facebook, the gears churned. For the first time, insiders really began to question whether they had too much power. One employee told WIRED that, watching Zuckerberg, he was reminded of Lennie in Of Mice and Men, the farm-worker with no understanding of his own strength.","Very soon after the election, a team of employees started working on something called the News Feed Integrity Task Force, inspired by a sense, one of them told WIRED, that hyperpartisan misinformation was “a disease that’s creeping into the entire platform.” The group, which included Mosseri and Anker, began to meet every day, using whiteboards to outline different ways they could respond to the fake-news crisis. Within a few weeks the company announced it would cut off advertising revenue for ad farms and make it easier for users to flag stories they thought false.","In December the company announced that, for the first time, it would introduce fact-checking onto the platform. Facebook didn’t want to check facts itself; instead it would outsource the problem to professionals. If Facebook received enough signals that a story was false, it would automatically be sent to partners, like Snopes, for review. Then, in early January, Facebook announced that it had hired Campbell Brown, a former anchor at CNN. She immediately became the most prominent journalist hired by the company.","Soon Brown was put in charge of something called the Facebook Journalism Project. “We spun it up over the holidays, essentially,” says one person involved in discussions about the project. The aim was to demonstrate that Facebook was thinking hard about its role in the future of journalism—essentially, it was a more public and organized version of the efforts the company had begun after Murdoch’s tongue-lashing. But sheer anxiety was also part of the motivation. “After the election, because Trump won, the media put a ton of attention on fake news and just started hammering us. People started panicking and getting afraid that regulation was coming. So the team looked at what Google had been doing for years with News Lab”—a group inside Alphabet that builds tools for journalists—“and we decided to figure out how we could put together our own packaged program that shows how seriously we take the future of news.”","Facebook was reluctant, however, to issue any mea culpas or action plans with regard to the problem of filter bubbles or Facebook’s noted propensity to serve as a tool for amplifying outrage. Members of the leadership team regarded these as issues that couldn’t be solved, and maybe even shouldn’t be solved. Was Facebook really more at fault for amplifying outrage during the election than, say, Fox News or MSNBC? Sure, you could put stories into people’s feeds that contradicted their political viewpoints, but people would turn away from them, just as surely as they’d flip the dial back if their TV quietly switched them from Sean Hannity to Joy Reid. The problem, as Anker puts it, “is not Facebook. It’s humans.”","VII","Zuckerberg’s “pretty crazy” statement about fake news caught the ear of a lot of people, but one of the most influential was a security researcher named Renée DiResta. For years, she’d been studying how misinformation spreads on the platform. If you joined an antivaccine group on Facebook, she observed, the platform might suggest that you join flat-earth groups or maybe ones devoted to Pizzagate—putting you on a conveyor belt of conspiracy thinking. Zuckerberg’s statement struck her as wildly out of touch. “How can this platform say this thing?” she remembers thinking.","Roger McNamee, meanwhile, was getting steamed at Facebook’s response to his letter. Zuckerberg and Sandberg had written him back promptly, but they hadn’t said anything substantial. Instead he ended up having a months-long, ultimately futile set of email exchanges with Dan Rose, Facebook’s VP for partnerships. McNamee says Rose’s message was polite but also very firm: The company was doing a lot of good work that McNamee couldn’t see, and in any event Facebook was a platform, not a media company.","“And I’m sitting there going, ‘Guys, seriously, I don’t think that’s how it works,’” McNamee says. “You can assert till you’re blue in the face that you’re a platform, but if your users take a different point of view, it doesn’t matter what you assert.”","As the saying goes, heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, and McNamee’s concern soon became a cause—and the beginning of an alliance. In April 2017 he connected with a former Google design ethicist named Tristan Harris when they appeared together on Bloomberg TV. Harris had by then gained a national reputation as the conscience of Silicon Valley. He had been profiled on 60 Minutes and in The Atlantic, and he spoke eloquently about the subtle tricks that social media companies use to foster an addiction to their services. “They can amplify the worst aspects of human nature,” Harris told WIRED this past December. After the TV appearance, McNamee says he called Harris up and asked, “Dude, do you need a wingman?”","The next month, DiResta published an ­article comparing purveyors of disinformation on social media to manipulative high-frequency traders in financial markets. “Social networks enable malicious actors to operate at platform scale, because they were designed for fast information flows and virality,” she wrote. Bots and sock puppets could cheaply “create the illusion of a mass groundswell of grassroots activity,” in much the same way that early, now-illegal trading algorithms could spoof demand for a stock. Harris read the article, was impressed, and emailed her.","The three were soon out talking to anyone who would listen about Facebook’s poisonous effects on American democracy. And before long they found receptive audiences in the media and Congress—groups with their own mounting grievances against the social media giant.","VIII","Even at the best of times, meetings between Facebook and media executives can feel like unhappy family gatherings. The two sides are inextricably bound together, but they don’t like each other all that much. News executives resent that Facebook and Google have captured roughly three-quarters of the digital ad business, leaving the media industry and other platforms, like Twitter, to fight over scraps. Plus they feel like the preferences of Facebook’s algorithm have pushed the industry to publish ever-dumber stories. For years, The New York Times resented that Facebook helped elevate BuzzFeed; now BuzzFeed is angry about being displaced by clickbait.","And then there’s the simple, deep fear and mistrust that Facebook inspires. Every publisher knows that, at best, they are sharecroppers on Facebook’s massive industrial farm. The social network is roughly 200 times more valuable than the Times. And journalists know that the man who owns the farm has the leverage. If Facebook wanted to, it could quietly turn any number of dials that would harm a publisher—by manipulating its traffic, its ad network, or its readers.","Emissaries from Facebook, for their part, find it tiresome to be lectured by people who can’t tell an algorithm from an API. They also know that Facebook didn’t win the digital ad market through luck: It built a better ad product. And in their darkest moments, they wonder: What’s the point? News makes up only about 5 percent of the total content that people see on Facebook globally. The company could let it all go and its shareholders would scarcely notice. And there’s another, deeper problem: Mark Zuckerberg, according to people who know him, prefers to think about the future. He’s less interested in the news industry’s problems right now; he’s interested in the problems five or 20 years from now. The editors of major media companies, on the other hand, are worried about their next quarter—maybe even their next phone call. When they bring lunch back to their desks, they know not to buy green bananas.","This mutual wariness—sharpened almost to enmity in the wake of the election—did not make life easy for Campbell Brown when she started her new job running the nascent Facebook Journalism Project. The first item on her to-do list was to head out on yet another Facebook listening tour with editors and publishers. One editor describes a fairly typical meeting: Brown and Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, invited a group of media leaders to gather in late January 2017 at Brown’s apartment in Manhattan. Cox, a quiet, suave man, sometimes referred to as “the Ryan Gosling of Facebook Product,” took the brunt of the ensuing abuse. “Basically, a bunch of us just laid into him about how Facebook was destroying journalism, and he graciously absorbed it,” the editor says. “He didn’t much try to defend them. I think the point was really to show up and seem to be listening.” Other meetings were even more tense, with the occasional comment from journalists noting their interest in digital antitrust issues.","As bruising as all this was, Brown’s team became more confident that their efforts were valued within the company when Zuckerberg published a 5,700-word corporate manifesto in February. He had spent the previous three months, according to people who know him, contemplating whether he had created something that did more harm than good. “Are we building the world we all want?” he asked at the beginning of his post, implying that the answer was an obvious no. Amid sweeping remarks about “building a global community,” he emphasized the need to keep people informed and to knock out false news and clickbait. Brown and others at Facebook saw the manifesto as a sign that Zuckerberg understood the company’s profound civic responsibilities. Others saw the document as blandly grandiose, showcasing Zuckerberg’s tendency to suggest that the answer to nearly any problem is for people to use Facebook more.","Shortly after issuing the manifesto, Zuckerberg set off on a carefully scripted listening tour of the country. He began popping into candy shops and dining rooms in red states, camera crew and personal social media team in tow. He wrote an earnest post about what he was learning, and he deflected questions about whether his real goal was to become president. It seemed like a well-­meaning effort to win friends for Facebook. But it soon became clear that Facebook’s biggest problems emanated from places farther away than Ohio.","IX","One of the many things Zuckerberg seemed not to grasp when he wrote his manifesto was that his platform had empowered an enemy far more sophisticated than Macedonian teenagers and assorted low-rent purveyors of bull. As 2017 wore on, however, the company began to realize it had been attacked by a foreign influence operation. “I would draw a real distinction between fake news and the Russia stuff,” says an executive who worked on the company’s response to both. “With the latter there was a moment where everyone said ‘Oh, holy shit, this is like a national security situation.’”","That holy shit moment, though, didn’t come until more than six months after the election. Early in the campaign season, Facebook was aware of familiar attacks emanating from known Russian hackers, such as the group APT28, which is believed to be affiliated with Moscow. They were hacking into accounts outside of Facebook, stealing documents, then creating fake Facebook accounts under the banner of DCLeaks, to get people to discuss what they’d stolen. The company saw no signs of a serious, concerted foreign propaganda campaign, but it also didn’t think to look for one.","During the spring of 2017, the company’s security team began preparing a report about how Russian and other foreign intelligence operations had used the platform. One of its authors was Alex Stamos, head of Facebook’s security team. Stamos was something of an icon in the tech world for having reportedly resigned from his previous job at Yahoo after a conflict over whether to grant a US intelligence agency access to Yahoo servers. According to two people with direct knowledge of the document, he was eager to publish a detailed, specific analysis of what the company had found. But members of the policy and communications team pushed back and cut his report way down. Sources close to the security team suggest the company didn’t want to get caught up in the political whirlwind of the moment. (Sources on the politics and communications teams insist they edited the report down, just because the darn thing was hard to read.)","On April 27, 2017, the day after the Senate announced it was calling then FBI director James Comey to testify about the Russia investigation, Stamos’ report came out. It was titled “Information Operations and Facebook,” and it gave a careful step-by-step explanation of how a foreign adversary could use Facebook to manipulate people. But there were few specific examples or details, and there was no direct mention of Russia. It felt bland and cautious. As Renée DiResta says, “I remember seeing the report come out and thinking, ‘Oh, goodness, is this the best they could do in six months?’”","One month later, a story in Time suggested to Stamos’ team that they might have missed something in their analysis. The article quoted an unnamed senior intelligence official saying that Russian operatives had bought ads on Facebook to target Americans with propaganda. Around the same time, the security team also picked up hints from congressional investigators that made them think an intelligence agency was indeed looking into Russian Facebook ads. Caught off guard, the team members started to dig into the company’s archival ads data themselves.","Eventually, by sorting transactions according to a series of data points—Were ads purchased in rubles? Were they purchased within browsers whose language was set to Russian?—they were able to find a cluster of accounts, funded by a shadowy Russian group called the Internet Research Agency, that had been designed to manipulate political opinion in America. There was, for example, a page called Heart of Texas, which pushed for the secession of the Lone Star State. And there was Blacktivist, which pushed stories about police brutality against black men and women and had more followers than the verified Black Lives Matter page.","Numerous security researchers express consternation that it took Facebook so long to realize how the Russian troll farm was exploiting the platform. After all, the group was well known to Facebook. Executives at the company say they’re embarrassed by how long it took them to find the fake accounts, but they point out that they were never given help by US intelligence agencies. A staffer on the Senate Intelligence Committee likewise voiced exasperation with the company. “It seemed obvious that it was a tactic the Russians would exploit,” the staffer says.","When Facebook finally did find the Russian propaganda on its platform, the discovery set off a crisis, a scramble, and a great deal of confusion. First, due to a miscalculation, word initially spread through the company that the Russian group had spent millions of dollars on ads, when the actual total was in the low six figures. Once that error was resolved, a disagreement broke out over how much to reveal, and to whom. The company could release the data about the ads to the public, release everything to Congress, or release nothing. Much of the argument hinged on questions of user privacy. Members of the security team worried that the legal process involved in handing over private user data, even if it belonged to a Russian troll farm, would open the door for governments to seize data from other Facebook users later on. “There was a real debate internally,” says one executive. “Should we just say ‘Fuck it’ and not worry?” But eventually the company decided it would be crazy to throw legal caution to the wind “just because Rachel Maddow wanted us to.”","Ultimately, a blog post appeared under Stamos’ name in early September announcing that, as far as the company could tell, the Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 for roughly 3,000 ads aimed at influencing American politics around the time of the 2016 election. Every sentence in the post seemed to downplay the substance of these new revelations: The number of ads was small, the expense was small. And Facebook wasn’t going to release them. The public wouldn’t know what they looked like or what they were really aimed at doing.","This didn’t sit at all well with DiResta. She had long felt that Facebook was insufficiently forthcoming, and now it seemed to be flat-out stonewalling. “That was when it went from incompetence to malice,” she says. A couple of weeks later, while waiting at a Walgreens to pick up a prescription for one of her kids, she got a call from a researcher at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism named Jonathan Albright. He had been mapping ecosystems of misinformation since the election, and he had some excellent news. “I found this thing,” he said. Albright had started digging into CrowdTangle, one of the analytics platforms that Facebook uses. And he had discovered that the data from six of the accounts Facebook had shut down were still there, frozen in a state of suspended animation. There were the posts pushing for Texas secession and playing on racial antipathy. And then there were political posts, like one that referred to Clinton as “that murderous anti-American traitor Killary.” Right before the election, the Blacktivist account urged its supporters to stay away from Clinton and instead vote for Jill Stein. Albright downloaded the most recent 500 posts from each of the six groups. He reported that, in total, their posts had been shared more than 340 million times.","Eddie Guy","X","To McNamee, the way the Russians used the platform was neither a surprise nor an anomaly. “They find 100 or 1,000 people who are angry and afraid and then use Facebook’s tools to advertise to get people into groups,” he says. “That’s exactly how Facebook was designed to be used.”","McNamee and Harris had first traveled to DC for a day in July to meet with members of Congress. Then, in September, they were joined by DiResta and began spending all their free time counseling senators, representatives, and members of their staffs. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees were about to hold hearings on Russia’s use of social media to interfere in the US election, and McNamee, Harris, and ­DiResta were helping them prepare. One of the early questions they weighed in on was the matter of who should be summoned to testify. Harris recommended that the CEOs of the big tech companies be called in, to create a dramatic scene in which they all stood in a neat row swearing an oath with their right hands in the air, roughly the way tobacco executives had been forced to do a generation earlier. Ultimately, though, it was determined that the general counsels of the three companies—Facebook, Twitter, and Google—should head into the lion’s den.","And so on November 1, Colin Stretch arrived from Facebook to be pummeled. During the hearings themselves, DiResta was sitting on her bed in San Francisco, watching them with her headphones on, trying not to wake up her small children. She listened to the back-and-forth in Washington while chatting on Slack with other security researchers. She watched as Marco Rubio smartly asked whether Facebook even had a policy forbidding foreign governments from running an influence campaign through the platform. The answer was no. Rhode Island senator Jack Reed then asked whether Facebook felt an obligation to individually notify all the users who had seen Russian ads that they had been deceived. The answer again was no. But maybe the most threatening comment came from Dianne Feinstein, the senior senator from Facebook’s home state. “You’ve created these platforms, and now they’re being misused, and you have to be the ones to do something about it,” she declared. “Or we will.”","After the hearings, yet another dam seemed to break, and former Facebook executives started to go public with their criticisms of the company too. On November 8, billionaire entrepreneur Sean Parker, Facebook’s first president, said he now regretted pushing Facebook so hard on the world. “I don’t know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying,” he said. “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Eleven days later, Facebook’s former privacy manager, Sandy Parakilas, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the government to regulate Facebook: “The company won’t protect us by itself, and nothing less than our democracy is at stake.”","XI","The day of the hearings, Zuckerberg had to give Facebook’s Q3 earnings call. The numbers were terrific, as always, but his mood was not. Normally these calls can put someone with 12 cups of coffee in them to sleep; the executive gets on and says everything is going well, even when it isn’t. Zuckerberg took a different approach. “I’ve expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust. We build these tools to help people connect and to bring us closer together. And they used them to try to undermine our values. What they did is wrong, and we are not going to stand for it.” The company would be investing so much in security, he said, that Facebook would make “significantly” less money for a while. “I want to be clear about what our priority is: Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.” What the company really seeks is for users to find their experience to be “time well spent,” Zuckerberg said—using the three words that have become Tristan Harris’ calling card, and the name of his nonprofit.","Other signs emerged, too, that Zuckerberg was beginning to absorb the criticisms of his company. The Facebook Journalism Project, for instance, seemed to be making the company take its obligations as a publisher, and not just a platform, more seriously. In the fall, the company announced that Zuckerberg had decided—after years of resisting the idea—that publishers using Facebook Instant Articles could require readers to subscribe. Paying for serious publications, in the months since the election, had come to seem like both the path forward for journalism and a way of resisting the post-truth political landscape. (WIRED recently instituted its own paywall.) Plus, offering subscriptions arguably helped put in place the kinds of incentives that Zuckerberg professed to want driving the platform. People like Alex Hardiman, the head of Facebook news products and an alum of The New York Times, started to recognize that Facebook had long helped to create an economic system that rewarded publishers for sensationalism, not accuracy or depth. “If we just reward content based on raw clicks and engagement, we might actually see content that is increasingly sensationalist, clickbaity, polarizing, and divisive,” she says. A social network that rewards only clicks, not subscriptions, is like a dating service that encourages one-night stands but not marriages.","XII","A couple of weeks before Thanksgiving 2017, Zuckerberg called one of his quarterly all-hands meetings on the Facebook campus, in an outdoor space known as Hacker Square. He told everyone he hoped they would have a good holiday. Then he said, “This year, with recent news, a lot of us are probably going to get asked: ‘What is going on with Facebook?’ This has been a tough year … but … what I know is that we’re fortunate to play an important role in billions of people’s lives. That’s a privilege, and it puts an enormous responsibility on all of us.” According to one attendee, the remarks came across as blunter and more personal than any they’d ever heard from Zuckerberg. He seemed humble, even a little chastened. “I don’t think he sleeps well at night,” the employee says. “I think he has remorse for what has happened.”","During the late fall, criticism continued to mount: Facebook was accused of becoming a central vector for spreading deadly propaganda against the Rohingya in Myanmar and for propping up the brutal leadership of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. And December brought another haymaker from someone closer by. Early that month, it emerged that Chamath Palihapitiya, who had been Facebook’s vice president for user growth before leaving in 2011, had told an audience at Stanford that he thought social media platforms like Facebook had “created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric” and that he feels “tremendous guilt” for being part of that. He said he tries to use Facebook as little as possible and doesn’t permit his children to use such platforms at all.","The criticism stung in a way that others hadn’t. Palihapitiya is close to many of the top executives at Facebook, and he has deep cachet in Silicon Valley and among Facebook engineers as a part-owner of the Golden State Warriors. Sheryl Sandberg sometimes wears a chain around her neck that’s welded together from one given to her by Zuckerberg and one given to her by Palihapitiya after her husband’s death. The company issued a statement saying it had been a long time since Palihapitiya had worked there. “Facebook was a very different company back then and as we have grown we have realized how our responsibilities have grown too.” Asked why the company had responded to Palihapitiya, and not to others, a senior Facebook executive said, “Chamath is—was—a friend to a lot of people here.”","Roger McNamee, meanwhile, went on a media tour lambasting the company. He published an essay in Washington Monthly and then followed up in The Washington Post and The Guardian. Facebook was less impressed with him. Executives considered him to be overstating his connection to the company and dining out on his criticism. Andrew Bos­worth, a VP and member of the management team, tweeted, “I’ve worked at Facebook for 12 years and I have to ask: Who the fuck is Roger McNamee?”","Zuckerberg did seem to be eager to mend one fence, though. Around this time, a team of Facebook executives gathered for dinner with executives from News Corp at the Grill, an upscale restaurant in Manhattan. Right at the start, Zuckerberg raised a toast to Murdoch. He spoke charmingly about reading a biography of the older man and of admiring his accomplishments. Then he described a game of tennis he’d once played against Murdoch. At first he had thought it would be easy to hit the ball with a man more than 50 years his senior. But he quickly realized, he said, that Murdoch was there to compete.","XIII","On January 4, 2018, Zuckerberg announced that he had a new personal challenge for the year. For each of the past nine years, he had committed himself to some kind of self-improvement. His first challenge was farcical—wear ties—and the others had been a little preening and collegiate. He wanted to learn Mandarin, read 25 books, run 365 miles. This year, though, he took a severe tone. “The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do—whether it’s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation-states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,” Zuckerberg declared. The language wasn’t original—he had borrowed from Tristan Harris again—but it was, by the accounts of many people around him, entirely sincere.","That New Year’s challenge, it turned out, was a bit of carefully considered choreography setting up a series of announcements, starting with a declaration the following week that the News Feed algorithm would be rejiggered to favor “meaningful interactions.” Posts and videos of the sort that make us look or like—but not comment or care—would be deprioritized. The idea, explained Adam Mosseri, is that, online, “interacting with people is positively correlated with a lot of measures of well-being, whereas passively consuming content online is less so.”","To numerous people at the company, the announcement marked a huge departure. Facebook was putting a car in reverse that had been driving at full speed in one direction for 14 years. Since the beginning, Zuckerberg’s ambition had been to create another internet, or perhaps another world, inside of Facebook, and to get people to use it as much as possible. The business model was based on advertising, and advertising was insatiably hungry for people’s time. But now Zuckerberg said he expected these new changes to News Feed would make people use Facebook less.","The announcement was hammered by many in the press. During the rollout, Mosseri explained that Facebook would downgrade stories shared by businesses, celebrities, and publishers, and prioritize stories shared by friends and family. Critics surmised that these changes were just a way of finally giving the publishing industry a middle finger. “Facebook has essentially told media to kiss off,” Franklin Foer wrote in The Atlantic. “Facebook will be back primarily in the business of making us feel terrible about the inferiority of our vacations, the relative mediocrity of our children, teasing us into sharing more of our private selves.”","People who know him say Zuckerberg has truly been altered in the\ncrucible of the past several months.","But inside Facebook, executives insist this isn’t remotely the case. According to Anker, who retired from the company in December but worked on these changes, and who has great affection for the management team, “It would be a mistake to see this as a retreat from the news industry. This is a retreat from ‘Anything goes if it works with our algorithm to drive up engagement.’” According to others still at the company, Zuckerberg didn’t want to pull back from actual journalism. He just genuinely wanted there to be less crap on the platform: fewer stories with no substance; fewer videos you can watch without thinking.","And then, a week after telling the world about “meaningful interactions,” Zuckerberg announced another change that seemed to answer these concerns, after a fashion. For the first time in the company’s history, he said in a note posted to his personal page, Facebook will start to boost certain publishers—ones whose content is “trustworthy, informative, and local.” For the past year, Facebook has been developing algorithms to hammer publishers whose content is fake; now it’s trying to elevate what’s good. For starters, he explained, the company would use reader surveys to determine which sources are trustworthy. That system, critics were quick to point out, will surely be gamed, and many people will say they trust sources just because they recognize them. But this announcement, at least, went over a little better in boardrooms and newsrooms. Right after the post went up, the stock price of The New York Times shot up—as did that of News Corp.","Zuckerberg has hinted—and insiders have confirmed—that we should expect a year of more announcements like this. The company is experimenting with giving publishers more control over paywalls and allowing them to feature their logos more prominently to reestablish the brand identities that Facebook flattened years ago. One somewhat hostile outside suggestion has come from Facebook’s old antagonist Murdoch, who said in late January that if Facebook truly valued “trustworthy” publishers, it should pay them carriage fees.","The fate that Facebook really cares about, however, is its own. It was built on the power of network effects: You joined because everyone else was joining. But network effects can be just as powerful in driving people off a platform. Zuckerberg understands this viscerally. After all, he helped create those problems for MySpace a decade ago and is arguably doing the same to Snap today. Zuckerberg has avoided that fate, in part, because he has proven brilliant at co-opting his biggest threats. When social media started becoming driven by images, he bought Instagram. When messaging took off, he bought WhatsApp. When Snapchat became a threat, he copied it. Now, with all his talk of “time well spent,” it seems as if he’s trying to co-opt Tristan Harris too.","But people who know him say that Zuckerberg has truly been altered in the crucible of the past several months. He has thought deeply; he has reckoned with what happened; and he truly cares that his company fix the problems swirling around it. And he’s also worried. “This whole year has massively changed his personal techno-­optimism,” says an executive at the company. “It has made him much more paranoid about the ways that people could abuse the thing that he built.”","The past year has also altered Facebook’s fundamental understanding about whether it’s a publisher or a platform. The company has always answered that question defiantly—platform, platform, platform—for regulatory, financial, and maybe even emotional reasons. But now, gradually, Facebook has evolved. Of course it’s a platform, and always will be. But the company also realizes now that it bears some of the responsibilities that a publisher does: for the care of its readers, and for the care of the truth. You can’t make the world more open and connected if you’re breaking it apart. So what is it: publisher or platform? Facebook seems to have finally recognized that it is quite clearly both."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-12"}

He said that the so-called psychography profiles combined Facebook data with information gathered from other \"top commercial data providers\" and that data included specific information about voter \"demographics, geographics, purchase history, and interests.\"","When a Facebook user engaged with the survey, he said, the user implicitly gave the company access to a broad spectrum of personal data that Facebook provides for advertisers. The app reached further, giving the company access to profile data from people in the users' broader circle of Facebook friends who had, wittingly or otherwise, set their security setting relatively weakly. Though the company likely did not use a traditional \"hack\" to access user information, they may have violated Facebook's terms of use by bulk harvesting and repurposing user data.","When asked about how the company chose what to include in Facebook surveys, Oczkowski would only say that, it collects data from \"exclusive relationships\" with data vendors \"and through direct response projects.\"","Cambridge Analytica pushed back Saturday against the notion that it harvested any data, insisting it had contracted a firm in the U.K. to do research. Cambridge Analytica insisted that when it learned that it had been sold data it shouldn't have, the firm deleted the data.","Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data. 1/8","\"Inner Demons\"","Getting users to interact with the survey was key to unlocking the data. A source close to the 2016 Trump campaign and familiar with Cambridge Analytica's tactics explained that the surveys used by the company used inflammatory language designed to provoke the \"worst tendencies\" in Facebook users -- meaning that it would stir up the kind of emotion that would prompt an interaction. Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the campaign. Mr. Trump's 2016 digital guru, Brad Parscale, told \"60 Minutes\" last year that the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's controversial practice of psychographics.","Cambridge Analytica specializes in psychographics, which microtargets ads based on personality. In the words of whistleblower Christopher Wylie: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons.\"","That allowed the company to scale up their data gathering rapidly. Wired reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday that by convincing 270,000 people to interact with the app, GSR managed to tap into the data of over 50 million users.","CEO Alexander Nix described the firm as \"fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" and even tweeted Saturday that President Obama's 2012 \"pioneered microtargeting.\"","But Oczkowski contradicted that assertion, and explained that \"we served as the data agency of record, but our role quickly evolved as the cycle progressed.\"","The company developed \"three pillars\" of exclusive technology, Oczkowski said, including data science and analytics, digital marketing designed for persuasion and get-out-the-vote (GOTV), and polling research. \"Having a large amount of control and input into each of these three areas allowed us to be extremely efficient and reactive,\" he said. \"It also allowed us to easily integrate with the staff at Giles-Parscale and the RNC.\"","When asked specifically how the company leveraged Facebook for other data, Oczkowski explained that the company's data analytics prowess assisted the Trump campaign for everything from resource allocation, calculating the most efficient candidate travel stops, advertising, and the language used in surrogate speeches, and even \"personalizing messaging to the individual voter.\"","\"Huge exaggeration\"","Within GOP data circles, however, the company's extravagant claims about the effectiveness of Facebook data and artificial intelligence are heavily criticized. \"I'm not saying they lied,\" said a former Trumpworld staffer shortly after the election, \"but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration. Data can do a lot of things, but there's a limit to how effective it is. Cambridge Analytica's claims went far beyond that limit.\"","Cambridge Analytica is not alone in their use of Facebook and social media to target consumers with advertising. Machine learning is one of the fastest growing sectors of business technology, and a number of firms have adopted similar tactics. Amazon, Google, Twitter, and a host of other cloud-based Internet giants are hiring AI experts and building algorithms that automate advertising.","It's no surprise that cloud giants are actively using big data analysis models to aid private industry in everything from cybersecurity to marketing. Oczkowski described the potential application actionable data scraped from Facebook users as potentially \"endless.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement.","In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.","Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections","illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data.","I am a self‐learned digital executive, leader, strategist and trainer by profession and experience.

Now, 28-year-old Christopher Wylie goes on the record to discuss his role in hijacking the profiles of millions of Facebook users in order to target the US electorate","The first time I met Christopher Wylie, he didn’t yet have pink hair. That comes later. As does his mission to rewind time. To put the genie back in the bottle.","By the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time. On the phone, he was clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller. A politicker. A data science nerd.","Two months later, when he arrived in London from Canada, he was all those things in the flesh. And yet the flesh was impossibly young. He was 27 then (he’s 28 now), a fact that has always seemed glaringly at odds with what he has done. He may have played a pivotal role in the momentous political upheavals of 2016. At the very least, he played a consequential role. At 24, he came up with an idea that led to the foundation of a company called Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that went on to claim a major role in the Leave campaign for Britain’s EU membership referendum, and later became a key figure in digital operations during Donald Trump’s election campaign.","Or, as Wylie describes it, he was the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool”.","In 2014, Steve Bannon – then executive chairman of the “alt-right” news network Breitbart – was Wylie’s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica’s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the US electorate.","It was Wylie who came up with that idea and oversaw its realisation. And it was Wylie who, last spring, became my source. In May 2017, I wrote an article headlined “The great British Brexit robbery”, which set out a skein of threads that linked Brexit to Trump to Russia. Wylie was one of a handful of individuals who provided the evidence behind it. I found him, via another Cambridge Analytica ex-employee, lying low in Canada: guilty, brooding, indignant, confused. “I haven’t talked about this to anyone,” he said at the time. And then he couldn’t stop talking.","By that time, Steve Bannon had become Trump’s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, had won contracts with the US State Department and was pitching to the Pentagon, and Wylie was genuinely freaked out. “It’s insane,” he told me one night. “The company has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It’s like Nixon on steroids.”","He ended up showing me a tranche of documents that laid out the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. And in the months following publication of my article in May,it was revealed that the company had “reached out” to WikiLeaks to help distribute Hillary Clinton’s stolen emails in 2016. And then we watched as it became a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian collusion in the US election.","The Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation. We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was “information warfare”. But Wylie offers a unique, worm’s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US’s democratic process.","Wylie oversaw what may have been the first critical breach. Aged 24, while studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he came up with a plan to harvest the Facebook profiles of millions of people in the US, and to use their private and personal information to create sophisticated psychological and political profiles. And then target them with political ads designed to work on their particular psychological makeup.","He hesitates. “I’ll point out that I assumed it was entirely legal and above board.”","Last month, Facebook’s UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads:","Christian Matheson (MP for Chester): “Have you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?”","Simon Milner: “No.”","Matheson: “But they do hold a large chunk of Facebook’s user data, don’t they?”","Milner: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Two weeks later, on 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix: “Does any of the data come from Facebook?” Nix replied: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","And through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that – at least in 2014 – that certainly wasn’t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters – records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.","Going public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.","It’s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it’s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic – Robert Mueller’s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer’s first article in this investigation.","It has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind – to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold.","There are many points where this story could begin. One is in 2012, when Wylie was 21 and working for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, then in government as junior coalition partners. His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","Wylie grew up in British Columbia and as a teenager he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He left school at 16 without a single qualification. Yet at 17, he was working in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition; at 18, he went to learn all things data from Obama’s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to Canada for the Liberal party. At 19, he taught himself to code, and in 2010, age 20, he came to London to study law at the London School of Economics.","“Politics is like the mob, though,” he says. “You never really leave. I got a call from the Lib Dems. They wanted to upgrade their databases and voter targeting. So, I combined working for them with studying for my degree.”","Politics is also where he feels most comfortable. He hated school, but as an intern in the Canadian parliament he discovered a world where he could talk to adults and they would listen. He was the kid who did the internet stuff and within a year he was working for the leader of the opposition.","It showed these odd patterns. People who liked 'I hate Israel' on Facebook also tended to like KitKats","“He’s one of the brightest people you will ever meet,” a senior politician who’s known Wylie since he was 20 told me. “Sometimes that’s a blessing and sometimes a curse.”","Starting in 2007,Stillwell, while a student, had devised various apps for Facebook, one of which, a personality quiz called myPersonality, had gone viral. Users were scored on “big five” personality traits – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism – and in exchange, 40% of them consented to give him access to their Facebook profiles. Suddenly, there was a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook “likes” across millions of people.","Examples, above and below, of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test. Respondents were asked: How important should this message be to all Americans?","The research was original, groundbreaking and had obvious possibilities. “They had a lot of approaches from the security services,” a member of the centre told me. “There was one called You Are What You Like and it was demonstrated to the intelligence services. And it showed these odd patterns; that, for example, people who liked ‘I hate Israel’ on Facebook also tended to like Nike shoes and KitKats.","“There are agencies that fund research on behalf of the intelligence services. And they were all over this research. That one was nicknamed Operation KitKat.”","The defence and military establishment were the first to see the potential of the research. Boeing, a major US defence contractor, funded Kosinski’s PhD and Darpa, the US government’s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is cited in at least two academic papers supporting Kosinski’s work.","But when, in 2013, the first major paper was published, others saw this potential too, including Wylie. He had finished his degree and had started his PhD in fashion forecasting, and was thinking about the Lib Dems. It is fair to say that he didn’t have a clue what he was walking into.","“I wanted to know why the Lib Dems sucked at winning elections when they used to run the country up to the end of the 19th century,” Wylie explains. “And I began looking at consumer and demographic data to see what united Lib Dem voters, because apart from bits of Wales and the Shetlands it’s weird, disparate regions. And what I found is there were no strong correlations. There was no signal in the data.","“And then I came across a paper about how personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour, and it suddenly made sense. Liberalism is correlated with high openness and low conscientiousness, and when you think of Lib Dems they’re absent-minded professors and hippies. They’re the early adopters… they’re highly open to new ideas. And it just clicked all of a sudden.”","Here was a way for the party to identify potential new voters. The only problem was that the Lib Dems weren’t interested.","“I did this presentation at which I told them they would lose half their 57 seats, and they were like: ‘Why are you so pessimistic?’ They actually lost all but eight of their seats, FYI.”","Another Lib Dem connection introduced Wylie to a company called SCL Group, one of whose subsidiaries, SCL Elections, would go on to create Cambridge Analytica (an incorporated venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, funded by the latter). For all intents and purposes, SCL/Cambridge Analytica are one and the same.","Alexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn’t resist. “He said: ‘We’ll give you total freedom. Experiment. Come and test out all your crazy ideas.’”","Another example of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test.","In the history of bad ideas, this turned out to be one of the worst. The job was research director across the SCL group, a private contractor that has both defence and elections operations. Its defence arm was a contractor to the UK’s Ministry of Defence and the US’s Department of Defense, among others. Its expertise was in “psychological operations” – or psyops –changing people’s minds not through persuasion but through “informational dominance”, a set of techniques that includes rumour, disinformation and fake news.","SCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to realise were unequipped to defend themselves.","Wylie holds a British Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa – a UK work visa given to just 200 people a year. He was working inside government (with the Lib Dems) as a political strategist with advanced data science skills. But no one, least of all him, could have predicted what came next. When he turned up at SCL’s offices in Mayfair, he had no clue that he was walking into the middle of a nexus of defence and intelligence projects, private contractors and cutting-edge cyberweaponry.","“The thing I think about all the time is, what if I’d taken a job at Deloitte instead? They offered me one. I just think if I’d taken literally any other job, Cambridge Analytica wouldn’t exist. You have no idea how much I brood on this.”","A few months later, in autumn 2013, Wylie met Steve Bannon. At the time, he was editor-in-chief of Breitbart, which he had brought to Britain to support his friend Nigel Farage in his mission to take Britain out of the European Union.","What was he like?","“Smart,” says Wylie. “Interesting. Really interested in ideas. He’s the only straight man I’ve ever talked to about intersectional feminist theory. He saw its relevance straightaway to the oppressions that conservative, young white men feel.”","Wylie meeting Bannon was the moment petrol was poured on a flickering flame. Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time. He had a theory to prove. And at the time, this was a purely intellectual problem. Politics was like fashion, he told Bannon.","If you do not respect the agency of people, anything you do after that point is not conducive to democracy","Christopher Wylie","“[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’ to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.”","But Wylie wasn’t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: “information operations”, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military’s doctrine of the “five-dimensional battle space”. His brief ranged across the SCL Group – the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.","I tell him that another former employee described the firm as “MI6 for hire”, and I’d never quite understood it.","“It’s like dirty MI6 because you’re not constrained. There’s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It’s normal for a ‘market research company’ to amass data on domestic populations. And if you’re working in some country and there’s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that’s just a bonus.”","When I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it’s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. “And the cyberwarfare guy is like, ‘Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.’”","It was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer – the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates – and his daughter Rebekah.","Nix and Wylie flew to New York to meet the Mercers in Rebekah’s Manhattan apartment.","“She loved me. She was like, ‘Oh we need more of your type on our side!’”","Your type?","“The gays. She loved the gays. So did Steve [Bannon]. He saw us as early adopters. He figured, if you can get the gays on board, everyone else will follow. It’s why he was so into the whole Milo [Yiannopoulos] thing.”","Robert Mercer was a pioneer in AI and machine translation. He helped invent algorithmic trading – which replaced hedge fund managers with computer programs – and he listened to Wylie’s pitch. It was for a new kind of political message-targeting based on an influential and groundbreaking 2014 paper researched at Cambridge’s Psychometrics Centre, called: “Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans”.","“In politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it’s the opposite way around with Mercer,” says Wylie. “He said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.”","And to do that, Wylie needed data.","How Cambridge Analytica acquired the data has been the subject of internal reviews at Cambridge University, of many news articles and much speculation and rumour.","When Nix was interviewed by MPs last month, Damian Collins asked him:","“Does any of your data come from Global Science Research company?”","Nix: “GSR?”","Collins: “Yes.”","Nix: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Collins: “They have not supplied you with data or information?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “Your datasets are not based on information you have received from them?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “At all?”","Nix: “At all.”","The problem with Nix’s response to Collins is that Wylie has a copy of an executed contract, dated 4 June 2014, which confirms that SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with a company called Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, specifically premised on the harvesting and processing of Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.","He has receipts showing that Cambridge Analytica spent $7m to amass this data, about $1m of it with GSR. He has the bank records and wire transfers. Emails reveal Wylie first negotiated with Michal Kosinski, one of the co-authors of the original myPersonality research paper, to use the myPersonality database. But when negotiations broke down, another psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, offered a solution that many of his colleagues considered unethical. He offered to replicate Kosinski and Stillwell’s research and cut them out of the deal. For Wylie it seemed a perfect solution. “Kosinski was asking for $500,000 for the IP but Kogan said he could replicate it and just harvest his own set of data.” (Kosinski says the fee was to fund further research.)","An unethical solution? Dr Aleksandr Kogan Photograph: alex kogan","Kogan then set up GSR to do the work, and proposed to Wylie they use the data to set up an interdisciplinary institute working across the social sciences. “What happened to that idea,” I ask Wylie. “It never happened. I don’t know why. That’s one of the things that upsets me the most.”","It was Bannon’s interest in culture as war that ignited Wylie’s intellectual concept. But it was Robert Mercer’s millions that created a firestorm. Kogan was able to throw money at the hard problem of acquiring personal data: he advertised for people who were willing to be paid to take a personality quiz on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics. At the end of which Kogan’s app, called thisismydigitallife, gave him permission to access their Facebook profiles. And not just theirs, but their friends’ too. On average, each “seeder” – the people who had taken the personality test, around 320,000 in total – unwittingly gave access to at least 160 other people’s profiles, none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect.","What the email correspondence between Cambridge Analytica employees and Kogan shows is that Kogan had collected millions of profiles in a matter of weeks. But neither Wylie nor anyone else at Cambridge Analytica had checked that it was legal. It certainly wasn’t authorised. Kogan did have permission to pull Facebook data, but for academic purposes only. What’s more, under British data protection laws, it’s illegal for personal data to be sold to a third party without consent.","“Facebook could see it was happening,” says Wylie. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, ‘Fine’.”","Kogan maintains that everything he did was legal and he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Cambridge Analytica had its data. This was the foundation of everything it did next – how it extracted psychological insights from the “seeders” and then built an algorithm to profile millions more.","For more than a year, the reporting around what Cambridge Analytica did or didn’t do for Trump has revolved around the question of “psychographics”, but Wylie points out: “Everything was built on the back of that data. The models, the algorithm. Everything. Why wouldn’t you use it in your biggest campaign ever?”","In December 2015, the Guardian’s Harry Davies published the first report about Cambridge Analytica acquiring Facebook data and using it to support Ted Cruz in his campaign to be the US Republican candidate. But it wasn’t until many months later that Facebook took action. And then, all they did was write a letter. In August 2016, shortly before the US election, and two years after the breach took place, Facebook’s lawyers wrote to Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and told him the data had been illicitly obtained and that “GSR was not authorised to share or sell it”. They said it must be deleted immediately.","“I already had. But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,” says Wylie. “Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.”","There were multiple copies of it. It had been emailed in unencrypted files.","Cambridge Analytica rejected all allegations the Observer put to them.","Dr Kogan – who later changed his name to Dr Spectre, but has subsequently changed it back to Dr Kogan – is still a faculty member at Cambridge University, a senior research associate. But what his fellow academics didn’t know until Kogan revealed it in emails to the Observer (although Cambridge University says that Kogan told the head of the psychology department), is that he is also an associate professor at St Petersburg University. Further research revealed that he’s received grants from the Russian government to research “Stress, health and psychological wellbeing in social networks”. The opportunity came about on a trip to the city to visit friends and family, he said.","There are other dramatic documents in Wylie’s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: “We have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that “they understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections” but that they were “failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers”. The work, he said, would be “shared with the CEO of the business”, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.","“It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Wylie. “I didn’t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?”","Mueller’s investigation traces the first stages of the Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 US election back to 2014, when the Russian state made what appears to be its first concerted efforts to harness the power of America’s social media platforms, including Facebook. And it was in late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented the Russian oil company with an outline of its datasets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with “consumers”. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques. The first slide illustrates how a “rumour campaign” spread fear in the 2007 Nigerian election – in which the company worked – by spreading the idea that the “election would be rigged”. The final slide, branded with Lukoil’s logo and that of SCL Group and SCL Elections, headlines its “deliverables”: “psychographic messaging”.","Robert Mercer with his daughter Rebekah. Photograph: Sean Zanni/Getty Images","Lukoil is a private company, but its CEO, Alekperov, answers to Putin, and it’s been used as a vehicle of Russian influence in Europe and elsewhere – including in the Czech Republic, where in 2016 it was revealed that an adviser to the strongly pro-Russian Czech president was being paid by the company.","When I asked Bill Browder – an Anglo-American businessman who is leading a global campaign for a Magnitsky Act to enforce sanctions against Russian individuals – what he made of it, he said: “Everyone in Russia is subordinate to Putin. One should be highly suspicious of any Russian company pitching anything outside its normal business activities.”","Last month, Nix told MPs on the parliamentary committee investigating fake news: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do not have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","There’s no evidence that Cambridge Analytica ever did any work for Lukoil. What these documents show, though, is that in 2014 one of Russia’s biggest companies was fully briefed on: Facebook, microtargeting, data, election disruption.","Cambridge Analytica is “Chris’s Frankenstein”, says a friend of his. “He created it. It’s his data Frankenmonster. And now he’s trying to put it right.”","Only once has Wylie made the case of pointing out that he was 24 at the time. But he was. He thrilled to the intellectual possibilities of it. He didn’t think of the consequences. And I wonder how much he’s processed his own role or responsibility in it. Instead, he’s determined to go on the record and undo this thing he has created.","Because the past few months have been like watching a tornado gathering force. And when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something – his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead – it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold. Dealing with someone trained in information warfare has its own particular challenges, and his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off. And not everyone’s a fan. Any number of ex-colleagues – even the ones who love him – call him “Machiavellian”. Another described the screaming matches he and Nix would have.","“What do your parents make of your decision to come forward?” I ask him.","“They get it. My dad sent me a cartoon today, which had two characters hanging off a cliff, and the first one’s saying ‘Hang in there.’ And the other is like: ‘Fuck you.’”","Which are you?","“Probably both.”","What isn’t in doubt is what a long, fraught journey it has been to get to this stage. And how fearless he is.","After many months, I learn the terrible, dark backstory that throws some light on his determination, and which he discusses candidly. At six, while at school, Wylie was abused by a mentally unstable person. The school tried to cover it up, blaming his parents, and a long court battle followed. Wylie’s childhood and school career never recovered. His parents – his father is a doctor and his mother is a psychiatrist – were wonderful, he says. “But they knew the trajectory of people who are put in that situation, so I think it was particularly difficult for them, because they had a deeper understanding of what that does to a person long term.”","Facebook has denied and denied this. It has failed in its duties to respect the law","Paul-Olivier Dehaye","He says he grew up listening to psychologists discuss him in the third person, and, aged 14, he successfully sued the British Columbia Ministry of Education and forced it to change its inclusion policies around bullying. What I observe now is how much he loves the law, lawyers, precision, order. I come to think of his pink hair as a false-flag operation. What he cannot tolerate is bullying.","Is what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying?","“I think it’s worse than bullying,” Wylie says. “Because people don’t necessarily know it’s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it’s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you’re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.”","Russia, Facebook, Trump, Mercer, Bannon, Brexit. Every one of these threads runs through Cambridge Analytica. Even in the past few weeks, it seems as if the understanding of Facebook’s role has broadened and deepened. The Mueller indictments were part of that, but Paul-Olivier Dehaye – a data expert and academic based in Switzerland, who published some of the first research into Cambridge Analytica’s processes– says it’s become increasingly apparent that Facebook is “abusive by design”. If there is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be in the platform’s data flows, he says. And Wylie’s revelations only move it on again.","“Facebook has denied and denied and denied this,” Dehaye says when told of the Observer’s new evidence. “It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law. It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked","Read more","Facebook denies that the data transfer was a breach. In addition, a spokesperson said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules. Both Aleksandr Kogan as well as the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Millions of people’s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn’t have seen, and couldn’t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, “would work for anyone”. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?","It occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.","“Yes.”","Nato or non-Nato?","“Either. I mean they’re mercenaries. They’ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.”","It’s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing – at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public – our intimate family connections, our “likes”, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that’s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.","The Facebook data is out in the wild. And for all Wylie’s efforts, there’s no turning the clock back.","Tamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that she’d pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence.","She calls Wylie’s disclosures “wild” and points out that “the whole Facebook project” has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment.","“It’s a form of very deep but soft power that’s been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. It’s making this point, isn’t it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that they’ve turned on itself.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.\"","According to reports, the ban will also stretch to ads from crypto-currency exchanges and wallet services, unless they come from publicly listed companies.","The decision by Twitter follows similar moves by Facebook and Google and follows rising levels of fraud and cyber-risk as investors rush to cash in on the crypto-currency digital gold rush.","One industry expert welcomed the news. Alexey Burdyko, CEO of blockchain company Play2Live, claimed the long-term impact should benefit the nascent crypto-currency industry by protecting its user base.","“One of the goals of dropping the ads is to protect investors from fraudulent, scam projects looking to take advantage of investors. These scammers are damaging trust in new token sales – so should this goal be achieved, trust will be rebuilt over time, and future crypto-launches will reap the rewards,” he told Infosecurity.","“The presence of scams in this space is beyond any doubt – they are out there, and they are finding ways of parting people from their money.”","An Ernst & Young report from January claimed that 10% of all ICO funds are stolen by hackers or fraudsters, amounting to almost $400m in losses thus far.","Phishing is particularly popular, with attackers scooping up to $1.5m per month by either tricking the recipient into making a fund transfer or handing over the private keys to their digital wallets.","Burdyko added that investors and ambitious start-ups will find a way around the social ads ban.","“The impact of the ban on crypto ads across social media may affect the level of engagement that new token-sale campaigns are receiving, as large-scale awareness will be harder to achieve,” he said.","“However, there are alternative means of promoting such projects, and those potential investors that are serious about backing new crypto-currencies will research and seek out the best new campaigns regardless of social media advertising.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Those questions might be particularly pointed if that same company and executive team had already been at the center of a separate but related scandal regarding a US presidential election.","But Facebook is not a typical company, and Zuckerberg is not a normal CEO. No matter how bad the Cambridge Analytica scandal gets, Zuckerberg is almost certainly staying put. That’s because when it comes to whether Zuckerberg stays or goes, he himself has the final say. There’s no way to appeal to the company’s board, because for all intents and purposes, the board works for him.","Zuckerberg’s power comes from Facebook’s stock structure","Zuckerberg’s unassailable position is due to the way Facebook’s ownership is structured. Like several other tech companies, including Google and Snap, the social-networking giant has more than one class of stock. Though all shares represent an equal stake in the company, one set — Facebook’s Class B stock — has 10 times the voting power of the other.","Thanks in large part to his ownership of more than 75% of Facebook’s Class B shares, Zuckerberg has more than half of the voting power at Facebook. That essentially gives him control over the company. He can vote directors in and out, vote down shareholder proposals urging reforms, veto merger proposals, and quash any effort to topple him — all by himself.","That structure was designed to protect Zuckerberg and his executive team from the often short-term concerns of everyday shareholders so he could concentrate on building Facebook’s business for the long term. That’s a nice weapon to repulse unwanted meddling from malicious Wall Street forces that don’t have the company’s best interest at heart. But as the world is discovering now, when a company acquires the level of power Facebook has, the implications of a dual-class stock structure stretch far beyond the firm’s financial stakeholders.","If Zuckerberg doesn’t want to be bothered with something, you really can’t force him to care.","Dual-class stock structures can be beneficial — and controversial","Supporters of such structures can point to real-world situations where they’ve proved important, perhaps even crucial. Ford’s dual-class stock arguably helped it survive the Great Recession without going into bankruptcy, unlike General Motors and Chrysler. The New York Times’ dual-class structure arguably allowed it to better weather the downturn that has decimated other newspaper companies over the past two decades by allowing it to more easily invest in its online and other digital initiatives.","Still, the practice of giving certain insiders outsize control over a company has long been controversial, precisely because it limits the control everyday shareholders can exercise over a company. Dual-class structures also allow the empowered insiders to run the companies for their benefit rather than that of shareholders or the general public.","Zuckerberg’s singular control over Facebook has already drawn criticism. Two years ago, he tried to force through a proposal that would have allowed him to maintain his control over the company even as he sold his shares. He eventually backed away from that proposal, but only after a lawsuit and stiff resistance from other shareholders.","But now Zuckerberg and his company are under scrutiny for something that is important to a lot more people than just how he treats other shareholders — namely, how it handles and safeguards the data of its billions of users.","According to Facebook and published reports, Cambridge Analytica, the data firm that worked with the Trump campaign to target voters in the 2016 election, used a Facebook app to illegitimately glean data from some 50 million users of the social network without the knowledge of the vast majority of those users.","Facebook was aware more than two years ago that Cambridge Analytica got its hands on the data but basically did nothing about it other than asking it to delete the data. It neither followed up to ensure that Cambridge Analytica actually did delete the data nor, apparently, did it warn users that the data firm had gotten access to their data. And it didn’t even publicly acknowledge the data leak until late Friday, and it apparently did it then only because The Times and The Observer were about to publish reports about it.","Zuckerberg is acting the way he did with reports of fake news","Since the leak, Zuckerberg has been nowhere to be seen. His absence from the scene and refusal to accept responsibility for what has happened are reminiscent of his initial response to reports that Russian-linked groups had exploited Facebook’s network to spread fake news and propaganda in an effort to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Zuckerberg infamously dismissed such concerns.","Facebook’s investors were obviously a bit more concerned than Zuckerberg seems to be showing publicly. Amid worries that regulators will step in because Facebook is doing such a poor job of overseeing its network, they sent the company’s stock spiraling downward. It ended the day off 7%.","Zuckerberg is obviously very smart. He’s also done a great job of growing Facebook into the behemoth it is today.","But when you give someone nearly unassailable, king-like powers, what you really want the person to be is wise and mindful of how his or her actions may affect others. Zuckerberg is showing he is neither.","Zuckerberg is smart, but not wise","To the contrary, Zuckerberg seems to have blinders on when it comes to the power Facebook now holds and the responsibility that comes with that power.","The company holds vast amounts of data about its users. The large majority of its users probably have no idea how much data Facebook holds or how that data could be used to manipulate them. Indeed, for the few who probably ever try to take the time to do it, trying to figure out which Facebook-linked apps or services have access to which parts of your personal data on Facebook can be an exercise in frustration.","Yet the company has shown that it wants to collect ever more data on its users and generally do with it as it sees fit. And it obviously felt little compulsion to govern how that data was used by the partners who it gave access to that data.","Likewise, the company’s social network is incredibly powerful both in its ability to disseminate messages and to control which messages are seen. But Facebook has shown little concern with how the Russian-linked groups abused that power.","Facebook has more than 2 billion users, an unprecedented level of power and influence for a single company. It’s so large that its actions and policies have repercussions for the entire world, even those who are not on Facebook.","And remember, when we say Facebook here, we mean Zuckerberg. Because thanks to the power he holds over the company, Zuckerberg is Facebook and Facebook is Zuckerberg.","To hold Facebook accountable, you’ve got to hold Zuckerberg to account. But Facebook’s dual-class stock is intentionally designed to prevent just that from happening."],"isopubdate":""}

People will be able to enjoy the benefits of social networking without giving up control of their personal information. We’re very pleased Facebook has been responsive to our recommendations.”","Last month, the Privacy Commissioner issued a report on an in-depth investigation triggered by a complaint from the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic.","While Facebook took some steps to resolve privacy concerns, the Commissioner remained dissatisfied by Facebook’s response at the end of the investigation. She was particularly concerned about the risks posed by the over-sharing of personal information with third-party developers of Facebook applications such as games and quizzes.","Facebook was given 30 days to respond to the Commissioner’s report and explain how it would address the outstanding concerns. Following a review of Facebook’s formal response and discussions with company officials, the Commissioner is now satisfied Facebook is on the right path to addressing the privacy gaps on its site.","“Facebook is promising to make significant technological changes to address the issue we felt was the biggest risk for users – the relatively free flow of personal information to more than one million application developers around the world,” says Assistant Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who led the investigation on behalf of the Office.","“Application developers have had virtually unrestricted access to Facebook users’ personal information. The changes Facebook plans to introduce will allow users to control the types of personal information that applications can access.”","An over-arching issue highlighted during the investigation was that the way in which Facebook provides privacy information to users is often confusing or incomplete.","Facebook agreed to changes to help users to better understand how their personal information will be used and, ultimately, to make more informed decisions about how widely to share that information. The Commissioner has reviewed these improvements and will be following up with Facebook as the changes are implemented.","The following is an overview of key issues raised during the investigation and Facebook’s response:","1. Third-party Application Developers","Issue: The sharing of personal information with third-party developers creating Facebook applications such as games and quizzes raises serious privacy risks. With more than one million developers around the globe, the Commissioner is concerned about a lack of adequate safeguards to effectively restrict those developers from accessing users’ personal information, along with information about their online “friends.”","Response: Facebook has agreed to retrofit its application platform in a way that will prevent any application from accessing information until it obtains express consent for each category of personal information it wishes to access. Under this new permissions model, users adding an application will be advised that the application wants access to specific categories of information. The user will be able to control which categories of information an application is permitted to access. There will also be a link to a statement by the developer to explain how it will use the data.","This change will require significant technological changes. Developers using the platform will also need to adapt their applications and Facebook expects the entire process to take one year to implement.","2. Deactivation of Accounts","Issue: Facebook provides confusing information about the distinction between account deactivation – whereby personal information is held in digital storage – and deletion – whereby personal information is actually erased from Facebook servers. As well, Facebook should implement a retention policy under which the personal information of users who have deactivated their accounts will be deleted from the site’s servers after a reasonable length of time.","Response: Facebook has agreed to make it clear to users that they have the option of either deactivating their account or deleting their account. This distinction will be explained in Facebook’s privacy policy and users will receive a notice about the delete option during the deactivation process.","While we asked for a retention policy, we looked at the issue again and considered what Facebook was proposing. We determined the company’s approach – providing clarity about the options, offering a clear choice, and alleviating the confusion – is acceptable because it will allow users to make informed decisions about how their personal information is to be handled.","3. Personal Information of Non-users","Issue: Facebook should better protect the privacy of non-users who are invited to join the site.","Response: Facebook agreed to include more information in its terms of use statement. Facebook confirmed that it does not use email addresses to track the success of its invitation feature, nor does it maintain a separate email address list for this purpose.","4. Accounts of Deceased Users","Issue: People should have a better way to provide meaningful consent to have their account “memorialized” after their death. As such, Facebook should be clear in its privacy policy that it will keep a user’s profile online after death so that friends can post comments and pay tribute.","Response: Facebook agreed to change the wording in its privacy policy to explain what will happen in the event of a user’s death.","Facebook has committed to a timetable for implementing all of the changes, some of which, such as the third-party application changes, are technologically complex. The company has already started to make changes and we expect them to be fully complete within a year.","“It’s now up to Facebook to demonstrate to us that they are living up to their commitments,” says Assistant Commissioner Denham.","“With the conclusion of the Facebook investigation, our Office has made clear our expectations for how social networking sites need to protect personal information. Other sites should take note – and take steps to ensure they’re complying with Canadian law.”","Statements by the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner are available on the OPC’s website.","The Privacy Commissioner of Canada is mandated by Parliament to act as an ombudsman, advocate and guardian of privacy and the protection of personal information rights of Canadians."],"isopubdate":"2011-10-13"}

Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726.","Facebook Rethinks In-Region Data Center Interconnection","Facebook engineers have designed a new way to interconnect the company’s enormous data centers within a single region.","As it builds data centers in more and more new locations around the world, Facebook is also building more data centers per location (or “availability region”) to meet its growing computing demands. This week, for example, the company said it would expand its Papillion, Nebraska, region from two to six data centers.","At Facebook, applications like search, AI, and machine learning are pushing even the highest-capacity networking switches on the market to their limits. They require shuffling vast amounts of data between servers within a region – much more than the amount of data that travels between Facebook’s global network and its users’ devices.","Each building in a region has several network fabrics, which talk to each other through a “fabric aggregation layer,” Sree Sankar, technical product manager at Facebook, explained. The engineers saw big scaling challenges on the horizon in the aggregation layer.","“We were already using the largest switch out there,” she said. “So we had to innovate.”","Sankar spoke about the new solution at the OCP Summit in San Jose, California. The annual conference is put on by the OCP Foundation, which oversees the Open Compute Project, the open source data center hardware design community launched by Facebook in 2011. The company is contributing the solution’s design to OCP.","To continue scaling the aggregation layer, Facebook would need three times more ports than it had at the time (about a year and a half ago), but simply scaling network capacity linearly wouldn’t be sustainable from a data center power perspective, Sankar said. Whatever the solution, it would have to be more energy efficient than what was in place.","Interconnecting Many Fabrics","They built a distributed, disaggregated network system, called Fabric Aggregator, which interconnects many of the Wedge100S switches Facebook designed earlier, and developed a cabling assembly unit to emulate the switch chassis backplane. The system runs on FBOSS (Facebook Open Switching System) software.","It took about five months to design, and the company has been rolling it out in its data centers over the past nine months.","The approach enables Facebook to scale aggregation-layer capacity in big chunks, but in addition to the scaling capabilities came better network resiliency and higher energy efficiency. Since the system is made up of many of the same building blocks, the Wedge100S, any of the switches can go out of service, accidentally or on purpose, without affecting the network’s overall performance.","Facebook","A Fabric Aggregator rack by Facebook","The system can be implemented in a number of different ways. One implementation described in a Facebook blog post is a Fabric Aggregator node (a node is simply a unit of bandwidth being added using the approach) that supports both regional (“east-west”) traffic and inter-regional (“north-south”) traffic.","The two layers – “downstream” for regional and “upstream” for inter-regional – are disaggregated, meaning each one can be scaled independently. The upstream layer’s purpose is to compress the interconnects with Facebook’s backbone network.","The downstream and upstream layers can contain a quasi-arbitrary number of downstream subswitches and upstream subswitches. Separating the solution into two distinct layers allows us to grow the east/west and north/south capacities independently by adding more subswitches as traffic demands change.","Since the basic building blocks are the same across the system, any Wedge100S switch can be taken out of service for debugging without affecting the network’s overall performance:","If we detect a misbehaving subswitch inside a particular node, we can take that specific subswitch out of service for debugging. If there is a need take all downstream and upstream subswitches out of service in a node, our operational tools abstract all the underlying complexities inherent to multiple interactions across many individual subswitches.","The system is more efficient because it requires fewer ASICs to increase the amount of ports. It provides higher port density and 60 percent higher power efficiency, Sankar said.","The team designed a cabling assembly for the Fabric Aggregator. There are single-rack and multi-rack versions of the assembly, each with its own constraints and benefits, and four cabling configurations.","Next Challenge Around the Corner","For Sankar and her colleagues, hitting the limits of what the Fabric Aggregator can do is already on the horizon. With 100G networking, power limits are already being stretched, which may mean major difficulties in the future, when 400G networking arrives. “It’s unsustainable for a 400-Gig data center,” she said.","Speaking at the summit, Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems and founder Arista Networks, one of the largest suppliers of networking equipment to hyper-scale data centers, cited a Dell’Oro Group forecast that said the transition from 100G to 400G will start in 2019, ramp up volume in 2020, and pass 100G in total amount of bandwidth deployed in 2022.","Facebook’s favored solution to the power problem is to include optics and ASICs in the same package, with modified I/O, instead of the current design, where optical modules are plugged into the switch.

According to the Financial Times, reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly filmed a series of meetings, including one with the chief executive. The report is due to air this week.","Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be recalling Nix to give further testimony to explain why he had told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook.","“We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments,” he said.","Collins will also call on Zuckerberg to testify. He said the company appeared to have previously sent executives who were able to avoid difficult questions and who “claimed not to know the answers”.","The two men may also face a summons from US lawmakers. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia.","The Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian.","“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records. It denies using any Facebook data in the campaign.","Shortly before the story broke, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer that it was making “false and defamatory” allegations and reserved Facebook’s legal position. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach.","It also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan.","The public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate.

I’m trying to make amends for my mistakes and so should Facebook,” he told the Guardian. “Facebook has known about this for at least two years and did almost nothing to fix it. This is not new. And it’s only by coming forward that Facebook is now taking action. People need to know this kind of profiling is happening.”","Collins said his committee wanted more information from Facebook about the circumstances around the breach. “Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","Last month, both Facebook representatives and Nix told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from GSR.","Cambridge Analytica chief denies working with Facebook data - video","But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ‘platform policies’ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” the statement said.","Collins attacked Facebook for appearing to have been “deliberately avoiding answering straight questions” in testimony to the committee.","“It is now clear that data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,” Collins said. “Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","Cambridge Analytica responded to the Observer story on Twitter before Collins had said Nix would be recalled. “We refute(s) these mischaracterizations and false allegations,” it said.","“Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data,” the company said. “When we learned GSR sold us Facebook data that it shouldn’t have done, we deleted it all – system wide audit to verify.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Facebook adjusted the privacy settings on its service on Wednesday, giving users control over their personal information in fewer taps. Facebook has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom Corp and Experian PLC. The tool has been widely used among certain categories of advertisers – such as automakers, luxury goods producers and consumer packaged goods companies – who do not sell directly to consumers and have relatively little information about who their customers are, according to Facebook. “While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook,” Graham Mudd, a Facebook product marketing director, said in a statement. Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to US$25 after Facebook’s announcement after the bell. Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged. Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand.","Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network.","He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them.","“Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it.","“Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.”","Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland.","(NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.)","The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges.","The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results).","And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value — and led to a bunch of lawsuits.","“We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on.","“Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.”","He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account.","So, er, ouch.","In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner himself as, er, hostile to privacy…","A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement:","We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further.","This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions.","Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!).","The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning.","Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook.","Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period.","Downloaded FB data also gives you insight into whom else has data on you (used to run custom audiences). Have never engaged with 75% of these… pic.twitter.com/dQPjIcI8CW","“I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.”","Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot.","But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users.","“They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.”","“Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large.","“It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?”","“They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks. If you think about how antitrust laws work, that’s the starting point for those laws. So it’s kind of mindboggling that they don’t see their argumentation, how it’s going to hurt them at some point.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Its full statement is below.","Facebook data breach scandal","The Channel 4 News investigation comes after articles published by the New York Times and U.K. newspaper the Observer, showed how the data of millions of Facebook profiles ended up being given to Cambridge Analytica.","Academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" in 2014. Users were paid to take a psychological test and the app collected the data. It also gathered data on a person's Facebook friends, according to British newspaper The Observer and The New York Times.","In this way, 50 million Facebook profiles were mined for data. Kogan then shared this with Cambridge Analytica, which allowed the firm to build a software solution to help influence choices in elections, according to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who revealed the alleged practices to both newspapers.","Facebook confirmed Friday that it knew about the app and claimed that Kogan \"lied to us\" and violated its terms of service in regards to passing data from \"thisisyourdigitallife\" to a third party.","The social networking site said that around 270,000 people downloaded the app and \"gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile.\" Facebook said the data was gathered in a \"legitimate way.\" It also deleted the app in 2015 and said that it received reassurances that all the data was destroyed too.","But Facebook revealed Friday that it had received reports that not all of the data was actually deleted.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made,\" Facebook said in a blog post. Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform.","Both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica have denied wrongdoing in regards to the reports in The Observer and The New York Times.

The report is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.","Cambridge Analytica held a series of meetings with the undercover reporter to discuss philanthropic, infrastructure and political projects in Sri Lanka. While outlining the company's services as a data-driven communications and marketing agency, a senior Cambridge Analytica executive clearly set out the principles which govern its work and said the following to the undercover reporter:","\"We're not in the business of fake news, we're not in the business of lying, making stuff up, and we're not in the business of entrapment… There are companies that do this but to me that crosses a line.\"","Despite this clear statement, the undercover reporter later attempted to entrap Cambridge Analytica executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. After several meetings discussing ostensibly legitimate projects, the reporter unexpectedly and suddenly turned the conversation towards practices such as corruption and the entrapment of political figures.","Assessing the legality and reputational risks associated with new projects is critical for us, and we routinely undertake conversations with prospective clients to try to tease out any unethical or illegal intentions. The two Cambridge Analytica executives at the meeting humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions. They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again.","We use meetings like this to make an informed decision about those whom we should or shouldn't engage with, in line with the guidance laid out by Section 9 of the UK Bribery Act 2010. The company's practice is for staff to gently de-escalate the conversation before removing themselves from the situation.","However CEO Alexander Nix acknowledges that on this occasion he misjudged the situation:","\"In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case. I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose.","\"I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.\"","Cambridge Analytica is a high-profile company. While we work for clients from all sides of the political mainstream across many countries, some do not want it known that they are using a professional political consultancy. We understand this, and allow our clients to work with us discreetly. This is not unusual in the industry.","Like any marketing agency, Cambridge Analytica uses social media platforms for placing paid advertisements and organic content. Influencer marketing and building grassroots networks on social media are both common activities for a modern political campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

I think it is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself for questioning in front of a parliamentary or congressional hearing, given that these are questions of fundamental importance to Facebook users as well as to our inquiry.","\"I would certainly urge him to think again if he has any concern for the people who use his company's services.\"","Mr Wylie is a former employee of Cambridge Analytica (CA), which allegedly used data gathered from Facebook users in its targeted messaging on behalf of Donald Trump's election campaign in the US.","He said he believed the closely linked Canadian company AggregateIQ had played a \"very significant\" role in securing a Leave vote in Britain's 2016 referendum on EU membership.","AggregateIQ took 40% of the spending by the Vote Leave campaign to target messages at a \"very specific cohort\" of voters who they believed could swing the result, he said.","And he claimed that a representative of the company, which also did work for the pro-Brexit BeLeave, DUP and Veterans for Britain campaigns, told him that its activities were \"totally illegal\".","He said he \"absolutely\" believed that AIQ drew on CA databases in the campaign, telling the committee: \"Cambridge Analytica would have a database and AIQ would access that database, otherwise the software wouldn't work.\"","Mr Wylie said it was clear when he made a pitch for work with Vote Leave in late 2015 that the campaign had no database to work from, but that the situation changed after it hired AIQ shortly afterwards.","\"My question is where did you get that data? How do you create a massive targeting operation, in a country that AIQ hadn't previously worked in, in two months?\" he asked.","Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings dismissed Mr Wylie as a \"fantasist-charlatan\" in a blog post written while the pink-haired whistle-blower was still giving evidence.","By the time inquiries by the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office were complete, \"the Observer will look really silly for making a hero out of a fantasist-charlatan, we'll already have left the EU, and Zoolander will need a new look,\" predicted Mr Cummings.","But Mr Wylie insisted that AIQ had a record of \"converting\" around 5-7% of voters who viewed its material.","And he said: \"I think it is completely reasonable to say there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating...","\"It makes me so angry because a lot of people supported Leave because they believe in the application of British law and British sovereignty and to irrevocably alter the constitutional settlement of this country on the basis of fraud is a mutilation of the constitutional settlement of this country.\"","Mr Wylie alleged that AIQ had been involved in attempted hacking and the distribution of lurid videos of torture and murder during the 2015 Nigerian presidential election, as well as a scheme to monitor the internet traffic of the entire population of Trinidad & Tobago.","\"This is a company that has worked with hacked material, this is a company that will send out videos of people being murdered to intimidate voters, this is a company that goes out and tries to illicitly acquire live internet browsing data of everyone in an entire country,\" said Mr Wylie.","\"I think a lot of questions should be asked about the role of AIQ in this election and whether they were indeed compliant with the law here.\"","Mr Wylie dismissed as \"weasel words\" AIQ's insistence that it was not a part of the SCL Group which founded CA to work on the American election, describing the Canadian firm as a \"franchise\" operation.","The testimony to the committee from SCL's suspended chief executive Alexander Nix that CA had not used Facebook data was \"categorically untrue... not only misleading, but dishonest\", he said.","Asked if he hoped his disclosures would bring SCL and CA down, he replied: \"Frankly, yes. Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica.","\"It is not a legitimate business. SCL is not a legitimate business. I don't think that they should remain in business.\"","In a letter to Mr Collins, Facebook's head of public policy Rebecca Stimson said that the company would be putting forward chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer or chief product officer Chris Cox to answer MPs' questions.","Both are among Facebook's longest serving senior representatives and are \"well placed to answer the committee's questions on these complex subjects\" straight after the end of Parliament's Easter recess on April 16, she said.","Mr Collins said the committee would be happy to issue an invitation to Mr Cox, but made clear that he was not withdrawing the call for Mr Zuckerberg to give evidence.","\"Facebook has got many questions to answer that their executives have failed to answer in previous appearances before our committee,\" he said.","\"Given the seriousness of these issues, we still believe that Mark Zuckerberg is the right person to give evidence... He stated in interviews that if he is the right person to appear, he will appear. We think he is the right person and look forward to hearing from him.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

But Channel 4 News has now discovered that data on thousands of people in Colorado is still circulating – and Channel 4 News has been to speak to those whose privacy was breached.","Cambridge Analytica’s US campaign data, which was harvested from Facebook, is still circulating – despite assurances it has been deleted.","Channel 4 News has seen part of the information extrapolated from 50 million people’s Facebook profiles and activity.","The cache of campaign data from a Cambridge Analytica source, details 136,000 individuals in the US state of Colorado, along with each person’s personality and psychological profile.","The data, which dates from 2014, was used by Cambridge Analytica to target specific messages at residents who would be most susceptible to them.","As the harvesting scandal grew last week, Cambridge Analytica insisted all Facebook data it held, and any information they had derived using the Facebook data, “had been deleted”.","Facebook also said it took steps to ensure all information related to harvested profiles was “destroyed”.","But the Colorado dataset, along with similar data for Oregon, suggests copies of the Facebook-derived data still exists, and raises questions about who still has them.","The data is also known to have been passed around using generic, non-corporate email systems, outside of the servers of Cambridge Analytica, and linked company SCL.","Now, more than a week after the revelations that disgraced Cambridge Analytica and ripped through Facebook’s reputation, Channel 4 News has spoken directly to those whose privacy was breached.","And residents in the middle-class suburb of Arvada, in the swing state of Colorado, were told: “If we [Channel 4 News] can get a copy of it, users would be naïve to assume that someone else can’t as well.”","Janice, a nurse whose data is included in the cache, said: “It’s a manipulation of our society by people who don’t really care about our society. They care about their business. They care about their bottom line and they aren’t here for all of us, other than they want to manipulate all of us because we’re either a voter or a consumer. And that’s how they look at me, they don’t look at how safe I am, or how good my schools are.”","On Sunday Mark Zuckerberg issued full-page newspaper adverts apologising for the Facebook data scandal. But when asked how she felt about his apology, Janice told Channel 4 News:","“He didn’t do it until people deleted their profiles and started closing their accounts. He didn’t care about America until it was going to hit his bottom line or he thought the trend might go the wrong way. And so, in that, it just made me more disgusted with him.”","Debra, a local resident said: “It’s personal information, and just to have strangers be able to make an assessment about who we are and what our views are… whether it’s accurate or inaccurate… It’s unnerving to think that someone has and is keeping track of that information. I’m questioning if I scroll down something and click on it, to look at it more what’s involved in the post, then that’s them gathering data as well. It makes me really hesitant to even want to engage to that degree.”","Householder Barbara was asked: “Does it worry you that somehow people have extracted this information about you from your online profile?”","She said: “It doesn’t worry me … I just figured they were.”","The system of Facebook personality profiles was devised by Cambridge Analytica in line with ground-breaking research by scientists at Cambridge University that built personality profiles from people’s social media.","Sources have told Channel 4 News the Cambridge Analytica data was used by the Republicans in Colorado to help target voters.","The Cambridge Analytica data was allegedly also used by President Trump’s incoming national security adviser John Bolton, according to reports in the New York Times. Mr Bolton’s political action committee, known as The John Bolton Super PAC, first hired Cambridge in August 2014, months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data.","Since revelations were first broadcast on 17 March 2018, Channel 4 News has asked Mr Zuckerberg repeatedly for an interview. The Facebook CEO has repeatedly declined.","Responding to the latest revelations, Facebook’s Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, Paul Grewal, said: “What happened with Cambridge Analytica represents a breach of trust for which we are very sorry. It is now clear to us that there’s more that we could have done, and as Mark Zuckerberg said, we are working hard to tackle past abuse and are committed to letting people know if their data was inappropriately accessed or misused.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our policy by passing data from an app to SCL/Cambridge Analytica.","“When we learned of this violation, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they had destroyed the data in question in 2015.","“Two weeks ago, we received reports from media, including Channel 4, that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted.

We want to assure people that we have suspended Cambridge Analytica from Facebook.” – Paul Grewal, VP & Deputy General Counsel.”","A Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said: “We have never passed any data from GSR to an external party. After Facebook contacted us in December 2015 we deleted all GSR data and took appropriate steps to ensure that any copies of the data were deleted. This includes our lawyers taking action in late 2014 against a number of former staff members who had stolen data and intellectual property from the company.

It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies.

Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August.

This would give you, the consumer, the right to say, ‘look, I am going to choose to share certain portions of what I want to share and what I want to lock away.’”","The Tennessee congresswoman argued that now is the time for Congress to define what levels of privacy Americans should have on the Internet.","“We’re finally arriving at the point we people realize that something needs to be done,” Blackburn told Breitbart News. “This is not necessarily a step towards regulation; it is a step for Congress to take action. This is going to be a time to define what data security expectations we’re going to have in the virtual space.”","The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they have opened an investigation into Facebook, citing “substantial concerns” about Facebook’s treatment of users’ private information.","Blackburn suggested that the FTC investigation will cause the agency to “look at the policies of your edge providers to make certain that they are more transparent with the consumer.”","Rep. Blackburn then suggested that Internet privacy will become the next big technology issue, saying, “I think it’s going to be privacy and ownership. Whether you’re dealing with your healthcare information or your online information, privacy and ownership is going to be part of the conversation.”","Blackburn concluded, “Who owns the digital you? Is it you or the search engine or the edge provider that is providing the service?”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

It also denied that the Facebook data was used by the Trump campaign and says it didn't work on the Brexit referendum.","The company insisted Wylie was a contractor, not a founder.","For Facebook, the controversy appears to be taking a toll. On Monday, Facebook shares fell $12.53 US or 6.77 per cent to $172.56 US on the New York Stock Exchange.","Facebook has denied the data collection was a breach because people knowingly provided their information. The company has said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his test via his Facebook app.","Facebook has also said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan's app. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now.","'We have to be alert,' says Goodale","On Monday, Facebook said it hired a digital forensics firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine if the Facebook data the company collected still exists or if it's been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica agreed to give the auditor complete access to its servers and systems, Facebook said.","The social-media giant said it's also asked Wylie and Kogan to submit to an audit as well. It said Kogan has given his verbal agreement to do so and Wylie has declined.","The Facebook data breach exposed by Wylie in recent days has caused a commotion on both sides of the Atlantic and has caught the attention of Canada's privacy watchdog.","Facebook's latest privacy scandal sent its stock into a downward spiral, with the company seeing its biggest single-day drop in four years. Facebook's stock dropped nearly seven per cent, losing more than $40 billion in market capitalization.

What they unwittingly did was give their data to Cambridge Analytica.","But that’s the point — people give away alot of very personal information to Facebook. Then they just as quickly give it away to third parties without really knowing what in heaven’s name they’re doing with the information.","Here are the three basic ways we’re handing over very personal information — our birthday, our “likes,” our preferences, who we’re friends with online — and how quickly it can be taken from us.","1. The simple act ofsigning upfor Facebook","It’s that simple. Some people think Facebook doesn’t have all that much information on them because they rarely use it. You may be a lurker. How much data can Facebook really have on you?","A lot! If you’re curious about what kind of data Facebook has about you, you can follow these steps to download your personal Facebook history. In these archives you’ll find fun things you probably never thought were stored on a server somewhere about you.","The archive contains a list of IP addresses that you’ve used to logged into your Facebook account, ads that you clicked on, and cell phone numbers associated with your account.","Facebook also tracks this type of data you entered onto the platform:","A facial recognition ID that is associated with your photo and is used to identify images of you","Your maiden name","Credit card information","Your hometown","Your political views","Your addresses","Any networks you’re associated with — like colleges or companies you belonged to","2. The even simpler act of using Facebook","Facebook keeps detailed data of all your preferences and every one of your “likes” — and it leverages that information for super-precise ad targeting. By reacting to Facebook posts, it’s kind of like you’re participating in an ongoing consumer survey exclusively for Facebook.","Your activity log can give you a pretty good idea of your Facebook behavior over time. It’s a record of all your activities from today all the way back to the day you signed up for your account. Here, you’ll find every like, :haha:, :wow:, :angry:, :love:, and :sad: reaction you’ve ever made to a Facebook post; every video, song, and photo you’ve looked at, listened to, posted, and been tagged in. It also keeps every change to your profile you’ve ever made.","3. Signing in to third-party apps through Facebook","You know that convenient option of logging into a third-party app with your Facebook credentials? Once you click “continue,” you’re allowing this app — it could be Spotify, Farmville, or, say, a survey being conducted by a Russian-American academic connected to Cambridge Analytica — to access a ton of the precious personal data that Facebook has on you.","For example, if you use Tinder via Facebook, you have to hand over at least some basic information about your public profile, which includes your name, your gender, and anything else you posted publicly about yourself.","By default, the app also asks for access to a complete list of your friends, what genders you are interested in, your birthday, your work and educational history, any photo you’ve ever uploaded or are tagged in, any pages and groups you like, and your email address.","Unless you edit the default settings upon your first Tinder login — and you probably don’t — you automatically give the dating app all this data.","These are only a few of the data points that apps may ask for. Here’s a complete list.","Back in 2014 — when the academic linked to Cambridge Analytica, Aleksandr Kogan, used his app to collect data — Facebook users were also able to give third-party apps permission to gather not just personal information but also the information of their friends. At the time, this data included things like the check-ins, locations, and interests of a user’s friend.","“The news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica should serve as a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks in a world where a near-endless stream of personal information is collected indefinitely stored, analyzed, and re-used by marketers, identity thieves, and professional government snoops,” Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told BuzzFeed News through a spokesperson."],"isopubdate":""}

Caspar said: “It is and will remain Facebook’s business model to collect data and make it accessible to people with the right profiles in exchange for money.” Caspar attended a high-level meeting between German Justice Minster Katarina Barley and senior Facebook representatives in Berlin on Monday. The data protection officer subsequently lamented that no convincing proposals had been made on behalf of Facebook to redress the situation. Barley has demanded a “comprehensive investigation” into whether German users were affected by the illegal use of information from millions of Facebook profiles during “electoral strategy” work by the company Cambridge Analytica for the U.S. Trump presidential campaign and the British Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum. The justice minister went as far as to describe the social network as a “threat to democracy and the rule of law”. She further emphasized that it was the responsibility and right of the European Union and its member state governments to determine the rules of the game by which tech companies must operate in the bloc. According to media reports, Cambridge Analytica used an application designed by the Russian academic Aleksandr Kogan to illegally access the data of around 50 million Facebook users. The information was used for targeted campaign advertisements, “micro-targeting” to sway voters in favor of casting their ballot for U.S. President Donald Trump or to vote Leave in the British referendum. In a recent appearance before the British parliament, ex-Cambridge programmer Christopher Wylie shocked delegates by stating that he had not doubt that his former employer had manipulated the Brexit referendum and broken the law."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign.

And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The data inside was not particularly usable for a Facebook user, except on Facebook.","But with all the controversy surrounding Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data of 50 million user profiles was misused, many users are reexamining their own relationship with the platform and the data it has.","It takes a few minutes for Facebook to prepare your archive into a .zip file to download, and once it’s unzipped, you can view it by double-clicking on the file “index.htm.” (The interface is web-based and will open in a browser.)","What your archive says","Your digital life, compressed into an archive, may be bizarre to see. Your relationships, should you have made them public are front and center in your details. Your email addresses, the names you used on Facebook (I used a fake name until 2014), your workplaces (one of mine just says “yes yes hi hello”), and all the things you “liked.”","Over the years, Facebook had different ways to deal with that stuff, so everything doesn’t quite match up perfectly. There used to be a place for favorite movies and books, and most of that merged to a general “Other” category. (Except for the movies category, which for me still displays “Roadhouse.”)","Among the items in the file are your entire timeline, which includes posts from previous iterations of Facebook, when posting on people’s walls, which comprised the bulk of a user’s interactions on the platform. (Perhaps it was not even a platform yet.)","Everything you and others posted is there, including all the things people wrote, assuming they were simply shouting into the abyss, figuring no one was listening. Facebook was, and they wrote it down!","Also present are the ad topics Facebook thinks you’d be into, the ads you’ve actually clicked on — this doesn’t seem complete, it says I clicked on only a few in just 2018 — and the advertisers that possess your data. Some of them are really weird: A friend texted me to say that “Rod Stewart” is listed under the advertisers that have his data. My editor’s archive showed that a bunch of cruise lines — and the musician Beck – had her data. (She has no idea why, and when asked whether she even likes Beck said, “I don’t know?”)","Most unnerving perhaps, are the private messages, compiled in one place. We get new phones or clear our old phone texts, but Facebook doesn’t have storage issues. It’s all here.","All of this should not be news to you. Facebook’s 3 billion users give this information willingly, and we certainly expect the company not to delete old posts. But the archive, compiled for the benefit of the user, puts the concept into alarming relief, showing exactly how much of our lives we’ve poured into it. And of course, how easy it is to condense a digital life into a .zip file.","It’s scary, but it’s not a surprise","When you post a photo on Facebook, you expect it to be available — even years later. Recently, Facebook even made a feature on this, showing friend retrospectives for friend anniversaries in your newsfeed. Similarly, the motivation for the collection of some of this data – advertising – was detailed in the fine print. Unfortunately, most don’t read the fine print and thus miss this devil in the details. (Though the fact that a 13-year-old is expected to read and understand this may trouble some.)","How Facebook can interpret all this data may be of more interest. You can see what their conclusions are if you read this article. From the data you provide as a user, what you “like” on the platform, they can get a decent picture of who you are.","Another friend and Facebook user I talked with noted that it was interesting that people seem more concerned with “psychographic data” rather than the fact that Equifax exposed 150 million Social Security numbers, something that has identity theft and financial security implications. The answer, of course, is because there’s a small-ish .zip file —mine was 34 megabytes filled with secrets. If it got loose, it would be pure KOMPROMAT. (Update your password.)","From a personal data hygiene perspective, if all this doesn’t sit well with you, the only thing you can really do is delete the contacts you may have uploaded to Facebook. Though you can make things hidden, purging the site of your data seems to mean full-scale account deletion, if you want to set fire to your old activity."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

For many of us in market research the concepts of consent and transparency are hard-wired into us.

For anyone working in the research and insights industry this kind of data collection is clearly illegal. The industry has fought hard to keep self-regulation. There are of course checks and balances; data protection is regulated, in the UK this is carried out by the ICO (information commissioner’s office), and most research and data collection companies are members of long-standing trade associations that compel them to sign up to a set of ethical codes, to safeguard public privacy and ensure consent, which is fundamental to maintaining public confidence in the research profession.","If proven true, and the ICO finds evidence of wrong-doing by the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, you can expect far reaching repercussions. People understand now, more than ever, the value and power of their personal data. The Cambridge Analytica case will now demonstrate the extent to which (supposedly) private data can be used to manipulate them.","But for the public and lawmakers alike, data collection is data collection, and a data breach is a data breach. So even if those in the research industry can see a clear and unequivocal difference between the Cambridge Analytica profile scraping – or the exposure of the personal data of 57 million Uber users back in 2016 – and the insights profession diligently regulated systems, lawmakers and the public do not. The question is, should they? This miscomprehension is indicative of a staggering disconnect between the ethical and legal considerations of some of those involved in new tech, and everyone else. A recent report this year from the Market Research Society on consumer trust in the UK claimed that the security of personal data was (and is) the biggest driver of consumer trust in the UK, and 51 per cent of consumers do not want companies to use any of their data at all.","The research and insight industry has a long and successful track record in self-regulation, and will continue to fight for that status, in order to clearly distinguish itself from less ethical practices. The research and insights profession is worth over $6.6 bn in the UK alone in 2017. Market and opinion research is used to guide the creation of new policies and laws; charity and public opinion research aims to (eg) help refugees have a voice, and social research helps us to (eg) understand and support the lives of the LGBTQ community in countries with under-developed social legislation or particular social mores.","An un-regulated data collection industry potentially stifles all that good (essential) work and makes it harder for law abiding and ethical researchers to understand and reach people, and help governments, societies and businesses make more pertinent decisions. If companies continue to (ab)use personal data as a commodity, forgetting that they are really dealing with the lives of people, then the call for regulation will increase.","It is vital that companies in the emerging tech space look to engage with the checks and balances that exist in data protection and the research and insight space, and not just engage, but also contribute by the demonstrable provision of privacy standards, respect and consent to their customers/users. Not only will that ensure that the consumer information they hold can be used, but it will also radically improve the trust these companies are currently haemorrhaging, and safeguard their ability to innovate further into the future, with other data types.","Finn Raben is the Director General of ESOMAR, a member-based industry body that represents a global community of 40,000 research and insights professionals.","The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

A junior member of a large and powerful organization with a thin, but impressive, résumé, he was about to take on far more powerful forces in a battle for leadership.","He wondered if social networking, with its tremendous communication capabilities and aggressive database development, might help him beat the overwhelming odds facing him.","“It was like a guy in a garage who was thinking of taking on the biggest names in the business,” Mr. Andreessen recalled. “What he was doing shouldn’t have been possible, but we see a lot of that out here and then something clicks. He was clearly supersmart and very entrepreneurial, a person who saw the world and the status quo as malleable.”","Like a lot of Web innovators, the Obama campaign did not invent anything completely new. Instead, by bolting together social networking applications under the banner of a movement, they created an unforeseen force to raise money, organize locally, fight smear campaigns and get out the vote that helped them topple the Clinton machine and then John McCain and the Republicans.","As a result, when he arrives at 1600 Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama will have not just a political base, but a database, millions of names of supporters who can be engaged almost instantly. And there’s every reason to believe that he will use the network not just to campaign, but to govern. His e-mail message to supporters on Tuesday night included the line, “We have a lot of work to do to get our country back on track, and I’ll be in touch soon about what comes next.” The incoming administration is already open for business on the Web at Change.gov, a digital gateway for the transition.","The Bush campaign arrived at the White House with a conviction that it would continue a conservative revolution with the help of Karl Rove’s voter lists, phone banks and direct mail. But those tools were crude and expensive compared with what the Obama camp is bringing to the Oval Office.","“I think it is very significant that he was the first post-boomer candidate for president,” Mr. Andreessen said. “Other politicians I have met with are always impressed by the Web and surprised by what it could do, but their interest sort of ended in how much money you could raise. He was the first politician I dealt with who understood that the technology was a given and that it could be used in new ways.”","The juxtaposition of a networked, open-source campaign and a historically imperial office will have profound implications and raise significant questions. Special-interest groups and lobbyists will now contend with an environment of transparency and a president who owes them nothing. The news media will now contend with an administration that can take its case directly to its base without even booking time on the networks.","More profoundly, while many people think that President-elect Obama is a gift to the Democratic Party, he could actually hasten its demise. Political parties supply brand, ground troops, money and relationships, all things that Mr. Obama already owns.","And his relationships are not the just traditional ties of Democrats — teachers’ unions, party faithful and Hollywood moneybags — but a network of supporters who used a distributed model of phone banking to organize and get out the vote, helped raise a record-breaking $600 million, and created all manner of media clips that were viewed millions of times. It was an online movement that begot offline behavior, including producing youth voter turnout that may have supplied the margin of victory.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","“Thomas Jefferson used newspapers to win the presidency, F.D.R. used radio to change the way he governed, J.F.K. was the first president to understand television, and Howard Dean saw the value of the Web for raising money,” said Ranjit Mathoda, a lawyer and money manager who blogs at Mathoda.com. “But Senator Barack Obama understood that you could use the Web to lower the cost of building a political brand, create a sense of connection and engagement, and dispense with the command and control method of governing to allow people to self-organize to do the work.”","All of the Obama supporters who traded their personal information for a ticket to a rally or an e-mail alert about the vice presidential choice, or opted in on Facebook or MyBarackObama can now be mass e-mailed at a cost of close to zero. And instead of the constant polling that has been a motor of presidential governance, an Obama White House can use the Web to measure voter attitudes.","“When you think about it, a campaign is a start-up business,” Mr. Mathoda said. “Other than his speech in 2004 at the convention and his two books, Mr. Obama had very little in terms of brand to begin with, and he was up against Senator Clinton, who had all the traditional sources of power, and then Senator McCain. But he had the right people and the right idea to take them on. When you think about it, it was like he was going up against Google and Yahoo. And he won.”","There is tremendous power in opening citizen access to government — think of how much good will and support Mayor Michael Bloomberg garnered by coming up with 311, a one-stop phone number for New Yorkers who had a problem.","But now Senator Obama’s 20-month conversation with the electorate enters a new phase. There is sense of ownership, a kind of possessive entitlement, on the part of the people who worked to elect him. The shorthand for his organizing Web site, “MyBO,” says it all.","“People will continue to expect a conversation, a two-way relationship that is a give and take,” said Thomas Gensemer, managing partner of Blue State Digital, which helped conceive and put into effect Obama’s digital outreach. “People who were part of the campaign will opt in to political or governing tracks and those relationships will continue in some form.”","The founders of America wanted a government that reflected its citizens, but would be at remove from the baser impulses of the mob. The mob, flush with victory, is at hand, but instead of pitchforks and lanterns, they have broadband and YouTube. Like every other presidency, the Obama administration will have its battles with the media, but that may seem like patty-cake if it runs afoul of the self-publishing, self-organizing democracy it helped create — say, by delaying health care legislation or breaking a promise on taxes.","That’s the thing about pipes today: they run both ways.","“It’s clear there has been a dramatic shift,” said Andrew Rasiej, the founder of the Personal Democracy Forum, an annual conference about the intersection of politics and technology. “Any politician who fails to recognize that we are in a post-party era with a new political ecology in which connecting like minds and forming a movement is so much easier will not be around long.","“Yes, we have met Big Brother, the one who is always watching. And Big Brother is us.”"],"isopubdate":"2008-11-09"}

As in, it told the users it would collect their data for political purposes. This is ethical. The app also collected the data from the friends of the target without their knowledge or consent. That is unethical and should be called out.On the other hand, CA collected data purportedly for academic purposes and used it for something else entirely. It was completely unethical and a breach of trust. If you are familiar with GDPR, this is possibly a prime violation of that law.

Same with \"conservative\" I'm sure.Zuckerburg has donated to candidates on both parties, and is not registered as democrat nor republican. (I had to look this up.) So, it's difficult to assign a broad label to him. If you want to continue this conversation, let's take it to its own thread - Peter's been accommodating but we've hijacked his post enough. :-)","+Samuel Smith I would suggest you google Carol Davidisen who has admitted that Facebook turned a blind eye to Obama harvesting data “because we were on the same side”. That should put an end to this discussion of whether Facebook was liberal or not. My point of view is if you are an obama supporter, you are regarded as liberal.","+Peter Vogel This NEW VIDEO from today (live talk at Frontline Club in London, posted live by SVT [Swedish News]), starting at 22 minutes into it, IS IN ENGLISH and has lots of DETAILS ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY AND RESEARCH (before \"Cambridge Analytica\" came to be and is quite interesting)…svt.se - Visselblåsaren Christopher Wylie om Facebook-skandalen: ”Jag har förstått vilken makt Facebook har över ditt liv”[ note that the organization in London \"Frontline Club\" has not yet put the video on YouTube, therefore pointing you to Swedish News ]At 43m 30s he starts talking about the modern tech and comparing to information 40 years ago.
